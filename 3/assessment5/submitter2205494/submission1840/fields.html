    <h1>Submission 1840 from Anon (session_user_id: 801370dc56822559c6e6625571c5c6b13dd82967)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine , 5-aza-2'- deoxycytidine, is a nucleoside analog that is FDA approved for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) leading to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  The mode of action is that when the enzyme DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) encounters Decitabine in the DNA, it can not methylate it since it lacks the carbon in the 5 position (as in cytidine) which is replaced by a nitrogen.  DNMT is thus irreversibly bound and thus gets depleted.  This prevents the locus specific hypermethylation and reverses the epimutation that leads to MDS and AML.</p>
<p>While Decitabine is not indicated for solid tumors, it should have a synergistic effect when used in conjunction with histone deacetylase inhibitors.  This combination has been shown to be effective against solid tumors in the case of its close relative 5-azacytidine by Dr. Stephen Baylin.  This reinforces the idea that epigenetic mechanisms are interrelated and rarely act in isolation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic machinery does not work as parts having a single function but variety of roles depending on  context.  Similarly drugs affecting the epigenome function in many interrelated ways.  Dr.  Baylin while researching DNMTi drugs found  these drugs rendered tumor cells susceptible to other therapeutic agents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His first observation was the effectiveness of DNMTi drugs was enhanced in low doses rather than previously used high cytotoxic doses.  Thus clearly the mode was epigenetic reversing  hypermethylation of specific loci.  These epigenetic changes are stably inherited mitotically and thus persist beyond drug usage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We learnt in class that all cancers share certain hallmarks, one of which is enabling replicative immortality thus conferring some stem cell like behavior to cancer cells.  Stem cells and cells in sensitive periods such as pre and post implantation, primordial germ cell development and gametogenesis undergo active epigenome remodeling and are especially vulnerable to the environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dr. Baylin thinks that epigentic drugs acting during this plastic stage can cut down this self regenerative behavior in cancer and leave them susceptible to chemotherapy.  One should thus also take care not to use these drugs on younger people so as to not damage gametogenesis.  Also affected is ability to avoid immune destruction.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is both a genetic and epigenetic disease with a strong interaction between  genome and epigenome.  The genetic basis of cancer was studied first but the epigenetics and  interrelationships are being pursued only recently.  Known epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modification and remodeling, nuclear architecture changes and non-coding RNA.  These mechanisms interact with one another as well.  Of these DNA methylation is the best studied and tracked.</p>
<p>In a normal cell there is a high degree of genome wide DNA methylation with the exception of CpG islands (especially in promoters) with no DNA methylation.  In cancer this pattern is reversed with genomewide hypomethylation and hypermethylation in specific regions such as CpG islands which extends out to a 2 kilobase region on either side of the promoter termed CpG island shore.  This pattern forms a continuous effect from normal , hyperplasm, neoplasm and metastasis.</p>
<p>This hypermethylation in the promoter region silences tumor suppressing genes and aids in other silencing epimutations such as histone methylation (H3K27) and remodeling  changes in nuclear architecture leading to silencing.  These add up to multiple hits in the Knudson scheme to promote and maintain cancer.  This can happen in single genes e.g. RB(retinoblastoma), BRCA1(breast cancer) or in sets of genes termed CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) prevalent in gliomas or neuroblastomas.  These differ in prognosis, diagnosis and tumor types.</p>
<p>The other side is the intergenic regions, introns and repeats which are hypermethylated in normal cells and hypomethylated in cancer.  Methylation in normal cells prevents illegitmate recombination from  repeats  and promotes genome stability. </p>
<p>Hypomethylation of repeats leads to genomic instability by promoting translocations, deletions, insertions and other mutations knocking out genes.  All these constitute hits on the way to cancer.  Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters leads to activation of oncogenes and contribute to disease as in gastric cancer (R-RAS).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is a phenomenon that allows for allele specific expression of genes.  A small number of mammalian genes, predominantly ones involved in growth regulation are controlled by imprinting.  There is differential methylation of the parental alleles leading to silencing of one of them.</p>
<p>An example is the H19/Igf2 cluster where normally the paternal copy is methylated at the imprint control region (ICR) and at the promoter of H19.  The maternal copy is unmethylated in both of these regions.  An insulator protein CTCF binds to the unmethylated ICR in the maternal allele and prevents access of downstream enhancers to Igf2 which is therefore not expressed and H19 is, as second choice.  The paternal allele ICR being methylated prevents CTCF binding and allows enhancers to express Igf2 and thus just normal dose of the growth promoter is seen.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor methylation of the ICRs is disrupted with both maternal and paternal ICRs being hypermethylated and thus both express Igf2 leading to tumor formation.  Since many growth regulating genes are imprinted, disruptions of ICR methylation could lead to overexpression of growth promoters or loss of function of growth restricting genes contributing to cancer.  This is a very early marker often present in pre-neoplastic tissues.  </p></div>
