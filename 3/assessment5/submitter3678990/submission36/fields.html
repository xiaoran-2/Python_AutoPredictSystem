    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated. In contrast, in cancer cells a hypermethylation can be observed in the CpG islands and a hypomethylation can be observed in the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements.</p>
<p>The hypermethylation observed in the CpG islands in the cancer cells alters the behaviour of that cell, since this hypermethylation provokes the silencing of tumour supressors genes (these genes are related to the growth of the tumour). </p>
<p>The hypomethylation  observed in the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements provokes DNA instability and this causes alterations in the chromosomes as well as alterations in the nuclear architecture.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the H19 in the paternal allele is methylated as well as the imprint control region (ICR). In this case, the enhancers do not act on H19 (because it is methylated) and act on the Igf2 (therefore, Igf2 is expressed). In the maternal allele H19 is not methylated an the ICR is not methylated either. In this case, the CTCF binds to the ICR and it isulates this element and the enhancers act on H19 (so this is expressed) but do not act on Igf2 (therefore, this is silent). Igf2 promotes growth.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour cells the maternal allele is also methylated, therefore, the enhacers will act in the same way they do in the paternal alelle. So, there is an overexpression of Igf2 and this overexpression contributes to the growth of the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the group of DNA-demethylating agents. In this case, this drug inhibits or blocks the DNMT (DNA methyltransferase) enzyme because the DNMT bind irreversibly to this drug, and therefore inhibits methylation to occur in the DNA. Since one of the phenomena observed in cancer cells is a hypermethylation of the CpG islands (and most of the times this produces a silencing of the tumour supressor genes), by inhibiting this methylation to occur the growth of the tumours could slow down in these cells since the epigenetic marks (methylation) will be erased from this cells.The "problem" of these drugs is that they are not tumour specific, so they inhibit DNMT in all of the cells. However, since this drug is replication dependent, its effects will be more pronounced in those cells that replicate more actively (the tumour cells).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This drug is removing epigenetic marks (methylation) and these marks are mitotically heritable (therefore, the daughter cells will show the same epigenetic marks once the cell divides). For this reason, altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those where epigenetic marks are removed or cleared. This happens in the early embryonic development and in germ cell development.</p>
<p>These drugs are not tumour specific so they will alter the epigenetic marks in the normal cells also and they could have some undesirable side effects. For this reason, they are not recommended (or they should be used carefully) in children (the germ cells will be developing and they could result altered) and I would not recommed them in pregnant women (especially during the early embryonic development). In addition, I would say that these drugs should be carefully used in people that are in the reproductive age (to avoid problems with their descendants) unless they are sure they do not want to have children (or more children) and/or their gametes (sperm or oocytes or ovarian cortex) are cryopreserved before these people are treated with these drugs (so gametes could be used later with Artifical Reproductive Techniques).</p></div>
