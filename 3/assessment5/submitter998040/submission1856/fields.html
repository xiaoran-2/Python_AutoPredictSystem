    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Usually CpG islands are found unmethylated independently of their state, but in most of the cancers, CpG islands are found hypermethylated, most of the times this lead to gene inactivation (often gene promoters are nearby CpG islands, when hypermethylated lead to gene silencing through promoter). CpG regions in intragenic and repetitive elements are methylated to silence the expression of this regions and possibly regulate gene explicing. When in cancer this marks can be loose leading to genetic instability, antisense expression and production of proteins without correct splicing.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the normal features of cancer is the losing of imprinting, in the H19/Igf2 scenario means the hypermethylation of the maternal allele that leads this allele to behave like the paternal allele (normally hypermethylated), which lead to the absence of expression of H19 and the double expression of Igf2, this phenomena its associated with <span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Wilm’s tumour.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Decitabine is a drug, sold as Dacogen, it belongs to the </span></span></span><span style="color:#4a4a4a;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span>DNA-demethylating agents</span></span></span><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span> class, it works by removing methyl groups from DNA, as we know, DNA hypermethylation its a trademark of certain types of cancer. Dacogen mode of action its surely associated with removing this “abnormal” methyl marks </span></span></span><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>from</span></span></span><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span> DNA, leading on this way the normal expression of the genes associated with the region.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Epigenetic marks are mythotical inherit, that means that they survive through generations of the same cell line. That gives an explanation to why epigenetic related treatment can cause long term effects.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Sensitive periods, are space of time when a lot of re-arrange of epigenetic marks are being done through the genome, like pre-implatantion of the zygote or the formation of the gametes to mention a couple. Treating a patient during this periods (pregnant women or trying to get pregnant, males trying to impregnate, child’s under developing, etc)would not be advise because the drugs most likely would affect the epigenetic marks, normal and "cancer related", indistinctly, possibly leading to even more complications.</span></span></span></p></div>
