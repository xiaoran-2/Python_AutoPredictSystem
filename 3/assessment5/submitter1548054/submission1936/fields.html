    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal somatic cells CpG islands normally exist in a hypomethylation state.  This allows promoter sites to be accessible to cellular genetic regulatory mechanisms and operate in a normal way.  In cancer CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated and thus interfering with the promoter binding site causing tumor suppressor genes to be “turned off” as well as other important cell protection and maintenance genes.  Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor promoters cause the cell to operate without a breaking mechanism that would normally keep uncontrolled propagation in check.  In addition to the CpG islands the CpG island shores that cover the 2kb range upstream and downstream of the promoter also tend to be methylated in conjunction with the CpG islands and also disrupt the cells normal regulatory machinery.</p>
<p>In normal cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are in a methylated state.  These areas become hypomethylated in cancer cells causing long stretches of hypomethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements combined with the specific hypermethylation of the intervening CpG islands in the promoter region.  The lack of methylation ( hypomethylation)  of the intergenic region and repetitive elements also plays an important role in disruption in cancer.  The normal methylated status of these areas help keep the cell stable my minimizing insertions, deletions and translocations.  With the loss of methylation in these area.  In mouse models where DNMT is knocked out in specific tissue it creats a hypomethylation environment and resulting genomic instability.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of cpG poor promoters can result in activation of genes particularly oncogenes such as R-RAS in gastric cancer.  The hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters is less common the hypomthylation of repeats.  As described above DNA methylation is context specific and the gain or loss of methylation  can have detrimental effects the depending on the location.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele the imprinting control region (ICR) upstream of the H19 gene is methylated as well as the H19 gene promoter.  As a result of this methylation in normal cells the paternal allele expresses the Igf2 gene as the downstream enhancers drive the expression of the Igf2 gene.  In the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated, which allows the CTCF protein to bind to the non-methylated ICR.  This bound protein acts as an insulator blocking the effect of the enhancers on the Igf2 gene.  The H19 gene is not methylated on the maternal allele.  As a result of this the maternal allele expresses the H19 gene while the Igf2 gene is silenced.  On the paternal gene the Igf2 gene is expressed and the H19 gene is silenced. </p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour the imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted by the additional methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele as well as the H19 promoter.  On both alleles the H19 gene is silenced and Igf2 gene is over expressed due to the enhancers acting on the Igf2 gene.  The over expression of Igf2 leads to Wilm’s tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic hallmark of cancer is a general overall hypomethylation of the genome with hypermethylation occurring at CpG islands associated with promoters.  In normal cells CpG islands tend to be hypomethylated.  Decitabine, a hypomethylation agent, is used to treat cancers and pre-cancers such as myelodysplastic syndrome.  Decitabine’s mechanism of action is as a cytosine analog.  The decitabine molecule acts to replace the natural cytosine molecule in dividing cells.  The substituted cytosine analog in the newly copied DNA strand stereochemically blocks the binding of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).  The blocking of DNMTs binding results in the new DNA strand being hypomethylated.  When the cell divides the new cell now has hypomethylation of important promoters sites needed for the re-expression of tumor suppressor genes, proper cell differentiation, stimulation of the immune mechanism and ultimately the suppression tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are a couple of ways that drugs that alter DNA methylation can have an effect that lasts beyond the period of drug treatment.  The first and most straightforward is that methylation patterns are inheritated from a somatic cell to its daughter cells.  As a result, a modified methylation pattern through treatment will continue through future somatic divisions and will continue to affect the patient.    </p>
<p>Enduring effects on the epigenome can result by altering DNA methylation during the sensitive periods of ebryogenesis and gametogenesis when methylation marks are being established.  Treating a woman during early pregnancy right after fertilization could have consequences that affect not just the woman, but also her child and potentially her grandchild if treatment is during the gametogenesis stage of development.  Treating a patient during the sensitive period when methylation marks are being established could change the necessary methylation marks needed for proper differentiation and development.</p></div>
