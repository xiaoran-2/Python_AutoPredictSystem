    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation</strong> consists in the addition of a methyl group (CH<sub>3</sub>) to DNA (double helix that encodes genetic information). In general, it occurs thank to methyltransferases on C nucleotides followed by G nucleotide. That's why it's called called CpG. They are usually clustered in island. Their methylation silences the gene expression as they are generally located at their promoter.</p>
<p>In cancer, DNA methylation at<strong> CpG islands</strong> is disrupted in cancer because they are hypermethylated  (cf. figure 1). It is in fact a set of genes that is concerned, especially the tumor suppressor genes. Thus, they will be silenced and will not be active against cancer.</p>
<p>Moreover, the DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease. For instance, it can lead to imprinted gene expression. That means it can activate or deactivate a gene, depending on the system of enhancers, and inhibitors and on their location in the imprint control regions (ICRs). This induces syndromes such as Beckwith Wiedeman syndrome, Prader Willi or Angelman syndromes.</p>
<p>In DNA, there are also <strong>intergenic regions </strong>and<strong> repetitive elements</strong>. These are usually methylated (cf. figure 1). Indeed, they have to be silenced in order to keep genomic integrity. These regions are not supposed to be expressed, because they are mutagenic (can induce deletion, insertion, reciprocal translocations).</p>
<p>In cancer, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted. Besides, they are hypomethylated, at genome-wide, increasing genomic instability. So, for example transposition, activation and recombination between repeats are induced, as activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease because it results in chromosomal instability and the number of mutations increases.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Disruption of imprinting</strong> can contribute to cancer. In fact, for example, H19/Igf2 cluster (in human chromosome11) at paternal allele, enhancers activate Igf2 thank to the methylated H19 gene (so which is inactivated). Indeed, methylation is spread downstream to the ICR, so that Igf2 is activated (figure2).</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, CTCF (insulator protein) binds ICR. Thus ICR will be unmethylated and H19 neither. So, unmethylated H19 is activated by enhancers and these are no more able to access Igf2. In this case, Ifg2 is inactive (figure2).</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Figure2</span> : H19/Igf2 cluster in paternal and maternal alleles</p>
<p>Wilm’s tumour (cancer of kidney), deals with imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted. It's caused by hypermethylation of ICR that provoke Igf2 overexpression. So, paternal and maternal allele are expressed (figure3)</p>
<p>Imprinted disorder at the H19/Igf2 cluster can induce loss of a tumour suppressor gene (Cdkn1c) or upregulation of Igf2 (growth promoting gene). So maternal allele can behave like paternal allele, contributing to disease or hypomethylated Igf2 at paternal allele is associated with obesity <span>leading to loss of imprinting and transcription of </span>Igf2.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As the article “<em>Cancer's epicentre</em>” in The Economist describes, there are several drugs that can affect epigenetic processes, such as <strong>Decitabine</strong>. Indeed, it is a hypomethylating agent; this means it is an inhibiting DNA methyltransferases.</p>
<p>As we already saw, methylation of DNA is an inactive epigenetic mark. So Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferases and it works like a reaction inhibitor (as a chemical analogue of the Cytosine) so that the enzyme (the DNA methyltransferase) binds to it instead of binding normally to the C nucleoside on DNA. That’s why Decitabine decreases the transfer of methyl group.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Decitabine removes methylation, like on the CpG islands, in cancer, at tumour suppressor genes. So thanks to this drug, we are now able to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. And in some people, by using a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine, the tumour growth slowed in advanced lung cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can be mitotically heritable so that the next generations can heritate these alterations.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period where the epigenome is instable, when epigenetic marks are actively remodelled.</p>
<p>Oocytes remain vulnerable during childhood in females, as epigenetic marks are not established in oocytes until puberty.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are globally:</p>
<p>-Primordial germ cell development (for production of matures gametes)</p>
<p>-Pre-implantation and early post-implantation.</p>
<p>Plus, the environment can trigger somatic changes in DNA methylation in adults.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it would be a danger to the offspring.</p>
<p>If a patient is treated with drugs such as Decitabine during sensitive periods, the primordial germ cells can be affected, so it would be transmitted to the next generation. Can induce a loss of a gene expression or its overexpression.</p></div>
