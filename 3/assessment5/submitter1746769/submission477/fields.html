    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually found in the promoters of the genes and play important role in regulation of genes. Generally, DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands causes gene silencing, while hypomethylation at CpG islands causes gene expression. In most instances, hypomethylation of CpG islands can be found in normal condition. In cancer, we can frequently find hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores in tumor suppressor genes. In minor cases, hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters result in activation of oncogenes, e.g. R-ras.The "epimutation" inactivates tumor suppressor genes or activates oncogenes, and can be one of the hit in the Knudson hypothesis, which postulates cancer is the multiple hits to DNA.</p>
<p>DNA is hypermethylated <span>in intergenic regions and repetitive element</span> in normal condition to prevent genomic instablility. By contrast, these regions in genome show DNA hypomethylation in cancer. It leads to genomic instability, such as illegimate recombination between repeat, activation of repeats and transposition, as well as activation of crypt promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes, and contribute to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The <em>Igf2</em> an <em>H19</em> are reciprocally imprinted genes. In normal cells, <em>Igf2</em> is paternally expressed and <em>H19</em> is maternally expressed. Their expressions are controlled by CTCF-dependent insulator. On the paternal allele, DNA methylation at imprinting control region (ICR) blocks binding of CTCF. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to<em> H19</em> promoter to silence, and enhancers can access<em> Igf2</em> to activate. On the maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated and CTCF can act as an insulator that prevent <em>Igf2</em> from accessing the enhancers. Thus enhancers can act on <em>H19</em> promoter to express the gene.</p>
<p>In Wilms' tumor, imprinting at <em>H19/Igf2 </em>cluster is disrupted. The ICR of maternal allele is hypermethylated, and results in <em>H19</em> silencing and <em>Igf2</em> activation. These alterations result in loss of expression of growth restriction gene (<em>H19</em>) and overexpression of growth promoting gene (<em>Igf2</em>), and lead to uncontrolled growth of tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a kind of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. It is a cytidine analog, which can incorporate into DNA. It can also irreversibly binds DNMTs and cause hypomethylation of DNA. Decitabine can induce anti-tumor effect by 2 mechanisms depending on the dose. At high dose, it leads to nonspecific toxic effect and causes tumor cell death. At low dose, it inhibits DNMTs and cause DNA hypomethylation, which may restore the functions of tumor suppressor genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation pattern is preserved during cell division, and can be transmitted to daughter cells and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Therefore altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. However, most epigenetic marks are cleared in sensitive periods. The sensitive periods includes periods of early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. Treating patients during sensitive periods may cause alteration of DNA methylation in germ cells or embryos, and is inadvisable.</p></div>
