    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell CpG islands, regions rich in CpG dimers at the promoter region of genes, are usually kept free from methylation and this is normally associated with the expression of the relevant gene. In cancer cells instead CGI are heavily methylated and this can be seen already during the initial phases of cancer. This hypermethylation in the promoter region of tumour suppressor genes is one of the hallmarks of cancer and causes the repression of transcription of these genes, allowing the abnormal growth of cancer cells. There is also strong evidence of hypermethylation at CGI shores, 2 Kb regions surrounding CpG islands, and this seems strongly correlated to gene silencing. Every tumour type shows a unique pattern of CGI hypermethylation and this pattern can also help with the prognosis and the choice of the most appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements instead are usually methylated in normal cells and this helps maintain the genomic integrity and stability of the cell, since methylation is normally associated with silencing. It is of paramount importance for the cell to suppress the activity of repetitive regions in order to avoid chromosomal instability and to silence strong promoters contained in repetitive elements, which are a major part of the genome. In cancer there is a genome-wide hypomethylation and thus repetitive elements can disrupt the stability of the genome, causing translocations, deletion and duplications of genes and general chromosomal rearrangements which are deleterious for the cell. Strong promoters present in transposons, which are no longer silenced, can activate abnormal transcription of genes and so lead to abnormal cell growth and contribute to general genomic instability.</p>
<p>In cancer cells there is a modified pattern of DNA methylation: a genome-wide hypomethylation, which causes instability due to reactivation of transposons and intergenic regions, which are usually kept silent, and hypermethylation of CGI present in promoters of tumour suppressor genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is the monoallelic parent-of-origin expression of a gene and the disruption of normal imprinting can lead to cancer. Imprinted genes are usually clustered together on chromosomes and are controlled by an Imprint Control Region which is differentially methylated in the paternal and the maternal allele. The activity of the <em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster is controlled by an ICR which is usually methylated in the paternal allele. In the maternal unmethylated allele the ICR is thus free to bind with an insulator called CTCF; this allows enhancers to bind to <em>H19</em> enhancing its expression, whereas the maternal copy of <em>Igf2</em> is silenced. The opposite happens on the paternal allele: the methylation of its ICR doesn't allow its binding with the insulator and so the enhancers are free to act on <em>Igf2</em>, which is thus paternally expressed, whereas there is silencing of <em>H19</em>.</p>
<p>This pattern is disrupted in Wilm's tumour where both ICRs are methylated, changing the normal balance of gene expression. So the maternal allele will no more express <em>H19</em> but it will behave like the paternal allele, thus expressing <em>Igf2. </em>This alters the equilibrium of the cell and there is an excess production of Igf2, a growth factor, leading to abnormal growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Contrary to genetic mutations, epigenetics alterations are reversible and thus susceptible to manipulation and there is a considerable interest in using molecules targeting epigenetic enzymes in order to fight cancer.</p>
<p>Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is a nucleoside analogue which acts as a DNMT inhibitor. This small molecule is incorporated into DNA during replication and binds DNMT which can thus no longer act to methylate CpG dimers, causing a progressive dilution of DNA methylation. This mode of action is replication dependant and Decitabine does not act specifically on cancer cells but since these cells do replicate more often than normal cells the inhibition of DNMT activity is particularly useful to stop proliferation of tumour cells. Decitabine is used against myleodysplastic syndromes and probably its efficacy is due to the fact that this tumour depends on hypermethylation of CpG islands.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a stable and heritable epigenetic mark which alters the way cells express their genome. Usually DNA methylation is associated with silencing (X chromosome inactivation in females) or imprinting but actually its action is context dependant and varies according to different situations. Thus every alteration to DNA methylation patterns can cause long term consequences.</p>
<p>There are two periods in the life of an organism which see a huge wave of genetic reprogramming, meaning the erasure of previous epigenetic marks and the resetting of new appropriate ones. These are: early embrionic development and primordial germ cells development. During these sensitive periods the epigenome undergoes a huge wave of erasure and resetting of various marks and this means that these periods are of crucial importance for the correct development of the organism. Every modification to epigenetic machinery can thus have serious consequences and can lead to long term disruptions. This means that epigenetic drugs tend to be used primarily in older patients, where future consequences are less important and the primary aims are survival and better life quality. The use of such drugs in younger patients could lead to alteration of their germ cells and thus have potential transgenerational effects,</p></div>
