    <h1>Submission 546 from Anon (session_user_id: 7aeab49a3aa2e3f2dbaaefe16a8b47ec1fd0a687)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- Epigenetic marks have the habit to be heritable during mitosis. So even after the therapy has been ended, the epigenetic methylation-marks will still be there and will be inherited by (all) daughter cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands are not methylated and when they are methylated, they silence the following genes.</p>
<p>However, in cancer they are more often hypermethylated, which means that these genes are more frequently silenced. This is important when the following genes are tumour supressor genes. When this is the case, the cell is far more likely to survive important mutations because they will not be detected/get the right response after detection.</p>
<p>Normally, most intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. These will mostly make sure that the genome is more strongly packaged (heterochromatin). When this is not the case (like in cancer), the regions will become more genetically unstable. This will result in crossing over, deletions and insertions. This will result in a general 'wrong' genome which has more chance of having too many proto-oncogenes or too few tumour supressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally unmethylated imprint control region on the maternal allele but because of this bound by CTCF, which in turn protects igf2 from downstream enhancers. These enhancers end up working on the H19region.</p>
<p>Methylated imprint control region on the paternal allele does exactly the opposite thing and ends up NOT insulating igf2 so the downstream enhancers can act on this gene.</p>
<p>In the Wilm's tumour, there is hypermethylation in the maternal allele on the imprint control region. This means igf2 will NOT be insulated on this allele and both the paternal as the maternal allele will produce igf2. This will lead to an overexpression of this gene and the consequent Wilm's tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent (in the course called: DNA-methyltransferase-inhibitors). It will get incorporated in the DNA during replication and when DNA-methyltransferase will come along, it will be covalently (permanently) bound to this enzyme. It will reduce the methylation-level of the DNA.</p>
<p>It will have an anti-tumour effect mostly on tumour cells that depend on heavy methylation of the DNA.</p></div>
