    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancerous cells have different DNA methylation profiles when compared to normal cells; the hypermethylation of CpG islands, and the hypomethylation of non-CpG cytosines.</p>
<p>CpG islands are located in the promoters of many genes, such as tumour suppressors. In a normal cell these CpG islands are unmethylated, and therefore the tumour suppressor gene products are expressed. In cancerous cells, the CpG islands are methylated, thus silencing the tumour suppressor genes. This may result in unrestricted growth (due to lack fo control over growth) and contribute to a cancerous phenotype. As the cancer phenotype worsens and develops, the amount of CpG methylation increases.<br /><br />The promoters of some genes can still be methylated, despite not containing CpG islands (ie cytosines that are not part of a CpG island). In a normal cell, non-CpG cytosine methylation is present for transposons and repetitive elements to prevent their movement and expression, as well as many other genes as part of tissue-specific silencing. In cancerous cells, non-CpG cytosine methylation is removed, thus activating the normally silenced genes. The activation of transposons and other repetitive elements leads to their movement throughout the genome, causing genome instability and possibly a cancerous phenotype through the insertional mutagenesis. The activation of otherwise normally silenced genes may also lead to a cancer, especially in the case of oncogenes.</p>
<p>Cancerous cells can be recognised by two main changes in DNA methylation. The hypermethylation of CpG islands will silence tumour supressing genes, and the hypomethylation of genome-wide non-CpG cytosines may lead to the activation of oncogenes, as well as transposons, leading to general genome instability.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting control regions (ICRs) are regulatory elements that control gene expression. Their silenced or active state is depended on the paternal or maternal origin of the allele. One example of an ICR is that controlling the H19/lgf2 cluster. Normally only the maternal allele is active; ie the paternal allele is silenced. This silencing effect is mediated by methylation at the ICR of the H19 promoter of the paternal allele. An alteration of such imprinting, has been shown to contribute to cancer, in the form of Wilm's tumour. If the maternal allele is silenced by hypermethylation, this results in no expression of the H19/lgf2 cluster (as the paternal allele is normally imprinted), and thus leading to a diseased state and a phenotype of Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an anti-cancer drug; a DNA demethylating agent. It helps treat cancer by targeting epigenetic marks associated with cancerous cells. As a DNA demethylating agent, Decitabine prevents the methylation of CpG islands, a common occurrence in cancer. CpG islands are often in the promoter region for tumour suppressor genes, and are hypermethylated in many, if not all cancers. Decitabine incorporates into newly synthesised DNA strands, inhibiting the action of DNA methyltransferase, and preventing the methylation of CpG islands. Thus Decitabine prevents tumour formation and maintenance, by activating the previously silenced tumour suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that inhibit DNA methyltranferases will have a prolonged effect, even after treatment is stopped. This is because there is a lag time between DNA methylation and DNA methyltransferase activity, coinciding with the time taken for DNA to replicate. For example after ~3 days, cells would have undergone 3 divisions, and thus 1/3 of cells would retain single-stranded methylation patterns. Such drugs should not be administered during the sensitive period; a period of germ cell development where epigenetic marks such as methylation and imprinting are reset. Treatment with such drugs during this period will interrupt the required imprinting of genes in gametes and will result in further complications for offspring.</p></div>
