    <div class="field-value"><p style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">In mammals, CpG islands are often associated with the promoter regions of genes. DNA methylation in these areas acts to silence gene expression. In a normal mammalian cell, most CpG islands are protected from methylation, with the exception of those that are involved in X chromosome inactivation.</p>
<p style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">In a cancer cell, CpG islands or island shores are often hypermethylated.</p>
<p style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">This can cause the silencing of tumor-suppressor genes, leading to uncontrolled cell growth that is the hallmark of cancer.<br /><br />Genome-wide, there are many areas of DNA that are outside of exons and therefore do not normally code for proteins – the repetitive elements and intergenic regions (introns). In a normal cell, one of the functions of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic stability – to prevent activation of repetitive and transposable elements and to prevent illegitimate recombination between repetitive elements during meiosis. Methylation also prevents activation of splice sites and cryptic promoters (in oncogenes) and the disruption of nearby genes. Methylation helps to maintain these regions in a heterochromatinized state so that it is not accessible by the genetic machinery of the cell.<br /><br />In a cancer cell, these regions of the genome are often hypomethylated. </p>
<p style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">In a cancer cell,the repetitive elements and intergenic regions can form illegitimate recombinations – chromosome insertions, deletions, and translocations. The chromatin structure becomes more open, and this euchromatin is more available for replication and transcription.These genomic regions can become activated, creating transposable elements and disrupting the actions of adjacent genes. In general, the genome becomes unstable and more prone to uncontrolled cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igh2 gene cluster is paternally imprinted. On the paternal allele, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated, which blocks binding of the insulator protein CTCF. Without CTCF to insulate the Igf2 gene from the downstream enhancers, Igf2 is activated and expressed from the paternal allele. In addition, spreading from the ICR methylates the H19 promoter, silencing it.<br /><br />On the maternal allele, the ICR is normally unmethylated. CTCR binds to the ICR and insulates Igf2 from the enhancers, silencing Igf2. Instead, the enhancers bind to the promoter of H19, activating it. As a result, a normal cell does not express Igf2 from the maternal allele.<br /><br />In Wilm’s tumor, the ICR on the maternal allele also becomes methylated.  The maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele, expressing Igf2.  With both alleles expressing the gene, the cells get an overdose of Igf2 expression.<br /><br />Because Igf2 is a growth-promoter (oncogene), this over-expression of Igf2 causes extraneous cell growth that results in the tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It inhibits the action of DNMT1.</p>
<p>DNMT1 is responsible for the mitotic heritability of methlylation marks by copying these marks to the daughter strand when DNA is being replicated as a part of cell division. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into the DNA strand. Then, when DNMT1 binds to the parent DNA strand, Decitabine binds to the DNMT1 and prevents its release. With less DNMT1 available after each cell division, further copying of the methylation marks is inhibited.</p>
<p>In a cancer cell, CpG islands are often hypermethylated. This can cause the silencing of tumor-suppressor genes, leading to the uncontrolled cell growth. By the action of Decitabine to prevent inheritance of the methylation marks in new cells, these genes will not be silenced, so the cells' tumor-suppression mechanism will work normally.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome by the action of DNMT, which copies the methylation marks to the daughter strand during the DNA replication phase of cell division. This makes the methylation marks mitotically inheritable. All descendents of the original cell will carry its methlylation marks.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods in the development of an organism are those during which the epigenetic marks are being reprogrammed.</p>
<p>In mammals, these are the pre-implantation period of early embryotic development (through the blastocyst stage) and during the development of the germline cells that will become the gametes.</p>
<p>Treatment during these period is inadvisable because changes to epigenetic marks during these periods could be transgenerationally inherited, possibly by incomplete clearing of the marks or via some messenger molecule, and because these effects are not well-understood.</p></div>
