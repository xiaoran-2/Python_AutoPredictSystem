    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are situated on the promoters of the genes, that are mostly expressed. They therefore tend to be unmehtylated (so as to allow transcription factors to bind to the promoters and eventually build a proteine). In cancer the CpG islands mostly of the tumour suppessor genes (the hypermethylation on cancer is locus specific) become methylated preventing those genes from transcription and therefore allowing the tumours to grow without control. On the contrast, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are usually highly methylated, because their expression can lead to genetic disruptions and their silencing is crucial for maintaining genomic stability.</p>
<p>In cancer both the repetitive elements and the intergenic regions become hypomethylated and therefore expressed, though it is the repetitive elements, that mostly contribute to cancer. What is also important is that this hypomethylation is genome0wide, which means that heterochromatin become open and is accessible for transcription factors. This can end up in reciprocal tarnslocations, because similar regions (repeptitive elements) can be aligned and then swaped. The repetitive elements also have an ability to copy themselves and pasting in another region, which results in gene disruption and also can activate the neighbouring genes, these can also end up in insertions and deletions. The itergenic regions contribute to the genomic instability, because its expression can disupt the transcription by simultaneous expression of two antisense genes, as well as lead to the illegetimate recombnations. All in all in cancer the DNA methylation on the regions, that should be expressed, is reduced leading to the loss of normal cell functions, while the regions, that need to be silenced for genomic integrity, are hypomethylated and therefore increase the disruption of genome in partuclar cells. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells the paternal allele is methylated, which prevents CTCF from binding to the ICR. Therefore CTCF can't prevent enhancers from access to the Igf2. Moreover the methylation on the ICR tends to spread onto following H19 locus and leads to its silencing. On the contrary, ICR on the maternal allel is normally unmethylated, which allows CTCF to bind and blocks in that way the access to Igf2 for the enhancers, so finally the H19 (on which the enhancers then act) is expressed. Therefore Igf2, which regulates growth, is normally expressed only from the paternal allele. In Wilm's tumour the methylation occurs on maternal allele at the ICR (due to the common for cancer locus specific hypermethylation). It allows Igf2 to be expressed from maternal allele as well (because the methylation on ICR prevents CTCF from binding and the enhacers promote Igf2 expression and the maternal allelle becomes identical to the paternal allele). It leads to the exaggerated amount of Igf2 and therefore to the predisposition to the childhood and embryonic tumours, partucularly to the Wilm's tumour (kidney tumour).   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitabine belongs to the class of Dnmt - inhibitors and so blocks this enzyme. Decitabine is similar to the 5-azacytidine (which is a analogue to the cytidine). The DNA-methyltransferase binds irreversebly to the cytidine analogue and can no longer be released. The absence of Dnmt in a cell reduces the density of methylation after the cell division. This process is then division dependent. As long as there is no Dnmt in the cell and therefore the post-replicational methylation of the new strands is no longer possible, the DNA will be passively demethylated. In low dosis this drug can have an anti-tumour effect, because it brings the epigenome to its normal state reducing the locus specific hypermethylation of promoters of tumour suppresor genes and thus affecting the tumour itself. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is passed from cell to cell by the following mechanism: when the cell divides, each of the daughter cells gets one strand, that was a part of their mother's double strand, while another one is the one that is newly built during replication. After the division all methylation marks, that are present on the already existed (in the mother cell) strand, are being copied on the new strand with the help of the DNMT1. The epigenome is in that way maintained during cell devision. However, the state of the epigenome can be altered during so-called sensitive periods, when the new methyaltion pattern is establishing and the epigenome is most sensitive to the environmental exposures. There are two main periods, during which  almost all DNA methylation is erased and then newly set:  early embryonic development and the primordial cell development. During those sensitive periods (i.e. children during puberty and women during pregnancy) it is not advisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs, because this 'environmental exposure' will affect the methylation pattern in an unpredictable way and those effects will be either maintained for the rest of life in case of early embryonic development, or passed to the following generations through altered germ cells.  </p></div>
