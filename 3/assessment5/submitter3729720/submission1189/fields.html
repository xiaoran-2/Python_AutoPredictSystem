    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are generally unmethylated, allowing for the expression of the genes near them. Hypermethylation of CpG islands is commonly found in cancer cells and they have the potential to be one of the hits in the knudson hypothesis, as cancer is theorized to be the result of multiple hits to DNA. CGI hypermethylation results in cancer by blocking the expression of tumor-suppressor genes. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, these epimutations are selected for by natural selection, considering the competitive advantage cancer cells hold over normal cells by being able to divide more rapidly. This causes the tumor to grow and even metastasize.</p>
<p>Intergenic intervals and repetitive elements are heavily methylated in normal cells. This happens to maintain genomic stability by preventing illegitimate recombinations between repeats, the activation of repeats and transpositions, and the activation of cryptic promoters. By being heavily methylated and heterochromatinized, recombination of repeats is avoided. It also stops deletions, additions, and reciprocal transpositions from happening. In cancer, however, these regions are generally hypomethylated, allowing for genomic instability. The genetic mutations this entails can cause cancer. </p>
<p>CpG island shores are regions 2 kb in size located next to CpG islands. Hypermethylation of these regions is also found in cancer and is linked to the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes as well. </p>
<p>From a molecular standpoint, methylation involves the addition of a methyl group. De-novo methyl transferases such as DNMT3a and DNMT3b set down these epigenetic marks at CpG islands. Inactive marks include H3K9me and H3K27me, and the latter is usually laid down by complexes such as PRC2. </p>
<p>In conclusion,the genome-wide loss of methylation and regional hypermethylation leads to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and the aberrant regulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes, thus leading to tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, DNMTi. Decitabine is used on patients who suffer from myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. At high doses, DNMTi becomes toxic to patients. If given at lower doses, however, there is an antineoplastic effect, reducing regional methylation at CpG islands. It is important to note Decitabine has a lack of specificity. </p>
<p>It is a nucleoside analogue, meaning it gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication, so that it irreversibly binds DNMTs when they attempt to copy the methylation unto the daughter strand. This irreversible binding is dependent upon replication, as it requires cell division to cause daughter cells to become demethylated.</p>
<p>Although these drugs are non-specific, they have a potent effect on cancer cells. That is probably due to the fact that cancer cells divide rapidly. The mechanism of action for these drugs remains unclear, though, and further studies are required.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation has enduring effects on the epigenome, as it is mitotically heritable, and it is laid down by DNMTs. When DNA replicates, it becomes hemi-methylated, as the daughter strands have no methylation. DNMT1 has an affinity for hemi-methylated DNA, adding methyl groups to the daughter strand. If the methylation of the parent cell is altered, this alteration will be passed onto its future daughter cells.  <br />A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming. This is when methylation is removed from cells and added again. There are two sensitive periods. The first is in early embryonic development, while the second occurs during primordial germ cell development. Treating patients during these sensitive periods can have long-lasting effects. These drugs are used throughout the system, meaning all cells can be affected. When these drugs inhibit epigenetic machinery, they can affect primordial germ cells during their reprogramming and development. Changes to DNA methylation in germ cells can be passed on to offspring, leading to potentially dangerous conditions. This is also found in early embryonic development, and changes to the embryo can be passed on to all future cells. Scientific studies show that changes in methylation to genes such as IGF2, GNAS, and MEG found in imprint control regions leads to a higher propensity for diseases. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. CTCF, an insulator protein, binds to the maternal allele's unmethylated imprint control region. This insulates Igf2 from the enhancers located downstream. On the other hand, the methylation of the imprint control region in the paternal allele prevents CTCF from binding, thus allowing the enhancers to reach the Igf2 gene and promote its expression.Should both alleles be methylated at the imprint control region (thus behaving like the paternal allele) there will be an overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth promoting oncogene.</p>
<p>This upregulation can be caused by a number of reasons. Genetic mutations occuring within this region can cause the loss of imprinting. Also, uniparental disomy can occur, which is when both copies of an allele is inherited from one parent. In this case, both alleles may have been inherited from the father. Epigenetic problems with laying down the methylation can be a cause as well, but this is rare.</p>
<p>This disruption to the H19/Igf2 cluster leads to Beckwith Weidemenn syndrome, which is associated with the formation of Wilm's tumor, a childhood cancer located in the kidney.  </p></div>
