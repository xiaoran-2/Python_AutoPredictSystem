    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation at CpG islands is usually synonymous with silencing of the gene. A normal cell would display acetylation at the CpG island which allows espression of the gene and methylation of the intergenic region and repetitive elements. In cancer the CpG island displays hypermethylation which silences the gene. In many cancers genes that normally act to suppress tumouregenesis are silenced and genes responsible for cell proliferation which in the adult are normally silenced, become expressible.</p>
<p>Methylation of gene body intergenic intervals and repetitive elements is associated with highly expressed genes and may assist in maintaining genomic stability allowing uninterrupted expression of the gene by repressing "transcriptional noise" and inhibiting possible "antisnse transcription". </p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation of CpG islands, intergenic intervals and repetitive elements are all contributary factors in genomic wide instability. CpG island methylation is highly mitotically heritable, therefore unless the disruption is reversed, genomic instability will spread. Instability of intergenic intervals and repetitive elements may lead to deletions, insertions and/or translocations of genes within the chromosone. The degree of instability and the extent of the cellualar landscape affected will determine the nature and severity of disease expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the paternal allele is imprinted and therefore methylated at the imprinted region and H19 promoter allowing the enhancers, through chromatin looping to directly cause Igf2 expression. The maternal allele is not so methylated and therefore Igf2 is not expressed. On the maternal allele the unmethylated imprinted region is bound by CTCF which acts as an insulator blocking chromatin looping to Igf2. That looping then jumps to H19 to express the lncRNA thought to be an RNA reservoir.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour Igf2 is overexpressed. Igf2 is an oncogene and should be repressed/silenced in the adult. Its overexpression leads to tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor class of drugs and is a nucleoside analogue. They act as DNA demethylation agents specifaclly at the time of cell division. Because the genomic disruption is causing cell to divide more rapidly than they should, the action of this drug slows the progression of the cancer, in particular myelodysplastic syndrome which is synonymous with heavy CpG island hypermethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because altering DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the epigentic mutation is "bred out" unlike other forms of cancer treatments that focus on killing all abherent cells. This form of treatment is relatively new and therefore its long term affects are as yet unknown. The drugs are also thought to be non specfic in their action and may affect DNA methylation that is normal. Generally they are being used in older adults and more specifaclly those for whom other forms of treatment have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>For this reason these drugs are not appropriate for use in children. Whilst in the growth cycle rapid cell division is necessary. When a particular growth path has been completed alterations are made to the DNA such chromatin remodelling, CpG island methylation, silent regions etc so that the cell can function properly. Use of drug classes such as DNMTi and HDACi's could have a disasterous long term impact on the genome of the individual. </p></div>
