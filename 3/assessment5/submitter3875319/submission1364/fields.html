    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the principal characteristics of cancerous cells is the difference in both quantity and location of DNA methylation compared with non-cancerous cells. DNA methylation involves addition of a methyl(CH3) group to a cytosine(C) nucleotide and in mammals occurs mainly at CpG nucleosides (cytosine linked to guanine(G) via a phosphate bond) and is principally involved with gene silencing. CpG density is high at CpG islands, locations of gene promoters where transcription factors bind. Despite this, methylation of CpG islands in non-cancerous cells is low and is associated with processes such as X-chromosome inactivation and imprinting. In cancerous cells there is often hypermethylation of CpG islands and nearby ‘island shores’, with subsequent epigenetic silencing of tumour suppressing genes owing to DNA methylation being mitotically heritable. Also by silencing tumour suppressors, such as RB and BRCA1 in retinoblastoma and breast cancer respectively, cancer cells gain a competitive edge over non-cancerous cells and are able to divide more rapidly and live longer and thus proliferate to the detriment of non-cancerous cells.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is abundant at intergenic regions and serves to maintain genomic integrity. Cells without the maintenance methyltransferase enzyme DNMT1 lose genomic integrity. Additionally DNA methylation silences cryptic promoters whose RNApolymerase2-loaded promoters could seriously interfere with genuine gene promoters.  Repetitive elements function mutagenically to ‘copy and paste’ or ‘cut and paste’ into other locations. DNA methylation of repetitive elements prevents mutagenic transposition by silencing the promoters of the structural protein ‘gag’ and transcriptional protein ‘pol’. Cancerous cells show hypomethylation of intergenic and repetitive elements compared to non-cancerous cells and this lack of methylation pushes chromatin into a euchromatin/open state rather than being in heterochromatin/closed form. This can lead to activation of cryptic promoters, inappropriate transposition of repeats into gene coding regions and illegitimate recombinations between repeats. Such aberrant functioning in cancer cells results in chromosomal deletions, insertions, duplications and translocations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer formation one such example being when the two parental alleles of the H19/Igf2 cluster are not differentially methylated. DNA methylation does not necessarily correlate with gene expression silencing in imprinting control regions(ICRs) rather it determines whether or not genes are maternally or paternally imprinted. The H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted genes is located on chromosome 11. Igf2 is an oncogene or growth promoter separated from the long non-coding RNA H19 by an ICR. On the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated enabling binding of an insulator protein called CTCF which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. The ICR on the paternal allele is methylated and blocks CTCF binding causing the spread of DNA methylation into the H19 promoter region thus silencing it and allowing downstream enhancers to activate Igf2. If hypermethylation occurs such that the maternal ICR is methylated then genes cease to exhibit monoallelic parent of origin specific expression. CTCF binding does not occur  and the preferred chromatin loop of enhancer to Igf2 is followed rather than the maternal secondary loop of enhancer to H19 which has been silenced.  Over-expression of the oncogene Igf2 can lead to a specific childhood kidney tumour called Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic alterations are reversible. Decitabine is a US FDA approved DNA methyltransferase(DNMT) inhibitor used in myelodysplastic syndromes progressing to acute myeloid leukaemia. It is a nucleoside analogue which targets an enzymatic epigenetic regulator and is incorporated into DNA upon replication, irreversibly binding DNMT. Cells need to be in the process of replication for the drug to take effect hence DNA methylation as an epigenetic marker is no longer available to subsequent daughter strands. Decitabine is a non-selective drug and although all cells undergoing division are potentially susceptible to the action of Decitabine, the replication rate for cancerous cells far exceeds that of non-cancerous cells thus the dose required is extremely low. Non-cancerous cells appear to be susceptible only at very high dosage and the majority of users have experienced few side effects. Although its absolute mechanism remains unclear Decitabine seems particularly effective because it targets CpG island hypermethylation a classic indicator of poor prognosis in haematological malignancies.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer resulting in genome-wide hypomethylation coupled with tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation. DNA methylation inhibition drugs could promote tumour suppressors silenced by DNA methylation at CpG islands but such drugs could be deleterious at intergenic regions and repetitive elements which tend to be hypomethylated in cancer cells. However additional demethylation of already hypomethylated regions could alter even more chromatin structure and nuclear architecture thus making the cancer more accessible to chemotherapy drugs which might explain the delayed response observed by Dr Stephen Baylin. Sensitive periods occur when epigenetic markers are removed through DNA demethylation. The principal early sensitive periods occur at the pre-implantation of the fertilised egg to early post-implantation blastocyst stage and mid-embryonic primordial germ cell to gamete stage. Throughout gestation as individual organs form, further sensitive periods can occur. The Overkalix data showed that sensitive periods also occur at the pre-pubescent stage for all children and additionally the foetal/infant stage for girls. As DNA demethylation is already occurring during sensitive periods, treating patients then would cause DNA demethylation of imprinted genes and repeats and could have an adverse transgenerational effect upon patients’ future children and grandchildren.</p>
