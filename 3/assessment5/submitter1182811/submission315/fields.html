    <div class="field-value"><h2><strong>DNA Methylation in cancer:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands: </strong>In the normal cell , the CpG island is hypomethylated. So, we don’t find see methylation at the cpG islands. In general,CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. So , cell behaves quite normally in this case.</p>
<p><strong>DNA methylation of CpG islands in cancer cell: </strong>In case of cancer cell , the CpG islands are hypermethylated. Since, CpG islands are found in promoters of tumor suppressor genes and since DNA mythlation is mitotically heritable, there is a good locking down mechanism of epigenetic silencing the tumor suppressor gene.</p>
<p><strong>Contribution of disease due to disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands: </strong>Because of the hypermythlation of CpG islands in case of cancer cell which silences the tumor suppressor geneepigenetically by locking in acyl in active state.So, this the way that a cancer cell is able to inactivate tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p><strong>Normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements: </strong>In the normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are Hypermethylated maintain genomic stability and normal karyotype.</p>
<p><strong>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer: </strong>In case of cancer cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are Hypomethylated causing genomic instability<strong> .</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Contribution of disease due to disruption of DNA methylation <strong>in intergenic regions and repetitive elements: </strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>Due to the hypomethylation in the intergenic and repetitive elements causing illegitimate recombination between repeats,activation repeats &amp; transposition giving raise to abnormal karyotype like deletion, reciprocal translocation &amp; insertions.Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><h2><strong>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have long lasting effect</strong></h2>
<p><strong><span>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome: </span></strong>cells adapt to more permanent changes and modiﬁcations to DNA methylation and chromatin structure, leading to enduring alteration of a specific epigenetic network. So, any epigenetic effect caused by a drug may persist even after the drug is discontinued.</p>
<p><strong>Definition of sensitive period. :</strong> sensitive periods  are those when the environment or external condition may be able to influence epigenetic makeup,active remodelling of the epigenome. </p>
<p><strong>sensitive periods of development</strong>: Period of primordial germ celldevelopment all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms is one sensitive period. The second sensitive period is the pre implanted and early post implantation period. </p>
<p><strong>why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable: </strong>When administered with drug , drug goes throughout the system until every cell has potential to be effected by these drugs.So maybe still need to keep in mind that younger patients, particularly those that have developing germ cells for example in sensitive periods.To be cautious about sensitive period so that one very large insult to the environment would be taking a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><h2><strong>Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Methylation pattern of the paternal allele &amp; Igf2 expression : </strong>The imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele. Because this is methylated, now the enhancers can act on lgf2 because CTCF is not binding and lgf2 is expressed from the pattern allele. </p>
<p><strong>Methylation pattern of the maternal allele &amp;  Igf2 expression: T</strong>he imprint control region is unmethylated on the maternal allele.CTCF 4 bind is an insulator element, and it means that the enhancers in this case will act on H19.But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele and lgf2 is not expressed. </p>
<p><strong>Disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster in Wilm’s tumour:  </strong>With loss of imprinting causes a high permethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele andlgf2 is expressed.So there is a double dose of lgf2 in comparison to what is observed in a normal cell.</p>
<p><strong>Contribution of disease by disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster: </strong>There is a double dose of lgf2 . Since lgf2 is growth promoting and causing the tumor . This is called Wilm's tumour observed in childhood kidney genome. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><h2><strong>Decitabine to treat cancer</strong></h2>
<p><strong>class of epigenetic inhibitors of Decitabine:</strong> Decitabine belongs to DNMT(DNA methyltransferase) inhibitor FDA approved and used in Myelodysplastic syndrome progressed to AML.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation ;</strong> Decitabine acts similar to 5-azacytidine, which inhibits DNA methyltransferase. The action of these DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent so you have to have the cell replicating.</p>
<p><strong>How Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect :</strong> cancer cells which are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body will be more severely affected because they're replicating more.So they get incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then, when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, the DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. </p>
