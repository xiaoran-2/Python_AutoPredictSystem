    <h1>Submission 989 from Anon (session_user_id: 1059806994b7312e845f0ce7b34d5c4e52d706a1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to is DNA-demethylating agents.</p>
<p>Decitabine affects DNA methylation by demethylating the DNA so that the genes on the DNA will not be silenced.</p>
<p>Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect by demethylating the tumor-suppressor genes so that the tumor-suppressor genes can do their job of stopping the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The genes at CpG islands in a normal cell are usually not methylated. The function of DNA methylation is regulating many cellular processes, including embryonic development, transcription, genomic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, chromatin structure, and chromosome stability.</p>
<p>Promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated in cancer cells, which will cause the silencing of the underlying gene.</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands will cause the silencing of the tumor-suppressor genes, and since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, it will then be able to lock down the silencing genes.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is silencing the genes and maintaining stability in the genome.</p>
<p>In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypomethylated.</p>
<p>DNA hypomethylation will cause genomic instability in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, including activation of repeats and transpositions, illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes, etc.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic changes are passed on to daughter and granddaughter cells during cell division until they are actively erased.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are easily altered due to the exposure to chemical elements, changes in the environment, diet, etc.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development include early embryonic and germ cells development. Younger children may also be affected.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because epigenetic marks are transmitted from parents to offspring.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the imprint control region of the paternal allele is methylated; therefore, the enhancers can act on Igf2, so that Igf2 can be expressed.</p>
<p>In normal cells, the imprint control region of the maternal allele is unmethylated; therefore, CTCF binds the insulator element and the enhancers will act on H19, but Igf2 will be silenced.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, the imprinting control region of the maternal allele will also be methylated; therefore, Igf2 will also be expressed.</p>
<p>When Igf2 of both the paternal and maternal allele is expressed, it will produce double dose of Igf2 compared to the normal cells, which is overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p></div>
