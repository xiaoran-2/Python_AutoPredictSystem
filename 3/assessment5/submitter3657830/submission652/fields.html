    <div class="field-value"><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism in which, through the addition of a methyl group, gene expression is affected. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA methylation usually results in gene silencing, however, regions known as CpG islands within gene promoters usually remain unmethylated regardless of their activity state. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In cancer, however, the typical pattern of DNA methylation is altered, with hypermethylation often occurring at CpG islands in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, causing a permanent silencing of the underlying gene as methylation marks are mitotically heritable.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">This serves to inactivate tumor suppressor cells, leading to the development and progression of cancer (as CpG island hypermethylation increases over time).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">More recently, it has also been shown that hypermethylation can spread to the regions surrounding CpG islands, known as CpG shores.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">While typically unmethylated locus-specific CpG islands show hypermethylation in cancer, global (or genome-wide) hypomethylation is also seen – most commonly in repetitive elements and intergenic intervals which are usually methylated to function normally.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">As a result, genomic instability often ensues as chromatin becomes less densely packaged, and more susceptible to mutations including illegitimate recombination of repeats (insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocations), activation and transposition of repeats, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Less frequently, CpG poor promoters (regions of low CpG density) also show hypomethylation, leading to cancer via processes such as the silencing of tumour supressors via microRNA activation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Alterations in DNA methylation, both hyper- and hypo-, can also occur at Imprint Control Regions, resulting in a loss of genetic imprinting, thus inactivating growth restricting hormones or creating an overexpression of growth promoting genes. <br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Generally, epigenetic DNA methylation changes are more often seen in cancer than genetic mutations. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Often in cancer, DNA methylation patterns change at imprint control regions. This can involve either hyper or hypomethylation causing a disruption in genetic imprinting.</p>
<p>Genes that normally display monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression – or genetically imprinted – become either expressed or silent on both parental alleles.</p>
<p>An example of hypermethylation of an imprint control region is seen within the H19/igf2 gene cluster.</p>
<p>Normally in this cluster, we find methylation on the paternal allele, while the maternal allele remains unmethylated.</p>
<p>In its unmethylated state on the maternal allele, the transcription repressor CTCF binds to an insulator element, allowing enhancers to act on the tumour suppressor H19. As a result, the human insulin-Igf2 region will be silent.</p>
<p>On the methylated paternal allele, CTCF is not bound, and as such, enhancers can act directly on igf2, allowing it to be expressed.</p>
<p>However, when hypermethylation occurs, the maternal allele also becomes methylated and it now expresses igf2 along with the paternal allele.</p>
<p>With this overexpression of the growth promoting igf2, a scenario is set up for the development of Wilm's tumour, a cancer of the kidneys that typically occurs in children.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Speculation surrounds the potential importance of epigenetic drugs suggesting they may have the ability to alter cancer cells in such a way that their efficacy continues even after therapy has ceased.</span></p>
<p><span>According to The Economist, support for this theory mounted following research by Dr Stephen Baylin, who used a combination of epigenetic drugs to slow tumour growth in advanced lung cancer. </span></p>
<p><span>As well as being the first documented success of epigenetic drugs in treating solid tumours, individuals who did not respond initially then reacted well to the routine chemotherapy that followed.</span></p>
<p><span>The reasons for this success may lie in the fact that epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division until they are actively erased. </span></p>
<p><span>However, despite these encouraging signs, caution remains, as epigenetic drugs operate system-wide and all cells have the potential to be effected. This is pertinent when it comes to younger patients whose germ cells are still developing – during so-called sensitive periods.</span></p>
<p><span>Introducing an epigenetic drug during a sensitive period would constitute a very large insult and may have significant implications.</span></p>
<p><span>While keeping these factors in mind, it appears that the outlook is encouraging for targeting epigenetic processes in cancer with drug therapy.</span></p>

    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value"><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoNormal">While it is well-documented that cancer is a genetic disease, epigenetic research </span><span>is allowing better understanding of the underlying chemical processes that regulate genetic activity.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Some of this epigenetic machinery is implicit in the development and progression of cancer and due to its chemical nature, it is very open to drug therapy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In the case of DNA hypermethylation, often found in cancer, DNA-demethylating agents such as decitabine are already in use.</span><strong></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Decitabine is </span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">used in a number of countries to treat myelodysplastic syndromes – cancers of the blood – that have progressed to acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that is incorporated permanently and irreversibly into the DNA upon replication.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">As cancer cells in tumours divide much more rapidly than normal cells, they will be more severely affected.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Drugs such as decitabine appear to be paving the way for targeting the epigenetic machinery in cancer.</span></p></div>
