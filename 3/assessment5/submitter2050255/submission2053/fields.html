    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an addition of a methyl group to the DNA which happens at one of the nitrogenous bases called cytosines and is essential during the embryonic development of mammals. CpG islands are not normally methylated, so the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence the genome. Many human diseases have been correlated to hypermethylation and hypomethylation, two aberrant DNA methylation patterns. Hypermethylation usually takes place in the promoter area of tumour suppressor genes at CpG islands, is related to gene activation, thereby silencing the genes in human tumours. This is in part because DNA methylation changes gene expression in cells while they divide. This enables a single cell to multiply rapidly. This could be why DNA methylation plays such a vital role in nearly all types of cancer and also many diseases. Hypomethylation has been blamed for the progression of cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic intervals and the repetitive elements are areas where you find genes to be methylated. This is because DNA is mutagenic and can increase the frequency of mutation.  It is believed that the purpose of methylation at intergenic regions is to ensure genomic integrity. It’s not exactly silencing, but keeps it stabile so as to avoid things like deletion, duplication and translocation. Repetitive elements are different. Whereas most gene sequences are unique, repetitive elements, also called repeated sequence DNA, have multiple copies. DNA methylation at repetitive elements silences these repetitive elements. This happens to block mutagenic transposition and avoid transcriptional interference. DNA methylation in cancer is not like normal cells. There are massive changes which are considered the hallmark of cancer, since every cancer studied has aberrant DNA methylation. However, in cancer these intergenic intervals and their repetitive elements are often unmethylated. It is thought that DNA methylation in cancer is hypomethylation at the intergenic intervals, and that the repetitive elements promote this lack of genomic integrity we often see in cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Allele specific expression is based on the parent-of-origin. If the one allele is expressed, the other is silenced. For example if the methylation pattern of the paternal allele is methylated, it’s paternally imprinted. If the maternal allele is unmethylated and the paternal allele is methylated, the imprinted control region is paternally imprinted, and CTCF (an insulator protein) cannot bind. That means the enhancers are free to act on lgf2 and promote lgf2’s expression from only the paternal allele. The maternal allele will not be expressed. <br />In the Beckwith Wiedeman Syndrome, the maternal allele acts like a paternal allele. Two paternal alleles causes abnormalities such as the loss of imprinting and upregulation of lgf2 which promotes oncological overgrowth. This in turn can cause a predisposition to embryonic/childhood tumours, as in for example Wilm’s Tumour which affects the kidneys. The loss of imprinting is highly prevalent in many diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are several drugs that influence epigenetic processes. GSK2816126, for one, is an inhibitor that showed great promise during research. Histone overmethylation fell drastically, the propagation of tumour cells were reduced, and most importantly, it did not damage surrounding cells. Also, the cells were altered in a way, that they became more susceptible to chemotherapy. But unfortunately, GSK2816126 is not ready for human consumtion. However, there are some epigenetic inhibitors, such as Decitabine which is a DNA-demethylating agent, that are being sold now. Dectabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor used to treat myeodysplastic syndromes, which is an especially vicious form of leukaemia.  <br /><br />What makes these drugs unique is that, as opposed to other gene regulation methods, these epigenetic changes are passed on to future cells by cell division, until they are effectively deleted. Once gone, they do not return, which is truly amazing since this could mean that cancer cells could be destroyed without destroying the surrounding tissue.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have a lasting effect on the epigenome by effectively changing the the cells in the daughter and granddaughter cells, thus eliminating the disease/cancer/tumour forever, without harming the cells.</p>
<p>There are two periods of development where it would be best to refrain from administering such altering drugs: the primordial germ cell development and early development. These are two very sensitive periods for several reasons. Epigenetic reprogramming done during primordial germ cell development effect the imprinted gene, which always need to preserve their level of DNA methylation so the paternal origin specific way could be altered. During early development treatment could deteriorate DNA methylation imprints at the imprint control regions. In both cases, if you don’t have the proper expression of maternal proteins, they cannot protect the implant control regions. </p>
