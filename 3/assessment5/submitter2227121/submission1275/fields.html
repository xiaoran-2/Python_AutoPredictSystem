    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are portions of DNA genomic regions that contain a high frequency of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site">CpG sites</a>., where C and the G linked  beside one another.  CpG islands are often found in promotor regions, are associated with gene silencing, and are most typically unmethylated. However, when the CpGs in these promoter areas become hypermethylated, this is associated with cancer. This is because hypermethylation impairs the gene that is under the influence of that promoter. So, the consequence of hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands is the disabling (ie, silencing) of tumor suppressor genes that are typically repressed by the unmethylated CpG regions. This then sets the stage for the emergence of cancer.</p>
<p> intergenic regions and repetitive sequences and are most often methylated. In cancer, there is a disruption of the methylation at these repetitive sequences, and this causes genomic instability and raises the potential for mutagenesis that may result in formation of tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is an epigenetic process that affects gene expression and can be inherited, like an acquired characteristic. Genomic imprinting may involve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation">DNA methylation</a> and modification of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_methylation">histone</a>s. The result is that although the genes themselves are not altered, they may repressed or silenced in on chromosome (maternal or paternal), so that the alternate allele is expressed in the individual as if the trait were monoallelic.</p>
<p>The H19/ Igf2 cluster is an imprint control region found on human chromosome 11. It serves as an ENHANCER BLOCKER. Imprinted alleles are silenced, so that the genes are either expressed <strong>only</strong> from the non-imprinted allele inherited from the mother or from the non-imprinted allele inherited from the father. H19 is an example of a gene inherited maternally; Igf2 is inherited paternally.  When there is enhanced expression of Igf2, it promotes tumorigenesis, and predisposes the individual to several syndromes, including Wilm’s tumor.  Hence disease can result from a failure of normal imprinting, with the expression of genese that would otherwise be silenced or nonenhanced,and tumor suppression compromised. Wilm’s is a kidney -related condition malignancy that is the result of the LOSS of imprinting in this cluster.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent  that silences tumour suppressor genes by inhibiting the enzyme <em>DNMTDNA Methyltransferase</em>.</p>
<p>A source of the problem in cancer may be overactive enzymes that attach methyl groups to histone proteins (ie. DNMT!), which  could result in silencing of nearby genes. If the silenced genes are tumor suppressors, the stage is set for cancer.</p>
<p>Normally, <em>DNMT catalyzes the methylation of DNA; when inhibited, DNA is hypomethylated. When incorporated into the DNA of a cancer cell that is prone to rapid uncontrolled proliferation, it disrupts the cells ability to undergo division. </em>In human cancer cells, DNMT is responsible for methylation (hence, silencing) of tumor suppressor genes. Therefore, a goal of therapy is to de-repress the silencing, allowing tumors to be suppressed, and thus preventing the proliferation of cancers. This is the intended effect of Decitabine: to inhibit the activity of the DNMT via targeted hypomethylation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>“Sensitive period” refers to the period when environment has profound influence on the epigenetic characteristics of the individual. These susceptible periods are when the epigenome is actively remodeled via the removal and  re-establishment of epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>These periods are during gametogenesis (between primordial germ cell formation and their maturation) and, pre- and post-impantation periods in early embryogenesis.</p>
<p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation could have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic modifications are transmitted during cell division to progeny cells and remain in place until they are actively removed. So, epigenetic therapies could inhibit cancer cells in a way that becomes incorporated into that cell line’s epigenome. This would be a lasting mark conferred by the drug, without having to continue administering the drug. It would target malignant cells, keeping them at bay or making them more susceptible to other drugs thus relieving the problem of resistance to chemotherapies over the long term and in cases of relapse.</p>
<div>
<p>This persistence is also why agents that modify these epigenetic characteristics should be avoided during the sensitive periods, since they could confer heritable and propagable changes to all cells. Drugs that inhibit the success of cancer cells would then confer a transmissible alteration on all cells, which is not the goal of the exercise.</p>
