    <div class="field-value"><p>The function of DNA methylation is intrinsically linked to the mechanism for establishing, maintaining and removing the methyl group. DNA methylation is a mediator of long-term silencing and contributes to the regulatory mechanisms of tissue-specific gene expression in normal cellsCpG islands are resistant to de novo methylation in normal cells. However, the faithful maintenance of normal DNA methylation patterns is disrupted in cancer, where CpG islands bebecome susceptible to methyltransferase activity and CpG poor regions undergo hypomethylation during transformation. Consistent with this, the overall level of genomic 5-methylcytosine is decreased in cancer cells. Hypomethylation of bulk cellular DNA might result in genomic and chromosomal instabilityand is perhaps suggestive of a global switch mechanism that directs changes in chromatin structure concomitant with aberrations in DNA methylation patterns. The change in DNA methylation patterns is considered to be common in most cancers, with significant effects on gene expression patterns, cellular growth, and selective advantage. These changes can be the result of silencing of tumor suppressor genes and alterations to associated downstream pathways such as repression of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway</p></div>

answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

In Wilms tumour, biallelic expression of <em>IGF2</em> has been observed in association with loss of methylation at a DMR in <em>IGF2.</em> This DMR, known as DMR0, has been shown to be methylated on the silent maternal <em>IGF2</em> allele presumably with a role in repression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine) is a unique cytosine analog that inhibits DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), reverses methylation and can reactivate silenced genes<span>.</span>Preclinical studies have suggested that the cytidine analog, decitabine can work as a DNMT inhibitor to reverse DNA methylation and induce differentiation and apoptosis in cancer cells. Decitabine is modified at the 5′ position, where the methyl group is usually attached. Intracellularly, decitabine is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase, and its end product, decitabine triphosphate, is incorporated into DNA. Incorporation of a high concentration of decitabine triphosphate into DNA can inhibit DNA synthesis and induce cell cycle arrest. On the other hand, low concentration of decitabine, incorporated into DNA in place of cytosine, can covalently trap DNA methyltransferases, which eventually causes degradation of DNMT without cell cycle arrest. DNA replication in the absence of DNMTs then leads to global and gene specific hypomethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

The study </span>implying that the demethylating drugs had produced a “memory” antitumor response. Dr. Baylin believes that these new findings suggest that low-dose azacitidine and decitabine may be of benefit in multiple cancers. He also presented updated results from an early-phase trial (initially <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/111511/page8#b">reported last year</a>) of low-dose azacitidine combined with <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/drugdictionary?CdrID=38294">entinostat</a>, another epigenetic drug, for patients with advanced lung cancer. Several patients have had strong tumor responses, he reported, some of which continued even after treatment was stopped. A number of patients in the trial, many of whom had already received multiple prior therapies, “are going on to subsequent therapies,” Dr. Baylin said, “and we have started to see some very robust responses.” For example, four patients with advanced lung cancer who participated in the azacitidine/entinostat trial at Johns Hopkins went on to receive one of two investigational immunotherapy drugs called anti-PD1 and <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/drugdictionary?cdrid=612730">anti-PD-L1</a>. Both drugs target molecules involved in blocking immune responses to tumors.</p>
