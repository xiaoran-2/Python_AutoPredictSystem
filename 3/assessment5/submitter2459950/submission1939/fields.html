    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells, DNA may be hypermethylated or hypomethylated compared to normal cells.  These aberrant methylation changes are often locus-specific/context-dependent and occur at different times during tumorigenesis.  They may involve parts of individual genes, such as CpG island (CGI) promoters, or megabases, as in LRES (silencing) or LREA (activation).  CGIs are not usually methylated in normal cells.  This allows CGI-containing promoters of tumor suppressor genes to be transcribed, protecting the cell from neoplastic changes.  In cancer, CGIs are hypermethylated, silencing genes that prevent cancer (e.g., tumor suppressor genes).  CGI hypermethylation may be one "hit" that leads to cancer (multi-hit Knudson hypothesis).  Importantly, DNA hypermethylation changes are mitotically heritable and epimutations are rapidly selected, so methylation alterations are passed on with each cell division.  Disruption of DNA methylation at CGIs contributes to disease by silencing genes that protect cells from tumorigenesis.  The inactivation of tumor suppressor genes increases the probability that a cell will undergo carcinogenesis.  Single genes with CGI hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes in cancer include hypermethylation of the <em>RB </em>gene (retinoblastoma), <em>BRCA1 </em> (breast), <em>MLH1 </em>(CRC), and <em>MGMT </em>(gliomas, CRC).  Sets of genes may also be hypermethylated, as in CRC CIMP (CGI hypermethylation phenotype) and CGI shores.  The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to suppress these genes via methylation leading to heterochromatinization and genomic stability.  In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated, leading to open chromatin (euchromatin), aberrant copying, and genomic instability.  Hypomethylation occurs early in tumorigenesis and progresses over time.  DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions/repetitive elements contributes to disease by increasing the probability of carcinogenesis as a result of genomic instability leading to illegitimate recombinations via reciprocal translocations, deletions, and insertions, or, with hypomethylation of CpG-poor promoters, oncogene activation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is the expression of one inherited parental allele (e.g., maternal) and the silencing of the other (e.g., paternal).  Imprinting involves about 150 genes and leads to mono-allelic expression.  Imprinted epigenetic marks are maintained through embryogenesis (not PGC development).  Imprinting is controlled by DNA methylation at the Imprint Control Region (ICR).  The ICR of the <em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster of the paternal allele is methylated, suppressing <em>H19</em> expression and allowing downstream Enhancers to express <em>Igf2 </em>(Insulin-like growth factor-2) from the paternal allele.  Normally, the ICR of the maternal allele is not methylated, leading to CTCF (a protein insulator) binding to the ICR, Enhancer-associated expression of <em>H19</em>, and silencing of <em>Igf2</em>.  In Wilm's tumor, the ICR of the maternal allele is methylated, like the paternal allele ICR, leading to suppression of <em>H19</em>, expression of <em>Igf2</em>, and therefore "double dose" bi-allelic expression of <em>Igf2</em>.  Disruption of imprinting via hypermethylation of ICRs leads to a loss of imprinting at the <em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster, the Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome and associated Wilm's tumor via suppression of the <em>H19 </em>growth-restraining gene and overexpression of the growth-enhancing <em>Igf2</em> gene, promoting excessive cell growth, as in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an cytidine analog, enzymatic epigenetic regulator that inhibits DNA methyltransferase and, as a result, induces DNA hypomethylation.  It is a small-molecule nucleoside analog that non-selectively but irreversibly binds to DNA methyltransferases – thus a DNMT inhibitor.  It is incorporated into DNA upon replication (and is therefore replication dependent, which targets cancer cells due to their rapid replication), leading to DNA demethylation or hypomethylation in the daughter cells.  Decitabine has an anti-tumor effect because it leads to DNA demethylation, therefore effecting the removal of DNA methylation and hypermethylation epigenetic marks.  Since DNA hypermethylation is often seen in cancer cells, for example, in the CpG island promoters of tumor cells that inactivates tumor suppressor genes, demethylation with Decitabine is therapeutic.  It is currently approved for the treatment of MDS (MyeloDysplastic Syndrome).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have enduring effects beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable.  Drug-induced changes in DNA methylation are therefore also mitotically heritable into daughter generations of cells, long after the drug is no longer administered.  A sensitive period is a time during development when epigenetic marks are reprogrammed/actively remodeled; i.e., when epigenetic marks are removed and laid down.  Sensitive periods occur early in development/embryogenesis and during primordial germ cell development (except imprinting, where epigenetic marks are not reprogrammed in early embryogenesis), including ages of 9-12 in boys and 8-10 in girls.  During sensitive periods environmental changes – famine, carcinogen-rich smoke, or DNA demethylation drugs – can have a marked effect on epigenetic programming.  Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because epigenetic marks are removed during sensitive periods and then must be reprogrammed.  The use of DNA methylation-altering drugs during sensitive periods could prevent the reestablishment of epigenetic marks necessary for normally-functioning cells.  Adverse effects could be severe.  It makes more sense to use drugs like DNMT inhibitors early in carcinogenesis, if possible, when enzymatic epigenetic regulators are likely to be most effective.</p></div>
