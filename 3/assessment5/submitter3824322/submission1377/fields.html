    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation is an epigentic tool to control gene expression. It involves the addition of a methyl group to specific spots in DNA. Methylation is mitotically heritable, meaning the marks are preserved in DNA during cell division. Hypermethylation refers to the addition of methyl groups. Hypomethylation referes to the removal of methyl groups. <span>In cancer, DNA </span><span>can become</span><span> abnormally </span><span>hypermethylated </span><span>and</span><span> hypomethylated, depending on tumor type. </span><span>CpG islands in gene promoters </span><span>are</span><span> s</span><span>ensitive areas</span><span> in DNA that </span><span>can </span><span>become </span><span>hypermethylated</span><span> in cancer</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>CpG islands in gene promoters are usually unmethylated however methylation can be used to control gene expression. The addition of methyl groups to CpG islands in a promoter can prevent transcription enzymes from binding to the promoter site and cause a closed chromatin structure. The gene, now unable to be transcribed, is silenced.</p>
<p>In cases of cancer, when CpG islands become abnormally hypermethylated it can silence tumor suppressor genes. Since methylation marks are mitotically heritable, the result is tumor suppressor genes are not expressed in child cells, aiding the growth of tumors. When a CpG island is hypermethylated the surrounding DNA can also become hypermethylated, further contributing to gene silencing.</p>
<p>In some tumors, CpG poor promoters of growth promoting genes can instead become abnormally hypomethylated. This has the opposite effect of hypermethylation on gene expression but because the genes affected promote growth it still aids tumor growth.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are another example of sensitive areas in DNA. These are areas that are normally methylated to encourage a tightly compacted chromatin structure and prevent expression. They can become abnormally hypomethylated in cancer, opening them up to transcription factors. This can lead to a number of undesirable issues such as DNA deletions, DNA insertions, and DNA translocation, disrupting normal gene expression and destabilizing the genome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is a method of controlling gene expression in which alleles are expressed or silenced based on their parent of origin. It works through DNA methylation of an area called an Imprint Control Region (ICR), which will normally be methylated on one allele and unmethylated on the other. Disruption of imprinting methylation marks can contribute to diseases such as cancer. </p>
<p>For example in the H19/Igf2 cluster the maternal allele's ICR is normally unmethylated. The ICR site binds the CTCF insulator protein that blocks transcription enhancers from expressing the Igf2 gene. The enhancers can still access the H19 gene and so it is expressed. </p>
<p>The ICR on the paternal allele is normally methylated. The CTCF insulator protein now cannot bind to block transcription enhancers from expressing Igf2. This also has the effect of silencing the H19 gene through spreading of methylation into the H19 promoter. </p>
<p>In Wilm's Tumor the maternal allele becomes abnormally methylated. The maternal allele now acts like a paternal allele, expressing Igf2 and silencing H19. The net effect to the cell is overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth promoting gene, and silencing of H19, a growth suppressor. This contributes to tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When a cell divides, methylation marks are transferred to the new DNA strand by a protein called DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). In cancer, abnormal methylation marks are preserved in new cells through the action of DNMT. </p>
<p>Decitabine is an anti-cancer drug that prevents DNMT from transferring methylation marks to new DNA. Decitabine is part of a class of epigentic inhibitors called DNMT inhibitors or DNA-demethylating agents. </p>
<p><span>Decitabine is thought to be effective against cancer because it stops the abnormal (as well as normal) methylation marks from being passed on to new cells. </span><span>The</span><span> new cells </span><span>can now </span><span>express tumor suppressor genes previously silenced by abnormal methylation. </span><span>This may have the effect of stopping tumor growth or make the tumor more susceptible to other forms of treatment such as chemotherapy.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation marks are mitotically heritable, meaning they are preserved during cell division and are usually only changed by direct intervention of epigentic machinery. Epigentic machinery will not restore a previous state once it has been changed.This results in lasting consequences when a methylation mark is changed by medical treatment. This is of particular concern during sensitive periods, when cells are undergoing epigenetic reprogramming.</p>
<p>Early development and germ cell development are two such sensitive periods. During these periods epigenetic marks are being removed and set based on the intended function of the cell. It is critical to the health of the organism and the ability of the organism to have healthy offspring that cells are set up correctly. </p>
<p>Disease treatments that target epigenetic machinery are likely to disrupt normal epigentic reprogramming during sensitive periods and consequently prevent normal cell function. Because of the way epigentic state is passed on to new cells, epigenetic changes made by treatments may have permanent health consequences for the patient as they age and may effect their ability to have healthy offspring. Benefit from the treatment during sensitive periods may be overshadowed by this risk.</p></div>
