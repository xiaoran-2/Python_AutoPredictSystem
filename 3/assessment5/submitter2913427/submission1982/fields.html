    <h1>Submission 1982 from Anon (session_user_id: b0cbf975ba849b6901a73e11f60f1c3ca62f0b94)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine has been used to treat cancer patients. It is a member of DNA methyltransferases inhibitors, which overall promote DNA hypomethylation. More specifically, Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into DNA and binds irreversibly to the DNA methyltransferases, thus disabling them. Its mechanism of action is still not quite clear, but one can easily conclude from the above information that it is replication dependent.</p>
<p>The anti-tumour effect of Decitabine is easily understood when one focus on one of the key characteristics of cancer cells, uncontrolled replication. Specifically, as mentioned above, its action is replication dependent, so one can easily conclude that the cells that are going to be affected the most are the ones that replicate the fastest, that is the cancer cells (also there is  effect on other normal cells that replicate more frequently).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The modification of the epigenetic characteristics has been increasingly targeted by scientists nowadays in order to understand the impact of these changes on serious diseases and particularly cancer. One of the main targets is DNA methylation, as its role is quite important. Specifically, one of the key characteristics of this process is that changes in DNA methylation can be transmitted to the next generations of cells until the epigenetic mechanism resets them, thus having a lasting effect.</p>
<p>However, the administration of drugs that target the epigenetic machinery of the cells generally, and the DNA methylation specifically, should be prohibited during certain periods of the life of one individual, in which periods the takes place the reset of the epigenetic machinery and the re-establishment of the epigenetic marks; these periods are called sensitive periods. Such periods during development, are the primordial germ cell development (during which the epigenome of the gamete producing cells is reset) and the early development (during which the epigenome of the newly formed embryo is re-established). As previously mentioned, treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable, as such an action could have  severe effects on the formation of the epigenome.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a key process in the organization of the epigenome. However, when one thinks about the CpG islands (CpG dinucleotides clusters, usually found in the promoters of genes), they tend to be unmethylated under normal circumstances, regardless of their activity status. This should come as no surprise, as the methylation of the CpG islands leads to the suppression of the expression of the particular gene(s). This is exactly what happens in cancer cells, where CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, thus disabling genes, many of which are crucial for the normal function of the cell (e.g tumor-suppressor genes).</p>
<p>Another important aspect of DNA methylation is the one that includes the methylation status of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Normally, genes that are highly expressed tend to have their intergenic regions methylated without understanding the exact reason behind it, although various speculations are made (repression of transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibition of the antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing, correlation to replication timing). Also, the repetitive elements, mainly the LINEs &amp; SINEs, as well as satellite repeats, tend to be methylated in normal cells, in order to contain them for uncontrolled spreading. However, in cancer cells the methylation status of the above regions tends to change radically; they tend to be hypomethylated. This should come as no surprise, as the hypomethylation of intergenic regions has been implicated in the appearance of  abnormal proteins/mRNAs in cancer cells, while the hypomethylation of the repetitive elements leads to the activation of those sequences, which move around the genome dynamically and interrupt exons, thus leading to abnormal protein sequences/mRNAs and cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster basically contains an ICR locus, whose role is - when methylated- to block the binding of insulators (e.g CTCF). In the paternally imprinted version of the locus, this results in the activation of Igf2 from enhancers that are located downstream. Specifically, without the presence of CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter to silence &amp; enhancers can access Igf2 to activate it. To the contrary, in the maternally imprinted version, there is no DNA methylation, thus allowing the CTCF to bind &amp; H19 promoter to properly initiate the expression of the gene, through interaction with the enhancers.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, there is a rather abnormal imprinting pattern. Specifically, we can observe that ICR on the maternal allele has been damaged, thus resulting in the maternal allele behaving like the paternal one. This in turn leads to overexpression of the Igf2, which contributes to the appearance of the cancer through its tumor promoting role.</p></div>
