    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, DNA is methylated at junctures in the DNA code where cytosine precedes guanine (CpG). The additional methyl is attached to the double helix at CpG dinucleotides in the C5 position by DNA de novo methyltransferases (DNMT) 3a and 3b and results in hemi-methylated DNA. Because hemi-methylated DNA acts as a substrate for DNMT1, the pattern of methylation is maintained through subsequent cell divisions by DNMT1 and becomes hereditary. The function of DNA methylation is to silence the gene that underlies that portion of DNA. Clusters of CpG sites are actually unmethylated and act as "windows", allowing the formation of transcription factors that are dictated by the underlying DNA code. In cancer cells, the CpG islands of tumor suppressor cells become hypermethylated and the gene is silenced. This silencing is achieved by the methyl simultaneously attracting binding proteins to create CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP) that represses transcription and attracting factors that change the chromatin architecture by condensing euchromatin, which is easily "readable", into heterochromatin, which is dense and intractable.As mentioned above, the majority of DNA code in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements is methylated. This methylation "is required for proper embryogenesis and development, (and) for sustaining chromosomal stability, telomere length, and predetermined gene expression states".In cancer cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements suffer from hypomethylation. This means that areas of the DNA code that are silenced in normal cells will become active, leading to "genomic instability and deregulation of tissue-specific and imprinted genes".

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting occurs on one allele when imprint control regions (ICR) are methylated, leading to long noncoding RNA or enhancer blockers that control activation or inactivation of the DNA code. The H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of when an enhancer is blocked. On the paternal allele, DNA methylation blocks CTCF binding and the absence of CTCF allows enhances downstream of H19 access to Igf2, activating the Igf2 so that it is expressed. On the maternal allele, the CTCF is not methylated and the presence of CTCF blocks the enhancers having access to Igf2. Instead, they connect with H19 and Igf2 is not expressed. In Wilm's tumour, the methylation pattern is disrupted and CTCF is methylated on both the maternal and paternal alleles, leaving the enhancers downstream of H19 free access to Igf2 on both alleles and a consequent over expression of Igf2 and increased activity of the growth promoting gene.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-methylating agent. It reduces methylation of the histone proteins in cancerous cells. Methylation by the enzyme EZH2 of histone proteins in cancer packs the chromatin more densely than in normal cells and thus represses the gene, including tumour-suppressor genes. A demethylating agent such as Decitabine removes methyl from the histone proteins and unravels the chromatin to allow genes to be expressed again. Decitabine has an anti-tumour effect because tumor suppressor genes that were silenced have become active again when heterochromatin is turned back to euchromatin.(Epigenetics Controls Reading of Genetic Code, Epigenie, http://epigenie.com/epigenetics/cancer-epigenetics/  2013)(Epigenomics of Cancer, Hassler and Egger, Biochimie, 2012)(Marnie, Epigenetics video lectures on Coursera, 2013)(Cancer's Epicentre, The Economist, 2012)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because the methylation pattern is passed on in dividing cells. When DNA strand is formed in the new cells UHRF1 detects the CpG sites that are methylated on one strand of the parent DNA, and DNMT1 adds a methyl at that group on the new strand. Sensitive periods are times when the epigenome is being reprogrammed and occur during development of the embryo and when primordial germ cells are being developed. This means that children between the ages of 9 and 14 and also pregnant women should not be treated with drugs that alter the epigenome because at these times the epigenome is vulnerable to mutations, which could be transmitted through generations of the cells.(Epigenetics Controls Reading of Genetic Code, Epigenie, http://epigenie.com/epigenetics/cancer-epigenetics/  2013)(Epigenomics of Cancer, Hassler and Egger, Biochimie, 2012)(Marnie, Epigenetics video lectures on Coursera, 2013)(Cancer's Epicentre, The Economist, 2012)</p>
