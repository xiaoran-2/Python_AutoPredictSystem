    <h1>Submission 876 from Anon (session_user_id: 7123ee23cc3eaff6f24f119fa4eba7986fb9ece6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), one of the several classes of epigenetic inhibitors. Decitabine inhibits methylation incorporating into DNA. When DNA methyltransferase comes to copy methylation after cell division, it is irreversibly bound to this enzyme preventing further methylation. For this reason, DNMTi inhibits methylation on during cell replication. The cancer cells are more affected by DNMTi due to their more rapid division rate. By suppressing methylation of genes such as tumor suppressors, making them active, DNMTi can kill tumor cells. Although the mechanism of DNMTi is not completely clear, since CpG island hypermethylation is shown to lead to poor outcome in certain class of cancer patients, this demethylating agent seem to help them. Decitabine has also shown to be well-tolerated by the users and those who might not show direct improvement through the drug have shown that it can enhance the effectiveness of the chemotherapy afterwards.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation of CpG island usually means silencing of gene expression. Most normal cells are often unmethylated at CpG islands. The cancer cells however, tend to have hypermethylation at CpG islands. The hypermethylation at CpG islands in cancer cells are linked to silencing of tumour suppressor genes. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the silencing of tumour suppressor gene is propagated to the daughter cells. The silencing of tumour suppressor gene leads to the uncontrolled division of cells and long living cells, leading to tumour and metastasis.</p>
<p>In normal cells, DNA tend to have methylation in intergenic and/or repetitive elements; in contrast, cancer cells tend to have hypomethylations in these regions.  These intergenic and/or repetitive elements were shown to be related to expression of growth promoting genes. Therefore, the hypomethylation leads to the overexpression of growth promoting genes, which contributes the rapid rate of division of cancer cells. Since the methylation at CpG island leads to silencing of tumour suppressor genes, and the hypomethylation at intergenic and/or repetitive elements leads to over expression of growth promoting genes, the cancer cells tend to grow out of control and rapidly spread.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because it is mitotically heritable. That is, as cell divides, the methylation carries forward to its daughter cells. This means that even after the patients have stopped taking the epigenetic drugs, the effect of the drug will carry forward to the subsequent cells, creating lasting changes in the cell epigenome. The sensitive periods refers to the early development and primordial germ cell development during which the epigenetic programming reset and reprogrammed. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because that is when the cells are most susceptible to epigenetic reprogramming. Changing epigenomic markers during this period could affect the patients’ offsprings down the generations as this is the time when epigenetic programming is set in germ cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting refers to monoallelic gene expression based on its parent of origin. This is known to be critical for embryo viability and is set during the primordial germ cell development. Imprinting is controlled by imprint control regions (ICRs) and an imprint is associated with DNA methylation at the ICR. One example of this process is known as enhancer blocking process occurring at H19/lgf2 cluster. H19/lgf2 cluster has lgf2 gene upstream from H19 gene and downstream enhancers. In normal maternal cell, an insulator protein CTCF blocks the enhancers from working on lgf2 expression, thereby promoting H19 production. When there is methylation at CTCF binding site as well as H19 gene (as in paternal allele), the enhancers act on lgf2 gene. Wilm’s tumour occurs when the CTCF binding site is removed due to mutation. This disruption disrupts CTCF binding, thereby enhancing the lgf2 upstream production through enhancer. This also is related to methylation at H19. Since lgf2 is growth promoting and H19 is growth regulating, removing regulation and promoting growth results in uncontrolled growth like tumour.</p></div>
