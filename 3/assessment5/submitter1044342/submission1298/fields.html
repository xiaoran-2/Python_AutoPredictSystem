    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is regulation of gene expression of genes which have a promotor including the CpG islands. In cancer cells they are often hypermethylated and thereby cause silecing of certain tumour supressor genes which, in response, promotes tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, the normal function of found DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements causes them to stay transcriptionaly not active. This type of methylation is commonly lost in cancer due to the global hypomethylated phenotype of cancer cells. This causes genomic instability, for example chromosomal translocations, chromosomal inversion or deletions often encountered in cancer cells, which causes a mutator phenotip and a faster progression of a disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altered DNA methylation in tumour cells compared to normal cells shows genome wide loss of DNA methylation but also a gain of DNA methylation in promotor CpG regions of certain tumour supressor genes and subsequently their silencing. If epigenetic drugs change this pattern it can lead to subsequent sensitivity of cancer cells to standard chemoterapeutics. Sensitive period  in organism development is time when there is a establishment of  epigenetic marks in gametogenesis and early preimplatation  development and treating patients during sensitive periods could lead to growth defects or permanent change to offspring.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor which belongs to a class of DNA-demethylating agents, which means that it causes a removal of DNA methylation in rapidly dividing cancer cells. By eliminating of the hypermethylation of promotor CpG islands of certain tumour suppresor genes which is a common ocurance in cancer cells it can restore their normal function and thereby act as an anti-tumour agent.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting of H19/Igf2 cluster can contribute to cancer by causing elevated production of growth factor Igf2 which can promote tumour growth. Normaly on paternal allele an ICR region is methylated so CTCF factor can not bind it and enhancer located downstream of the H19 gene can interact with Igf2 promotor which  causes a Igf2 expression from only paternal alele. However, a maternal alele in unmethylated and CTCF binds a ICR causing a silencint in Igf2 expression and stimulating the transcription of H19 only from maternal alele.  In Wilms tumour the imprinting of H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in a way that there is a expression patern mimicing to paternaly imprinted aleles active in a cell. That causes too much of Igf2 protein present in the organism which is a growth factor so it can cause a increase cell divisions.</p></div>
