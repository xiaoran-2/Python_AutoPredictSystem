    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the post-replication modification of DNA involving the addition of a methyl group to cytosine (5<sup>th</sup> position) or adenine (6<sup>th</sup> nitrogen). Generally, DNA methylation is associated with gene silencing. Normal cells show genome-wide hypermethylation and hypomethylation in CpG islands and island shores. This methylation pattern of CpG islands in normal cells help to maintain genomic stability as well as the proper regulation of tissue-specific and imprinted genes. Aberrant DNA methylation is characteristic of cancer cells with the reverse being the case; in cancer cells we find genome-wide hypomethylation accompanied by hypermethylation of CpG islands. When this aberration results in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes (i.e. via hypermethylation of the genes or their promoter regions) it results in cancer progression. Other complications include genomic instability, deregulation of imprinted and tumor-specific genes, e.t.c. Hypermethylation of CpG Island Methylator phenotype (CIMP) has been implicated in several cancers including colorectal cancers, breast cancers and gliomas. Nerve sheath tumors also show methylation of CpG island shores.</p>
<p>Aberrant DNA methylation could arise due to activating or inactivating mutations in epigenetic enzymes (e.g. DNMTs), lncRNAs- or transcription factors-mediated faulty targeting and nuclear architecture spatio-temporal organizational changes.</p>
<p>Some non-coding RNAs also mediate epigenetic regulations arising from normal expressions in intergenic regions. lncRNAs can cause the assembly and localization of activating or inactivating protein complexes to target DNA sequences resulting in the normal gene expression. The maintenance of pluripotency and differentiation requires the association of lincRNAs (present at intergenic sites containing H3K4me and H3K36me) with chromatin remodelling complexes.</p>
<p>Abnormal expression of non-coding RNAs such as T-UCRs have been identified in hepatocellular carcinomas, neuroblastomas, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and colorectal cancers. Overexpression of satellite repeats has also been seen in epithelial and pancreatic cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon involving the differential expression of genes in a parent-of-origin-specific fashion. This monoallelic gene expression is usually lost in cancer cells. DNA methylation, which is the basis of genomic imprinting, does not always result in gene silencing; rather, it depends on the imprint control region (ICR) and its regulated gene cluster.</p>
<p>In the case of the <em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster, DNA methylation results in the silencing of ICR, which then prevents the binding of the insulator protein CTCF (allowing the enhancers to act on the <em>Igf2</em> gene).</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated; hence, allowing the binding of CTCF. This prevents the action of the enhancers on maternal <em>Igf2</em> while they now enhance the expression of <em>H19</em> (a lncRNAs which harbours certain miRNAs). On the paternal allele, the methylation of ICR (which spreads to and silences <em>H19</em>) and the consequent absence of CTCF binding allow the action of the enhancers on <em>Igf2</em> (which is a growth promoter – <em>an oncogene</em>) - Mechanism: Enhancer Blocking.</p>
<p>The paternal expression of <em>Igf2</em> and the maternal expression of <em>Cdkn1c</em> results in balanced growth. Uniparental disomy, genetic mutations and epigenetic disruptions resulting in loss of imprinting could lead to overexpression of <em>Igf2</em>. Phenotypic manifestations includes macroglossia, post-natal overgrowth and Wilm’s tumor (a childhood kidney tumor)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a DNA-demethylating agent, is an anti-cancer drug produced by Essai (a Japanese company) with brand name, Dacogen. Decitabine has been used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, which leads to acute myelogenous leukaemia. The function of this drug is to remove methylation in DNA.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in cancers cells usually results in silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) which then results in uncontrolled tumor growth. In such conditions, Decitabine acts by removing the methylation (hence, promoting the expression of those TSGs) and thereby produces an anti-cancer activity.</p>
<p>At other times overexpression of proto-oncogenes could result from aberrant DNA methylation. The demethylating action of Decitabine in those cases is to return back to normal the modulated activity of the oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Although DNA methylation is lost during epigenetic reprogramming (e.g. gametogenesis and after fertilization), it is a stable epigenetic mark that is passed on to subsequent cell generations. Therefore, altering the methylation pattern of a somatic cell will have an enduring effect since it is mitotically heritable and passed on to daughter cells until it is actively erased. This active DNA demethylation only occurs during primordial germ cell development and certain stages of cellular differentiation. These periods when the normal methylation patterns of a cell epigenome are prone to alterations/changes is collectively known as the sensitive period.</p>
<p>Anti-cancer drugs that alter methylation can have effects lasting beyond their treatment period because (i) The methylation alterations produced by the drugs are carried on and sustained in the daughter cells of the tumor cells, (ii) The drugs act by inhibiting the growth of the tumor cells (other than affecting their methylation pattern).</p>
<p>It is not advisable to administer such drugs during sensitive periods because, as earlier stated, the drug could be the cause of epigenetic mutation at this period by altering normal DNA methylation patterns.</p></div>
