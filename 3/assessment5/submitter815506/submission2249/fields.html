    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in mammals occurs mainly at CpG islands which are primarily present at the promoter regions of a particular gene.Normally,CpG islands found to be in unmethylated (active) state but when methylated it results in silencing (inactive) of that gene. <br />Tumor suppressor (TS) genes are mainly responsible for suppression of tumor formation in cell division cycle. But in cancer cells TS genes got silenced by hyper methylation at CpG Islands of these genes so in this way disrupted DNA methylation leads to cancer </p>
<p>when CpG islands got methylated it will silence that particular gene so we can say it is like mutaiton in that gene. so swithching off any gene through CpG methylation will definatly results in a diseased state.</p>
<p>intergenic regions &amp; repetitive elements are generally found in methylated (silenced) state which is required for genomic integrity.hypomethylation of both of these genomic regions will leads to genomic instability in which deletion,insertion and illegitimate recombinations are involved.<br />In cancer repetitive elements and intergenic regions both are present in hypomethylated state but we know that methylation of both above said regions is necessory for genomic siencing which is resulted into incresed genomic stabilty. hypomethylation of both the regions will decrease genomic stability by increasing illegitimate recombination, activation of transposons and gene disruptions.<br /><br />in the same way as mentioned above with refrence to cancer,disrupted DNA methylation (hypomethylation) of repetitive elements and intergenic regions will be resulted in a diseased state</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>hypo and hyper methylation of imprint controll regions (ICR) will result in loss of imprinting which in turn can results in loss of expresion of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes.<br /><br />In general from paternal allele Igf2 is found to be expressed because ICR &amp; H19 in this allele found to be methylated so CTCF will not be able to bind with ICR. finally when CTCF is absent from ICR so enhancer will act on Igf2 and got in expressed.<br /><br />but in maternal allele ICR is not methylated as in paternal allele so CTCF will bind with unmethylated ICR/H19 cluster and block action of enhancer on Igf2 locus. finally Igf2 found to be unexpressed from maternal allele.<br /><br />in wilm's tumor <span>H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted and both paternal and maternal allele found to be methylated hence Igf2 can expressed from both alleles in this case. Igf2 is a growth factor so it will favour the growth of cancer cell and finally leads to a cancer i.e - wilms tumor . </span></p></div>
