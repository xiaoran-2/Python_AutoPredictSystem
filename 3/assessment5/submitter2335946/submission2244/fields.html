    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are hypomethylated in normal cells and consequently for example tumour suppressor genes are expressed. But in cancer cells those regions could be hypermethylated causing deactivation of tumour suppressor genes and so activation growth factor genes which were controled by that suppression mechanism in normal cells.</p>
<p>In normal cells repetitive elements should not be expressed so they often hypermethylated, but in cancer cells we could see overall hypomethylation and those regions loose methylation - consequently chromatine is less densely packaged there and could be errors (splicing) at cell divisions that increases genome instability: some genes could be demaged and so they would be silenced, some strong promoters could be opened leading to overexpression of related genes.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of CPG poor promoters could also influence on gene expression ballance of a cell.</p>
<p>As we could see the role of DNA methylation is context dependent.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 gene in the maternal allele of normal cell is silenced by CTCF binding to unmethylated ICR (imprint control region) locking Igf2 futher (than H19) region enhanced transcription cause enhancers to act on H19. In contrast on the paternal allele ICR is methylated and that methylation propagate to H19 region causing enhancers to act on futher Igf2 region - they enhance that gene expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour ICR of maternal allele is also hypermethylated causing CTCF could not bind to that site and so Igf2 is overexpressed. Doubled Igf2 expression cause twice growth factor promotion and this is associated with Wilm's tumour in childhood development.</p>
<p>Similar mechanisms in other regions could disrupt growth factor balance either by hypermethylation of ICRs as in the described example or by hypomethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that inhibits DNA methyltransferase for example EZH2 that is overexpressed in many solid tumours. This inhibitor irreversibly bind DNA methyltransferases after they are incorporated into DNA in replicating cell causing DNA demethylation<span class="short_text" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span class="hps"> in descendant cells</span></span>. And consequently tumour suppressor genes (previously inhibited/silenced by methylation or may be by chromatine dense packaging by methylated histones) could now be expressed causing better control of cells growth factors. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation could cause disballance of genes expression that is not so critical for adult patients but could cause side effects for <span class="short_text" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span class="hps">younger</span> <span class="hps">patient</span></span> whose organism's cells still passes sensitive growth periods (for example effects on germ cells need to be considered) when even tiny influeces could cause some subsequent deseases. As desribed drugs are not gene specific they could cause shift in gene expression of normal cells. And at sensitive periods such as germ cell development could also alter descendant epigenome.</p></div>
