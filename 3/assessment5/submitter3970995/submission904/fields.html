    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:left;">In normal cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated; they have lower concentrations of methylation than the rest of the local DNA strand. This changes in cancer cells. Instead of displaying hypomethylation, CpG islands become hypermethylated; they display much higher levels of methylation than the rest of the DNA strand.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">DNA methylation at individual CpG islands has the potential to activate oncogenes, which cause over-proliferation of cells, and is one contributing factor of cancer. Alone, however, this is not enough to actually cause cancer, as tumour suppressor genes act against these oncogenes. This plays in to the Knudson hypothesis, where cancer is the ultimate result of multiple “hits”, or insults, to DNA; simply activating oncogenes is merely one “hit”. Methylation of CpG islands, however, also results in the silencing of these tumour suppressor genes. This is a second “hit”; individual CpG island methylation activates oncogenes and silences tumour suppressor genes, and thus has the ability to cause cancer. Furthermore, this occurs at a much higher frequency than mutations.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Intergenic regions and repetitive elements show a methylation pattern opposite to that of CpG islands. That is, in normal cells, these regions are hypermethylated; they display high levels of methylation. As cells move to becoming cancerous, however, the global level of methylation decreases. This means that intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated.</p>
<p>At these regions, this hypomethylation causes genomic instability through a variety of mechanisms. First, it may prompt illegitimate recombination, which often results in deletions or translocations, altering the genetic structure and perhaps prompting cell proliferation. Reciprocal translocations can themselves also be caused by hypomethylation of these intergenic regions; acquired translocations have been shown to cause several types of cancer. Hypomethylation may also activate cryptic promoters, or cause disruption to neighbouring genes, both of which may have profound genetic consequences.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:left;">In a normal cell, imprinting control regions (ICRs) on the paternal allele are methylated, preventing the binding of the protein CTCF, thereby allowing the expression of Igf2. In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated. So, CTCF is able to bind to the ICR, allowing enhancers to act on H19; this in turn prevents the activation of Igf2. Combined, this means one active copy of Igf2 between the paternal and maternal alleles.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If, however, the ICR becomes hypermethylated in the maternal allele, CTCF is not able to bind. This blocks the enhancers’ activity, and allows Igf2 to be expressed on the maternal allele. This occurs in Wilm’s tumour, a childhood kidney tumour. Igf2 becomes expressed on both the maternal and paternal allele. Igf2 is growth promoting, and so two active copies increase cell growth and proliferation, which is associated with Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:left;">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can cause lasting effects on the epigenome, as DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. This is how it can cause tumours; the methylation state of one cell causes it to proliferate, and as the daughter cells will also have the same methylation state, they too will proliferate, and so on. So drugs that reduce or increase methylation work on the same principle; their methylation states are inherited, and endure in the epigenome.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As such, it is important to consider sensitive periods when treating with these drugs. Sensitive periods are those stages of development where the epigenome is undergoing reprogramming. These periods not only include early foetal development, when the DNA methylation state changes, but also during the development of primordial germ cells.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">To treat patients during these sensitive periods, such as very young patients or in females at certain stages of pregnancy, is therefore inadvisable. Changing the methylation state at these times may give rise to further disorders or diseases, and may even cause non-viability in offspring if the methylation pattern is altered too heavily. Furthermore, these changes will persist, and will require further risky treatment to reverse.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:left;">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. By inhibiting DNMT, Decitabine is able to hypomethylate DNA.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Although the specific mechanisms of action of DNMT inhibitors still remain unknown, it is known that drugs in this class, such as Decitabine, bind irreversibly to DNMTs after becoming incorporated into the DNA. It is known that epigenetic alterations, unlike mutations, are reversible; as such, Decitabine can reverse hypermethylation at CpG islands through hypomethylation, and thus restoring the activity of tumour suppressors.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It is important to remember, however, that DNMT inhibitors may not always be beneficial; only when tumours are driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation will Decitabine have a positive effect. This is why it is used in myelodysplastic syndromes; it is able to restore order to DNA methylation.</p></div>
