    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">In the normal cells CpG island are tipically unmethylated but methylation plays a role in the inactivation of chromosome X and in the imprinting, silencing genes that only have to be expressed from the paternal or the maternal allele. In cancer cells, it is common to be a locus-specific hypermethylation of CpG dimers located in CpG islands that progress with the life-time of the tumour. Hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter of a tumour suppressor gene (controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair gene) can silence this gene (or made a loss of imprinting), giving to that cell a growth advantage that can be one hit in the multiple-hit Knudson’s model of cell transformation to cancer. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">In the normal cells there is a methylation of repetitive elements (to keep them silenced and avoid the genomic stability they produce when they are active) and methylation in intergenic and  intronic regions (to avoid transcription of genes that are not necessary for a specific tissue or for a specific time in the development and to repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, to inhibit antisense transcription and direct RNA splicing). In cancer cells there is a genome-wide hypomethylation that affect repetitive sequences, and intragenic and intronic regions. The hypomethylation of intragenic and intronic regions in cancer cells can lead to a deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes that can lead cell transformation to cancer. The hypomethylation of repetitive elements can lead to cancer due to genomic instability caused by the repetitive element activation, which can make copies or splicing of the repetitive element and which would jump in another place of the genome. The genomic instability can be also caused due to chromosome translocations by recombination between 2 repetitive elements (that are not any more densely packaged in heterocromatin).</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele the Imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated. When the ICR is methylated it blocks the CTCF bound so the downstream enhancers act on IgF2 and promote IgF2 expression in the paternal allele.  </p>
<p>In the maternal allele there the ICR is unmethylated so it is bound for the protein CTCF that insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. The enhancers act on H19 that is produced only from the maternal allele and the IgF2 is silenced.</p>
<p>In the Wilm’s tumour there is a loss of imprinting and the maternal allele in the ICR in the H19/Igf2 cluster it’s hypermethylated. This made that CTCF don’t bound ICR and the downstream enhancers act in IgF2 promoting its expression. IgF2 is expressed from both parental alleles so we have an overexpression of IgF2 that is a growth promoter. This can be an early event in the tumerogenesis of the Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decetiabine drug used to treat the myelodysplasic syndrome that acts hypomethylating DNA by inhibiting methyltransferase (DNMTi).</p>
<p>Decetiabine it’s a nucleoside analog that when it’s incorporated into DNA it binds DNMTs irreversibly. DNMTs can’t be released and can’t copy the methylation to the daughter strand so after each replication the new strands aren’t methylated.</p>
<p>All the cells that undergo replication are sensible to this drug, but as tumour cells replicate more frequently than normal cells this drug have more effect in the tumour cells. This drug cans hypomethylate the CpG islands that were hypermethylated in the tumour and permit the expression of the genes that were repressed by the methylation of the CpG islands (e.g. expressing again a tumour suppressor gene) slowing the tumour growth.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is maintained in cell division by copying the methylation of the parental strand to the daughter strand by DNA methyltransferases. This way all the cell daughters will have the same methylation pattern than the parental cell. If we alter the DNA methylation using a drug this will have an enduring effect in the daughter cells when we stop using the drug because the methylation pattern will be copied and maintained after the cell divisions.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods are periods in the development where there are active remodelling of the epigenome like the period of the primordial germ cells development to form mature gametes and the period of pre-implantation and early post-implantation period. Treat the patients in this periods would be inadvisable because the natural remodelling of the epigenome (cleaning epigenetic marks in the pre-implantation or early post-implantation and creating new marks in the gametes formation) would be altered so we would have methylation marks in genes that were need to be expressed and a lack of marks in genes that were need to be silenced and this would create a deregulation in the expression of lots of genes and bad side effects that can lead to the death of the individual (the abort of the baby).  </p></div>
