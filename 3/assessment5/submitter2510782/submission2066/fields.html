    <div class="field-value"><p>In general DNA methylation can occur in several sites in the DNA, at CpG islands and in intergenic regions and repetitive elements as well as introns of genes.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In the former, DNA methylation at CpG islands  is involved in silencing gene expression. This is so because CpG islands are often clustered at the promoters of genes which would be necessary to start the process of DNA transcription. By methylating this CpG islands, this prevents DNA transciption from proceeding via the binding of methylated CpG binding proteins and secondarily by preventing transcription factor binding and therefore silencing gene expression. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In normal cells, most CpG islands are not methylated. In many cancer cells however they become hypermethylated specifically at tumor supression genes, which results in the silencing of these genes. In conjunction with several other insults  to a cell like the activation of an oncogene or a mutation in the gene itself, the silencing of tumor surpression genes by hypermethylation at CpG islands can result in the progression of a normal cell to a neoplasm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Conversely in some cases in cancer cells, they can be hypomethylated in CpG poor promoters resulting in the activation of oncogenes which can lead to the formation of malignant cells.  In addition, because 5 methyl cytosine has a tendency to a point mutation to thymine via a spontaneous deamination, it is a potential mutagenic hazard that can result in many genetic disorders as well as promoting cancer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In contrast to CpG islands, DNA methylation in normal cells are common at intergenic regions, repetitive elements and introns. They are responsible  in this locations for  maintaining genomic stability.   In cancer however, they become hypomethylated globally, which makes the genomes vulnerable to insults like deletions, translocations and insertions, which can affect genes responsible for cell growth and proliferation, DNA repair, tumor supression, etc. resulting in  the formation of neoplastic cells.  Hypomethylation can result from DNA Methyl transferase mutations(DNMT) as well as other insults to the epigenetic machinery. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting results in only one allele, either paternal or maternal being expressed. When imprinting is disrupted which can contribute to the formation of cancer, either both alleles or neither of them is expressed. In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, instead of just the paternal allele being expressed, both paternal and maternal alleles are expressed, resulting in the overexpression of Igf2, a growth promoter.  </p>
<p>Normally in the H19/Igf2 cluster, the maternal allele is unmethylated, allowing the CTCF protein to bind to the ICR, resulting in the enhancers acting on H19 and not on on Igf2 which is not expressed. The paternal allele, on the other hand is methylated preventing the CTCF protein from binding to the ICR, allowing the enhancers to act preferentially on the Igf2 gene which allows the expression of Igf2. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, both alleles, paternal and maternal become hypermethylated. As a result there is a doubling in the expression of Igf2 as the maternal allele whose Igf2 gene is normally silenced, becomes active, when the CTCF protein is not allowed to bind to the ICR, allowing the enhancers to preferentially bind to the Igf2 protein, allowing its expression.  </p>
<p>As a result, the overexpression of Ifg2 protein, a growth promoter results the formation of Wilm's tumor. T</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor that acts as a hypomethylating agent. DNMT is an enzyme that is necessary for methylating DNA. Decitabine has been approved for use by the FDA for the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndromes, precursors of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">. Since it is a nucleoside analogue, it is incorporated into DNA during replication, which then irreversibly binds DNMT after replication preventing it from its normal function of methylating Cytosine at CpG sites. It therefore results in DNA demethylation, possibly preventing the tumor suppressor gene from being supressed, allowing it to inhibit tumor growth. Since malignant cells are replicating faster than normal cells, they are more susceptible to the effects of Decitabine which is replication dependent. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since these drugs affect all the cells in the body and not just cancer cells,  we have to be wary about the effects on the epigenome of other cells which can be enduring. There might be long term effects on normal cells that we still don't know of. Some of the enzyme inhibitors like DNMT inhibitors irreversibly bind DNMT for example, preventing it from performing it normal function of methylating loci that require this function. HDAC inhibitors that act on histones, are also pleiotropic acting not only on histones but also inhibit other protein deactylases that might be critical to the function of the cell. None of these enzyme inhibitors are selective affecting not only cancer cells but other cells as well. </p>
<p>All this considerations is especially important when considering treatment during sensitive periods of development. Sensitive periods are stages during an organism's development which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms such as periods of  epigenetic reprogramming.  Two particular sensitive periods of development are the preimplantation period of early development and during primordial germ development or gametogenesis. It is during these periods of development that we should be wary about the effects of drug therapy, as they might have lasting effects on the individual and their progeny at the epigenetic level. </p></div>
