    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>1) CpG islands of promoters are <em>usually</em> hypomethylated in normal cells <span>if the genes are expressed.</span></p>
<p>2) So, CpG-islands - promoters of tumor supressor genes - <em>often</em> are hypermethylated to silence tumor supressor genes in cancer (other promoters can be, as a variant, hypomethylated to express growth promoting genes). DNA-methylation is mitotically heritable - so it is easy way to silence the tumor supressor genes, and epimutations are rapidly selected. </p>
<p>3) Alterations in DNA methiylation at ICRs (hypo/hyper) can result in loss of growth restricting genes / overexpression of growth promoting genes. Typical scheme of methylation is <em>often</em> "swapped" in cancer: CpG-islands are hypermethylated and intergenic regions/repetitive elements are hypomethylated, not like in normal cells. CpG-islands shores (neighbors of islands, 2kbp long) are also hypermethylated in cancer. Hypermethylation of shores correlates well with gene expression, like in normal cells.</p>
<p>4) The normal function of methylation of IR/RE is genomic stability, "good" karyotype and prevention of 6).</p>
<p>5) This type of disruption progresses with time and the whole genome hypomethylation <em>is not particular, but general rule</em> for cancer. (Can be caused by DNMT1 mistakes, DNMT1 inactivation, non-mutagenic cancerogens, etc.)</p>
<p>6) Intergenic regions/repetitive elements (IR/RE) are typically hypomethilated in cancer, that leads to genomic instability (illigal recombination between IR (insertions/deletions/translocations), activation of IR/RE and cryptic promoters). Depletion of DNA methylation appears to enhance tumorogenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>NORMAL CELL: 1) Paternal allele: methylated ICR, so CTCF is not binding and enhancers can act on Igf2, Igf2 is expressed from this allele.</p>
<p>2) Maternal allele: unmethylated ICR, CTCF binds to unmethylated ICR (H19 expressed, lgf2 silent because of enhancers), Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>3) WILM'S TUMOR: Paternal allele: methylated ICR - completely the same as in normal cell.</p>
<p>Maternal allele: methylated ICR. CTCF is not binding, so Igf2 is expressed =&gt; hyperexpression of Igf2 (double dose).</p>
<p>4) The reason of this tumor is loss of imprinting. Normal epigenetic marks that regulate imprinted genes in this region are altered.<em> In that case</em>, DNA methylation in maternal allele blocks insulator factor binding, enabling expression driven by distal enhancers. The major role of Igf2-coded protein is as a growth promoting hormone during gestation, so it is typical type of cancer for kids.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>1) Decitabine, like Vidaza (5-azacytidine), is a cytidine analog (5-aza-2'deoxycytidine) and both of them are <em>DNMT1 inhibitors</em>. </span></p>
<p><span>2) DNMT1 "wants" to bind with cytidine, but "binds" with 5-azacytidine and then goes to another part of the cell. Finally, DNMT1 is destroyed, that leads to decrease of DNMT1 concentration. 5-azacytidine can't be methylated, it contains a nitrogen atom instead of methyl group, and DNMT1 quantity decreases. =&gt;<em> inhibition of DNA methylation.</em></span></p>
<p>3) We can <em>increase</em> tumor supressor genes <em>expression</em> level with the help of cytidine. Decitabine is a variation of cytidine.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1) DNA methylation can stay unchanged because of inheritance (through mitosis - with the help of e.g. DNMT1, through meiosis - with the help of epigenetic reprogramming of imprinted genes), so a lot of changes in epigenome will be inherited (mitotically and/or transgenerational).</p>
<p>2) There are 2 sensitive periods of active epigenetic reprogramming. <em>May be (?)</em> there can be some more periods, with less active reprogramming - the consequences of drug application, such as Vidaza.</p>
<p>3) Germ cells (gametes) development and early embryo development (~blastocyst).</p>
<p>4) Every cell has a potential to be effected by "epigenetic" drugs, so younger patients (who develop the germ cells) are inadvisable to be treated with this kind of drugs, and any effects linked with patients <span>related in one or another way to</span> senstive periods need to be researched.</p></div>
