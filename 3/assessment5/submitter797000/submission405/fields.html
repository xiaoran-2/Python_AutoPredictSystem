    <h1>Submission 405 from Anon (session_user_id: 365382208e3af37138de0ed2e77fbed64ab60277)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p0">Dectabine is one of epigenetic drugs which belongs to DNA-demethylating agent. it inhibits methylation, resulting in the expression of the previously hypermethylated silenced genes. By binding to the enzymes</p>
<p class="p0">that catalyse  the methylation reaction, DNA methyltraferases; and titrate out these enzymes, it takes the effect to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia,</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin . Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene such as silencing of tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA. Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is quite possible. Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.   </p>
<p>    Sensitive periods meant that they are sensitive to the epigenetic marks, such as when altered environments, during embryogenesis/gametogenesis, when marks are established rather than maintained. The epigenetics may play a role in development in embryogenesis, and plays a role in maintaining our tissues, it is difficult to modify once we are adults. For a cancer cell, these epigenetic changes are absolutely essential for the cancer cell to continue behaving as a cancer.       </p>
<p>Epigentic drugs<span class="mejs-captions-text">are going to be used throughout the system until every cell could has a</span> <span class="mejs-captions-text">potential to be effected by these drugs. So <span class="mejs-captions-text"><span class="mejs-captions-text">younger patients, particularly those that have developing germ cells for example in</span> <span class="mejs-captions-text">sensitive periods. </span><span class="mejs-captions-text">so that one very large insult to the environment would be taking a drug </span><span class="mejs-captions-text">that inhibits the epigenetic machinery.

There is this potential for harm to have harm to the children and fetus.</span><br /></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal chromosome, methylation at the ICR not only prevents CTCF from binding, allowing <em>Igf2</em> to engage the enhancers, but it is also required for methylation at the <em>H19</em> promoter and silencing of <em>H19</em>.On the maternal allele in mouse, CTCF binds to 4 binding sites within the ICR, generating an insulator that prevents <em>Igf2</em> from accessing the shared enhancers that are located on the <em>H19</em> side of the insulator. Thus, the insulator effectively acts as an enhancer-blocker.the <em>H19/Igf2</em> locus utilizes a CTCF-dependent insulator to repress <em>Igf2</em> maternally and methylation of the ICR to repress <em>H19</em> paternally. A more commonly employed and recently evolved mechanism of imprinting uses a long non-coding RNA (ncRNA). In this case, the ICR includes a differentially methylated promoter that regulates the expression of an ncRNA; when unmethylated the ncRNA is expressed and represses <em>cis</em>-linked genes. In contrast, when the ICR is methylated, the ncRNA is repressed and the <em>cis</em>-linked genes are expressed. The maternally-expressed <em>Igf2r</em> was first shown to use such a mechanism. At this locus, the ncRNA <em>Airn</em> represses <em>Igf2r</em> ubiquitously and <em>Slc22a2</em> and <em>Slc22a3</em> in the placenta. </p></div>
