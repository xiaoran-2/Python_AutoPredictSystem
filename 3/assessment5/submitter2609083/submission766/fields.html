    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal fuction of DNA methylation in CpG islands at the promoter of genes can inhibit the trasncription of that gene. In cancer we can find a genome wide reversal in the methylation patterns of CpG islands. For example we can observe hypomethylation of normally methylated CpG islands as well as hypermethilation of non-methylated islands. This may lead to the activation of oncogenes and deactivation of tumor supressor genes. In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, methylation blocks non-specific recombination. In cancer, hypomethylation of integenic and repetitive regions might allow intercrhomosomal recombination and translocations, which lead to genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of non-enzymatic epigenetic inhibitors. It de-methylates regions of DNA, for example CpG islands or any DNA region. The effect it can have on cancer would be to de-methylate the control regions of tumor suppressor genes and therefore activating them to combat oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, any change in methylation patterns will be passed on to the progeny cells. A sensitive period refers to a period of time during which specific epigenetic programmin occurs in the organism's cells, which is important for normal functioning. Such periods occur mostly early in development, for example as in Ebryonic Stem Cell development. It would be inadvisable to treat patients with epigenetic inhibitor drugs due to the possible of tampering with the normal process of epigenetic reprogramming required for normal cell development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the case of the paternal allele, igf2 is activated (i.e. non-methylated) whereas the H19 gene is methylated (deactivated). The situation is then reversed in the maternal side. This determines that the paternal igf2 gene is expressed. In the case of Wilm's tumor, it has been found that igf2 is also activated on the maternal side.The effect that this phenomenon has is of increased expression of igf2 and leading to increased predisposition to tumors.</p></div>
