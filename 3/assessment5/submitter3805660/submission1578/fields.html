    <div class="field-value"><p>The mammals present most of the DNA methylation in CpG islands of their DNA sequences. DNA methylation consists in an addition of a methyl group to cytosine that has the function of silencing of epigenetic marks in order to mantain genomic stability in normal healthy cells. Besides it is fundamental during embryogenesis and development of mammals. In cancer the epigenomes are changed in several ways. The hypomethylation genome-wide is one of the changes occurring during cancer in the epigome. It happens in all the types of tumor in earlier stages and throught the time. The consequences of this change is dependent of where it is located. The hypomethylation can occur in intergenic regions, more commonly in repetitive elements and also in CpG poor promotors that are methylated in normal healthy cells. Consequently genomic instability occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This genomic instability can happen in the form of illegitimate recombination of repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes. Moreover in other human diseases a mutation can happen on the de novo demethyltransferase DNMT3B that results in the ICF syndrome  also caused by hypomethylation and consequent genomic instability. Additionaly, in CpG poor promotors of cancer cells, the hypomethylation occurs associated with activation of genes. Some of these genes can be targeting tumor suppressors decreasing their quantity and activity.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The locus H19/Igf2 cluster the paternal allele is methylated at imprint control region. This methylation is responsible for not letting the CTCF to bind to the imprint control region and, consequently, Igf2 is promoted by the enhancers being expressed. On the contrary, in the maternal allele CTCF can bind to sites on the imprint control region and generating an insulator that do not allows access of the enhancers to Igf2 and its respective expression.  DNA methylation changes in ICRs may consequently result in the overexpression of growth promoting genes like is the case of the hypermethylation of ICR in Igf2 causing Wilm´s tumor. Hypermethylation and loss of imprinting leads to the expression of Igf2 in both paternal and maternal alleles. A double quantity of Igf2 is now present promoting Wilm´s tumor that occurs in the kidney of children. In other diseases the loss of imprinting can also lead to the loss of expression of growth restricting genes occurring in early stages of tumor development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of the drugs approved by the Food Drugs Administration Authority (FDA) as a molecular inhibitors of the epigenetic machinery involved in cancer therapies. As one of the drugs considered a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor or DNA hypomethylated agents, decitabine incorporates into DNA strands irreversively. Consequently it induces degradation of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) and hypomethylates DNA. This agents that hypomethylate DNA can activate tumor suppressor genes. So tumor suppressor genes previously silenced by promoter methylation can be expressed again. However the exact mechanism of action of decitabine is still unknown. At low levels decitabine acts through DNA demethylation as described above while at higher levels it induces cell death through the break of DNA strands. Despite this fact this drug is effective in tumors like the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other solid tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic changes as the DNA methylation are mitotically and meiotically heritable. What this means is that they pass from the "mother" cell to the "daughter" cells and consequently through cell generations. In the case of epigenetic therapies it can possibly happen that even without the total cure of the cancer, these drugs are in fact preventing the cancer from growing. The induced epigenetic changes caused by these drugs can be persistent. Moreover in early life the sensitivity to the effects of epigenetic mechanisms is higher during some periods. The influence of the environment in the epigenome is higher in men during mid-childhood while it is higher from conception to 3 years old and during the time of female gametogenesis in women. The maintenance of epigenetic states is sensitive to environmental changes during these periods.</p>
<p>In the treatment of cancer the best time to give a specific drug depends on the effect of DNA methylation on the specific tumor stage and tumor type. However, during sensitive periods it is not advisable to give epigenetic drugs because they can have consequences in the patient, patient children’s and grandchildren’s passed by the epigenome.</p></div>
