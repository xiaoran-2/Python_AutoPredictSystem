    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation are common in cancer.  These alterations are mitotically heritable and are passed on to all daughter cells.  If the alteration in methylation causes the cell to divide more quickly, then these alterations are selected for and the altered cells increase in proportion to normal cells.</p>
<p>CpG Islands are common in mammalian gene promoters and even more so in humans.  Most CpG islands are normally unmethylated, but as cancer progresses, the CGIs become more likely to be methylated.  The hypermethylation of a CGI and CGI shores can block the promoter and silence the gene it is promoting.  If the promoter is for a tumor suppressor gene, then this silencing can cause cancer.  CpG islands are also commonly associated with imprinting and disrupting the normal methylation pattern of the imprinting can lead to cancer since many imprinted genes are related to growth regulation.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements of the genome are normally methylated.  As cancer progresses, the methylation of repeats tends to diminish and the repeat is no longer silenced.  Repeats frequently surround transposons.  When the repeats are activated the transposons can jump to other places in the genome.  This can cause cancer if a transposon jumps into a tumor suppressor gene and disrupts it.  It can also cause cancer if a transposon is inserted next to an oncogene and acts as a promoter for it.  In addition, hypomethylation of repeats increases the chance of recombination errors, including insertions, deletions, and reciprocal translocations.  These errors can lead to deletion of tumor suppressor genes or over-expression of oncogenes.  </p>
<p>Intergenic regions also tend to become less methylated as cancer progresses.  Although a rarer cause of cancer, hypomethylation of intergenic regions can activate a promoter for an oncogene or microRNA that targets a tumor suppressor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is methylated in the imprinting control region (ICR).  This prevents CTCF binding to the ICR.  Without CTCF, methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, silencing it.  The enhancers for Igf2, located on the other side of the ICR, are able to access the Igf2 gene and increase its expression.  The maternal allele is unmethylated at the ICR.  This allows CTCF to bind and blocks the Igf2 enhancers from reaching the Igf2 gene leading to under-expression.  In addition, when the enhancers are blocked by CTCF, they have a secondary affinity for the H19 promoter and increase expression of it.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, both alleles express the paternal pattern.  This can be caused the by the maternal allele being imprinted also, paternal uniparental disomy, or a genetic mutation in the maternal allele which prevents CTCF from binding.</p>
<p>Igf2 is a growth promoter.  H19 is a long non-coding RNA and is a tumor suppressor.  When both alleles express the paternal pattern, this leads to more Igf2 and less H19.  Since this leads to an excess of growth promoter and a deficit of tumor suppressor, it increases the chances of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cancer drug which affects epigenetic processes.  It is a DNA-demethylating agent that inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT).  These DNMT inhibitors result in methylation not being copied after cell division and results in passive demethylation through successive generations of cells.  This demethylation can result in genes no longer being silenced.  In cancers where tumor suppressors are eroneously silenced, demethylating agents can restore their expression allowing them to do their work.  The body has lots of redundant systems working together and cancer normally requires multiple disruptions to occur, so undoing some of the disruptions can be an effective treatment even if ont all disruptions are corrected.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so it is a very stable epigenetic mark not only for the given cell, but daughter cells too.  When a drug alters DNA methylation, the alterations persist for that cell and daughter cells until changed.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those times when epigenetic marks are being established.  The entire genome is sensitive in the period right after fertilization and during primordial germ cell (PGC) development.  Tissue-specific epigenetic marks are established throughout development, so different tissues will have additional sensitive periods.  In addition, there are examples such as with newborn mice whose mothers lick them getting epigenetic marks that help cope with stress throughout their entire lifespan.  Treating a patient during a sensitive period may disrupt the normal establishment of epigenetic marks.  For example, if a patient is treated when PGCs are developing, imprinted genes may not be properly methylated and their offspring is at risk of disease.</p></div>
