    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands cause DNA to not be read.  DNA that can not be read is called “inactive DNA”  When a patient has cancer, the CpG islands are mutated such that islands that were previously unmethylated become so, and islands that are methylated become unmethylated.  This causes some genes that were previously “inactive” to become “active” and “active” DNA becomes “inactive”.  When a patient has a disruption in their normal DNA methylation, genes that express undeseriable effects become active, contributing, in some cases, to loss of immunity or a disrupted immune system, allowing the patient to become ill.  DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is important because these are genes that shouldn't be expressed more than once.  If a repetitive element is expressed more than once,  it causes the overproduction of the protein associated with that section of DNA. In cancer, these elements become unmethylated allowing for their transcription, causing excessive cell growth.  When a patient has disrupted DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, they can suffer from excessive hormones, growths, or other similar problems.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, sites between Igf2 and H19 are normally methylated.  This promotes Igf2 expression and H19 expression is inhibited.  On the maternal side, sites between Igf2 and H19 are normally unmethyleted.  This causes H19 to be promoted and expressed, while Igf2 is inhibited.  In Wilm's tumor, both alleles are methylated, causing excessive cell growth caused by expression of Igf2.  When imprinting is disrupted on the H19/Igf2 cluster, methylation occurs on both alleles, causing the expression of the genes to be imbalanced, causing disease in the patient.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine inhibits histone methylation.  This means it prevents cells from methylating histone tails thus preventing genes from being “shut off” and unexpressed.  This is important in Lukemia patients (for which the drug is designed) because cancers methylate (and thereby inactivate)  tumor suppressor genes, thus allowing cell growth to go unchecked.v</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a potentially dangerous method to use because of its long lasting effects.  DNA methylation is sometimes transferred from one cell generation to the next, possibly allowing even grandchildren to be affected by a drug such as Decitabine.  A sensitive period are periods of time in the growth of an organism where reproductive cells are being formed, in which DNA methylation is determined.  This occurs during the time from fetus formation through to the reaching of puberty.  It would not be a good idea for pregnant women or young children to take drugs that affect DNA methylation during sensitive periods because it may affect their children's health due to the possible expression of genes that are normally methylated.</p></div>
