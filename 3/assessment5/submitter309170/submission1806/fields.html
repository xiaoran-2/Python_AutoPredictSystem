    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is  an addition of a single methyl  group to cytosine and it<span> can almost exclusively happen  on CpG islands  in the DNA sequence. <span>CpG methylation is a silencing epigenetic mark .</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>In cancer there are two main mechanisms that disrupt the normal DNA layout:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>- genomic hypomethylation , especcialy at  the key sites like repetitive sequences or introns and inner exons.</p>
<p>-<span>focal hypermethylation of <span> CpG islands that is  associated with silencing the expression of tumor supressor gene  .</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Normal DNA methylation is also involved in <span>silencing of repetitive element ,preventing transposition, and the methylation of the <span> intergenic regions , maintaining the genome integrity. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>In cancer this mechanisms are disrupted, the <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements </span></span></span></span></span>are hypomethilated causing instability  of the genome  by  promoting  illegitimal deletions, translocations and insertions .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19<span> is a gene for a long non-coding RNA ,i</span>t's being produced just from the maternal allele . Its  role is being a resevoir for a particular micro RNA.It is bound by a protein called CTCF,  an insulator protein.</p>
<p>On the patternal allele when this imprint control region is methlyated CTCF can no longer bind and  promote Igf2's expression (using enhancers) , therefore, Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele and not the maternal allele.</p>
<p> H19 is not active on the paternal allele  because of the  DNA methylation spreading downstream into the H19 promoter.</p>
<p>These two clusters,can be disrupted in the  Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome.</p>
<p>In this case , there an appearance of two paternal like alleles and loss of the maternal like allele, with  too much Igf2 growth promoting.</p>
<p>This is called loss of imprinting, and so you'll have both alleles behaving like the paternal allele.</p>
<p>These individuals are predisposed to embryonic or childhood tumours such as Wilms tumor which is found in the kidney  by overexpression of growth promoting genes or loss of the  suppressor  genes .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a  a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor , a nucleoside analog.</p>
<p>The drug molecules are  incorporated into the DNA upon replication and when DNMT1  binds to  that nucleotide so then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly .DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent so you have to have the cell replicating.</p>
<p>So this means that cancer cells which are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body will be more severely affected.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation helps to maintain transcriptional silence in nonexpressed or noncoding regions of the genome, hence altering this mechanism could influence in a negaitive way gene expression and sillencing , for example by helping express sillenced genes involved in alterations of the genome as the repetitive elements .</span></p>
<p>Sensitive periods are the stages in which  the epigenetic marks are erased and layed out again. </p>
<p>This sensitive periods are in the early deveopment - fertilisation to blastocyst stage -  and during the primordial germ cells development.</p>
<p>Using the drugs could alter the normal processes and  this could mean a lack of epigentic mark or an abarent layout  resulting in an aberant gene activation, inhibitor sillencing  with the final result of  genome instability.</p>
