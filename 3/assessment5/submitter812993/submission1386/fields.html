    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The normal function is suppressive, i.e. silencing of these regions. Regions are methylated .                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </span>Islands are hypermethylated thus silencing tumor suppressor genes and promoting oncogenes epigenetically or genetically (allowing expression) in hypomethylated regions (intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>Normally unmethylated usually located at gene promoter sites, those that are silence gene expression. This is done by inducing a repressive chromatin structure and prohibit transcription factor binding.</p>
<p>In addition to cancer as described above, methylation can also lead to expression of both maternal and paternal allelles or suppression of both leading to deregulation of  growth factors, (Wilm’s tumor) etc.</p>
<p>These areas become hypomethylated and thus allowing expression and genomic instability   </p>
<p>May allow transposition and other transcriptional interference which can result in a variety of disease states</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele the ICR and H19 promoters are  methylated and thus silenced and enhancers can access Igf2 to promote expression. </p>
<p>In the maternal allele neither are methylated and CTCF binds to the ICR thus blocking enhancers access to the Igf2 and silencing expression. H19 is active</p>
<p>The maternal ICR is hypermethylated and the H19 promoter locus as well (identical to the paternal). This results in both Igf2 sites being active and  results in an overexpression of Igf2 leading to loss of growth regulation.</p>
<p>Disruption can either result in expression of both genes or neither and thus lead to over or under regulation of controlled functions</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is in the  hypomethylating agent class.(Wikipedia)</p>
<p> It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>Tumors can be initiated by hyper or hypo methylation dependent upon the activation of oncogenes and/or the suppression of Tumor suppressor genes. Decitabine counter the effects of the overactive EZH2 which is a methylator and overactivity associated with lymphomas. It leads to lower methylation levels</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is somatically inheritable. Changes induced can be passed on which is important to cellular differentiation in eukaryotes.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of development when significant changes are occuring</p>
<p>Certain embryonic stages in relation to the overall genome/epigenome</p>
<p>Genetic changes may be induced directly or indirectly (gene expresion or epigentic effects)</p></div>
