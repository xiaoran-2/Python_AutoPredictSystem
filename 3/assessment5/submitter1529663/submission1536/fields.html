    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>CpG islands</strong> are segments of DNA which the frequency of cytosine and guanine are higher that other regions. These islands are located in the 5´regulatory regions of many genes. <strong>DNA methylation</strong> referres to the addition of amethyl group to the cytosien or adenine. It has been described that DNA methylation may affect the transcription of genes in two ways: the methylation of DNA itself may physically impede the binding of transcriptional proteins to the gene, or methylated DNA may be bound by methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBDs), that recruit additional proteins to the locus, and modifying histones. In any way, the result is that the chromyatin turns to be a compact, inactive, called heterochromatine. </p>
<p>DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark that passes to the subsequent cell generation; altough, reprogramming occur during gametogenesis and in the first stages of embryonic development (prior to implantation)</p>
<p> In vertebrates, CpG islands located in promoter of annotated gene are not methylated. However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, then causing silencing of the underlying gene of the promoter of tumour supressors genes (those that controlled cell cycle; apoptosis or DNA repair)</p>
<p> Changing methylation patterns leads to a deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes. The disruptions of DNA methylation at CpG islands may lead to the expression of genes that should have been off. </p>
<p> In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, contrary to what happen in CpG islands, are normally hypermethylated, and become hipomethylated as a consequence to cancer. The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity. The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is to protect the genome from transposable elements. Changing in methylation patterns produce genomic instability (deletetion, reciprocal translocation, insertions) which could be observed as abnormal karyotypes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H197/ Igf2 cluster is an interesting model of imprinting control region (ICR). When the ICR is not methylayed, as in the maternal allele, it is bound by a protein called CTCF, which is a silence protein, an as a result, the Igf2 is not expressed. Thus, the enhancers (located upstream) act at the H19 enhancing the activity of this gene that encode for a long-non-coding RNA. On the contrary, in the paternal allele, ICF is methylated, thus the silencing protein can not bind to this gene, allowing the enhancers to act on Igf2. As a result, Igf2 is only expressed in the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Wilm´s tumour is a disease characterized by the presence of renal tumours during embryonic or childhood but not during adult life. In Wilm’s tumour, the imprinting at the H19/Igf2 is disrupted so both alleles act as a paternal, expressing too much Igf2 and not expressing Cdkn1C which inhibit growth (antitumour). It could be the result of mutation or deletion that lead to the lost of imprinting, uniparental disomy (when two copies of the allele 11, in this case, is inherited from the father), or because of imprinting disruption.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a member of epigenetic inhibitors drugs known as DNA demethylating agents, used to treat Myelodysplastic syndromes.  This drug has an epigenetic effect  interfering with the DNA methylation.  By this process, restores the normal function of the tumor suppressor genes.  It has been used in combination with another drug, a histone-deacetylase inhibitor. The combine effect of both drugs slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer; showing for the first time, that epigenetic drugs could have a successful effect on solid tumour. Another good outcome of the combination of  both drugs was that patients showed an unexpectedly good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed after. Dr Baylin, clinical researcher in charge of this trial, speculates that the epigenetic drugs might altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Once cancer start, the genetic alterations are almost impossible to reverse. However, the epigenetic aberrations are potentially reversible, allowing the malignant cell population to revert to a more normal state. Numerous new drugs are being designed to target specific enzymes involving in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Drugs affecting DNA methylation can cause changes in gene expression that persist long after the treatment has ceased. The drugs use in epigenetic treatment appears switch on gene that regulate growth cells instead of trying to kill the sick cells, as the chemotherapies drugs do. These drugs, as Azacitidine, are very toxic at high doses, but giving in a very low dose are well tolerate by the patients, and may affect gene expression in tumors allowing the cells to reprogram.</p>
<p> The sensitive period is referring to the time that DNA undergoes demethylation and remethylation to erase previous imprints and reestablish epigenetics marks. It occurs during pre-implantation (2 cells embryo, 4 cell embryo, morula and blastocyte), and during gametogenesis. Treating young patients with epigenetic drugs would be inadvisable since would affect cells in their sensitive periods. For the same reason would be inappropriate to treat pregnant women with drugs that affect DNA methylation.</p></div>
