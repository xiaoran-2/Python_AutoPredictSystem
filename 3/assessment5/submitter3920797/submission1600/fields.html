    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG island methylation silences the expression of the gene downstream and can become an attaching point to other proteins that cause more long-range effects.</p>
<p>In cancer, some CpG islands are hypermethylated, either silencing those genes (probably tumor-supressors) or causing the indirect overexpression of oncogenes or tumor-favoring genes (as in the H19/Igf2 cluster example in Wilm's Tumor).</p>
<p>Apart from cancer, aberrant DNA methylation of CpG islands can cause other diseases. A well undestood example is the agouti viable yellow allele in mice. The methylation of the CpG island at the strong LTR promoter upstream from the agouti gene prevents it from overexpressing and causing diseases like diabetes and obesity. This is also observed in developing fetus during the Dutch hunger winter showing that a correct DNA methylation can also cause long-term disease effects in humans.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements usually have transposable elements that could cause diseases if they "jump" and disrupt other genes and also strong promoters that can overexpress near genes. Euchromatic repetitive elements are prone to aberrant interchromosomic recombination due to its homology, that could lead to genomic instability. In order to prevent this from happening, those regions are silenced via DNA methylation.</p>
<p>In cancer a genome-wide hipomethylation is observed, specially in those intergenic and repetitive regions, altering gene expression and causing genomic instability as explained above.</p>
<p>Aberrant intergenic or repetitive element DNA methylation can cause diseases too, as seen in the mice examples of agouti and axin fused, in which an IAP insertion caused diseases by aberrant expression of the surrounding genes. Firstly this insertion could be avoided by a methylation of the original IAP, and secondly DNA methylation of the CpG island of the LTR promoter that the IAP carries could also prevent the disease from happening.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele the ICR and the H19 CpG island are methylated, H19 doesn't express and the enhancers downstream act on the Igf2 gene expressing it.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated allowing CTCF binding, which avoids the expression of Igf2 by the enhancers.</p>
<p>In the majority of Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele's ICR is methylated as in the paternal allele, thus having double dosis of this growth factor and tendency to overgrowth and tumorgenesis, like what happens in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, in which the patient recieves a germline epimutation of the maternal allele imprinted as if it were a paternal allele.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that causes irreversible inhibition of DNMT in actively replicating cells.</p>
<p>Decitabine treatment would cause an overall reduction in the methylation, most noticeable in replicating cells with hypermethylations, and this reduction in the methylation could cause the reactivation of previously silenced tumor supressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitocally heritable due to DNMT1 activity over hemimethylated chromatins, thus stable DNA methylation disruption does have long lasting effects.</p>
<p>A sentitive period in epigenetics is a period in which epigenetic marks are erased and reestablished, such as gametogenesis and early stages of embrionic development.</p>
<p>Treating patients with this kind of drugs would cause his/her gametes to be hipomethylated, this is specially important in parentally imprinted genes, because this are not reestablished during early embrionic development. Also, treating a "early-pregnant" woman with placental-penetrating drugs would disrupt that early embrionic reestablishment of epigenetic mark causing a global hipomethylation in the embryo and </p></div>
