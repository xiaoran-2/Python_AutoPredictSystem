    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation occurs at CpG dinucleotides. CpG islands can be found in about 60% of promoters. In normal cells, these islands usually unmethylated that allow gene expression. But in cancer cells, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated that result to silencing of gene expression. Tumor suppressor genes are frequently silence in cancer. These genes involve with controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. Aberrant silencing of these genes disrupts the normal homeostasis of cells that may cause cancer. For example, silencing <em>RB</em> lead to abnormal cell proliferation due to the function of <em>RB</em> is inhibiting cell division to prevent excessive cell growth. In addition, CpG islands shores surrounding CpG islands about 2 kb also methylated in cancer cells that lead to alteration of gene expression. </p>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements of genes usually methylated to maintain genomic integrity such as silence cryptic transcription start sites at intergenic regions, silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and prevent illegitimate recombination. In cancer cells, these two regions tend to be unmetylated and result to genome instability which generates random mutations and enhances tumorigenesis. There are more illegitimate recombination and mobilization of transposons due to activation of repetitive elements. Genome instability may lead to misexpression of genes such as loss of function of tumor suppressor genes and gain of function of oncogenes that cause cancer eventually.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. This agent is analogue of cytidine, so it can incorporate into DNA during replication and inhibits DNA methyltransferase which is an enzyme that transfer methyl group to DNA causing DNA hypomethylation. In tumor cells, DNA methylation pattern is alter, for example, increasing methylation at CpG islands of promoters that normally unmethylation. Therefore, treating cancer cells with Decitabine may restore normal function of genes that control cell cycle, apoptosis, or DNA repair. In addition, Decitabine is cell cycle specific because it insensitive to non-proliferating cells. So it is good for treat cancer cells which are highly proliferation.    </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster consist of four elements - <em>Igf2</em>, ICR, <em>H19</em> and enhancers respectively. In maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated and bind to CTCF which is an insulator protein. Binding to CTCF prevent DNA methylation spread to <em>H19</em> promoter, so enhancers can activate <em>H19</em> expression while <em>Igf2</em> is repressed. In paternal allele, ICR is methylated and cannot bind to CTCF. Without CTCF, <em>H19</em> is silence due to DNA methylation spreading at the promoter. Therefore enhancers go to activate the expression of <em>Igf2</em> instead of <em>H19</em>.    </p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, the pattern of DNA methylation at ICR is changed. There is methylation at ICR of maternal allele which normally unmethylated. Both paternal and maternal alleles have the same expression pattern of <em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster that is <em>Igf2</em> expression and <em>H19</em> suppression. Igf2 is a growth factor that promotes cell growth and division. So in tumor cells which the level of Igf2 is higher than normal cells about two times, cell proliferation is abnormal and high level of Igf2 enhances tumorigenesis.         </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DMA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark because their pattern of can be pass on to the daughter cells until they are erased. So altering the pattern of DNA methylation have enduring effects. </p>
<p>Sensitive period is the period of epigenetic reprogramming in early development and primordial germ cell development. Treating patient with drugs that alter DNA methylation during these periods is not suggested because the effect of drugs will interfere the epigenetic reprogramming that may lead to an aberrant pattern of epigenetic in primordial germ cells. This pattern alteration may result in the abnormal development of progeny.     </p>
