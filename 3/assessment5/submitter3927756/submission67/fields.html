    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>In a normal cell, DNA methylation at CpG islands is rare and tissue or locus specific. This is because CpG islands are usually found at the promoter of  developmental genes and tumor suppressor genes that are expressed during the life time of the cell to regulate its function and growth. Methylation marks on a CpG island in a normal cell include H3K4me3, which is an activating mark. In addition, it also contains H3 and H4 acetylation (activating) marks. DNA methylation in cancer cells is disrupted in the sense that the CpG islands are hypermethylated. The CpG islands in cancer cells have decreased H3K4me3 and H3/H4 acetylation marks while increased H3K9me and H3K27me marks, leading to hypermethylation and silencing of the gene. This hypermethylation silences tumor suppressor genes and other lineage specific genes causing the tumor cells to behave like stem cells—plasticity. The down regulation of the tumor suppressor genes promotes uncontrolled growth of the cancer cells, facilitating metastasis of the primary tumor. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in a normal cell’s DNA are hypermethylated. This is so that the repetitive elements cannot activate and jump throughout the genome disrupting normal gene function. However, in cancer cells these elements are hypomethylated. Along with the introns and repetitive elements there is an overall decrease in cytosine methylation. This causes activation of the repeats and other elements such as transposones, which jump into or near the promoter of genes, enhancing the expression of genes. This in turn causes lymphomas. The activated repetitive DNA sequences can also cause aberrant recombination of chromosomal regions, causing insertion/deletion/translocations—another hallmark of cancer cells. Due to the mitotic heritability of the epigenetic marks, these aberrant methylation marks are maintained in the malignant clones.</strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>In normal cells, the ICR on paternal copy of chromosome is hypermethylated and silenced so that CTCF cannot bind to ICR. This causes spreading of methylation to nearby H19 locus. The enhancers downstream of ICR now act on the Igf2 locus, highly expressing Igf2, a growth factor. On the other hand, ICR on the maternal copy of the chromosome is unmethylated so that CTCF can bind to ICR. This disables the enhancers downstream of ICR to act on Igf2 locus. The enhancers now act on the promoter of H19 gene, thus highly expressing H19, but not expressing Igf2.</strong></p>
<p><strong>However, in Wilm’s tumor, ICRs on both maternal and paternal copies is methylated (imprinted). The methylation spreads into nearby H19 gene. The methylation on ICRs prevent the binding of CTCF to the ICRs, thus enabling the enhancers to act on Igf2 locus, expressing Igf2 from both copies leading to overexpression of the growth factor. Overexpression of growth factor or growth promoting genes leads to uncontrolled proliferation of cells eventually leading to metastasis and cancer.</strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTi). It is a nucleoside analog, when incorporated into DNA binds permanently to DNA methyltransferase. This prevents more DNA methylation. However, it lacks specificity. Therefore, it will act on cells throughout the body, but its effect is mostly on cancer cells since they divide at a higher rate (have higher drug concentration) than normal cells and DMNTis are replication dependent. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Standard chemotherapy when given after the use of epigenetic drugs such as Decitabine, alter tumor cells so that the tumor is more susceptible to the chemotherapy drugs. Decitabine may reduce the hypermethylation on promoters of tumor suppressor and growth cycle regulator genes--activating the expression of these genes, which have anti-tumor effects. These erased epigenetic marks are passed on to the daughter cells during mitotic cell division, and thus the genes remain activated in daughter cells, reducing the amount of tumor cells. </strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome through mitotic cell divisions. Epigenetic marks are mitotically inheritable; hence they are maintained throughout the life of the cell. Thus, the drugs that reverse the epigenetic marks of the cancer cell, have anti-tumor effect, because the altered epigenetic marks can be passed on to the daughter cells, which gradually increase the number of normal cells and decrease the number of neoplastic cells.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sensitive period of development is when the environment or altered environment can have an effect on epigenetic control. It is the time when epigenetic marks are established. The two sensitive periods of development are early development (embryogenesis) and development of primodial germ cells (gametogenesis).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Since sensitive period marks the establishment of epigenetic marks, treating patients with epigenetic drugs during that time, will alter the epigenome that will then be passed on to all the daughter cells. The alteration of epigenome of the gametes can be passed on to future generations. Thus, a drug such as a DNMTi, will inhibit DNA methyl marks throughout the genome if given during sensitive period. Inhibition of methyl marks in previous studies has been shown to be fatal to the growing embryo.</strong></p></div>
