    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine or Dacogene is DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi)that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. The effect of methylation is that supresses gene expression. This proccess involve the supression of tumour suppression genes that are the genes in charge to stop the uncontrolled cell division and cell growth that cause the cancer. A drug like Decitabine binds the DNMTs in an irreversible way after its incorporation to the DNA. That inhibits the transfer of the metyl group and allows the expression of tumour suppression genes preventing the tumourgenesis.The problem of this kind of drugs is that the whole mechanism of action is still unclear and we do not know if it could have any long term effect in the health cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-value"><p>In the human genome, about 70-80% of CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells are methylated in the C5 position of the cytosine. DNA methylation is essential for some epigenetic processes such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. In a normal situation, the DNA methylation of promoter regions ussually correlates in an inverse way with gene expression. It means that methylation supresses or reduces gene expression. However, some regions in the genome avoid this effect. In about 60% of promoters, there are some nucleotide repetitions of C and G called the CpG islands, which are usually unmethylated with independency of their activity state. One of the most important phenomena  in cancer cells is that promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, leading to silencing the underlying gene. This fact leads to the cancer progression step by step: hyperplasia, neoplasia and invasion due to the inhibition of tumour supression genes. An important fact is that the CpG island methylation pattern seems to differenciate different kinds of tumours.</p>
<p>In human DNA, the Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and LINEs and SINEs (came from ancient retroviral insertions). Also, is common to see some intergenic methylation in a normal cell. Meanwhile in a tumour, the repetitive sequences and the intergenic regions are hypomethylated. The relevance of methylation in this regions is that favours genetic stability, so in tumours the DNA instability is higher leading to chromosomal abnormalities (deletions, translocations, insertions...). The package is low and the chromosomes are more prone to recombine between them.</p>
<p>To sum up, in cancer we could find two sides of the same coin: depletion of methylation seems to suppresses tumourigenesis in the case of tumour suppression genes but on the contrary leads to chromosomal instability which enhances tumourigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is commonly related to expression of genes i.e. methylation suppresses, non-methylation activates. Nevertheless, once methylation has occurred in a cell, all cells resulting from the first one's division (daughters, granddoughters...) will present the same methylation patterns of their predecesor.</p>
<p>On the other hand, during growth there are periods in which the development of certain regions or areas of the organism (e.g. brain areas) are still in development, and therefore depend on small groups of initial cells. During these periods (i.e. early growth stages), specific changes in DNA methylation in these starting cells can have a significant effect on the full development of this areas, since those changes will be passing from the initial cells to all the future ones. These periods are the sensitive ones.</p>
<p>Since early growth stages are those in which more growth and critical gene expression may happen, treating patients in these stages could lead to even fatal consequences, since epigenetic dgrugs could be altering DNA methylation not only on the targeted region, but also on other DNA regions whose expression might be essential for the correct and full development of certain areas of the organism.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The presence or absence of imprinting methylation can have a significant role in some cases of cancer. For instance, following the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the Igf2 region is followed by the imprinting control one, then the H19 and finally the enhancers.</p>
<p>In a normal person, we can see that one allelle (e.g. paternal) will present both the imprinting region and the H19 one methylated, while the other allelle (e.g. maternal) will be normal (unmethylated), therefore allowing CTCF binding to the maternal Igf2 region and the enhancers acting on the H19 region while silencing the Igf2 region i.e. one allelle (maternal) will be H19 activated and Igf2 silent while the other one (paternal) will be H19 silent while Igf2 activated.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when hypermethylation, both maternal and paternal allelles present methylation on the imprinting control and H19 regions i.e. hypermethylation. This leads to double Igf2 expression, which causes Wilm's tumor, since Igf2 is a growth promoter and its dose will be doubled.</p>
<p>Also, this is caracterised for being found in preneoplastic tissues (child's kidney), which indicates that these hypermethylation cases must happen in very early stages instead of later ones.</p></div>
