    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands as rule are not methylated in normal cells since it is important for gene expression, in particularly for binding of proteins to a promoter region. However, in cancer cells CpG (and CpG island shores) islands become methylated and prevent transcription. Repression of transcription of tumor suppressor genes and imprinted genes by CpG methylation is one of the reasons of cancer. Once methylation of CpG occures, this property is epigenetically inhereted (since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable) to following generations of cancer cells. CpG methylation can suppress significant gene and emerge cancer, as with RB, MLH1, BRCA1 genes. Otherwise, it could slightly change epigenetic state of many genes with significant total effect that leads to cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells, since otherwise leads to genomic instability and other genetic abnormalities. In cancer cells, these regions are hypomethylated genome-wide. There are several bed effects: hypomethylation of repetitve elements leads to complementary pairing of similar repeats which became accessible, which leads to genomic instability such as translocations; accessibility of intergenic region leads to transcription of transposons, which could jump into coding region, promoter and disrupt correct gene expression. These effects could also lead to repression of tumor suppressors gene expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting genes are often involved in growth processes, so why they could be important factors of cancer. Both hyper- and hypo- methylation of imprinted center region (ICR) could lead to abnormalities. For example, <span>H19/Igf2 cluster leads to Wilm's tumour. In normal cells ICR of patternal allele is methylated that leads to suppression of H19 through promoter methylation and induction of Igf2 through interaction with enhancer. Demethylation of ICR in maternal allele emerges interaction of CTCF with ICR that leads to induction of H19 transcription and suppression of Igf2 transcription since CTCF prevents interaction of enhancer with Igf2 promoter.</span></p>
<p><span>In tumour cells hypermethylation of ICR leads to induction of Igf2 transcription and repression of H19 transcription  in maternal allele (no allele specific expression). This leads to double dose of Igf2. Ifg2 is a growth promoting gene, thus double dose causes Wilm's tumour.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) inhibitors. It is incorporated into DNA during replication and further interacts with DNMT. Decitabine demetylates DNA by binding of DNMT1 before methylation of daughter strand was occured. However, the drug has not specificity to tumour cells and affect all dividing cells. Small doses give good effect, particularly they suppress methylation in tumour cells, while having small side effect on normal cells. However, big doses have nonspecific toxic effect that leads to illnes of patients. This happens possibly because Decitabine nonspecificly demethylates all parts of a genome in different tissues.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation control gene expression, prevent transcription of repetitive elements and intergenic regions. Incorrect DNA methylation can lead to cancer, for example due to abnormal transcription of growth factor genes. If it is known that a particular gene or other genome element is crucial for cancer because of incorrect DNA methylation, than сorrection of DNA methylation level is a meaningful approach. Since DNA methylation is epigenetically heritable, correction would lead to correct methylation in next generations of cancer cells, that is particularly important because of fast cell division in cancer. This is why alter of DNA methylation by drugs is useful. However, there are sensitive periods of development, when epigenetic marks are reseted.  Two sensitive periods when epigenetic repogramming occurs include periods of germ cell development and early embryonic development.Treatment during these periods can cause incorrect establishment of DNA methylation, that affect current cells and all further cell generations (since DNA methylation is heritable).</p></div>
