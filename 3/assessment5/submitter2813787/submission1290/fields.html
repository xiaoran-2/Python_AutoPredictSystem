    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotides is a universal epigenetic modification which regulates gene expression and maintains genomic integrity. In cancers, most common epigenetic aberrations are those associated with DNA methylation, classified as locus-specific DNA hypermethylation and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, as described.</span></p>
<p>CpG tracts in gene promoters, called CpG islands (CGIs), are normally unmethylated to allow for transcription activation. However, aberrant CGI hypermethylation (silencing) of tumor suppressor genes occurs in cancerous cells. Coupled with the Knudson hypothesis, frequent occurrence of CGI hypermethylation in tumours is attributed to  the mitotically heritable nature of DNA methylation and rapid selection of epimutations. CGI hypermethylation is tumour type- and stage-specific, increasing with cancer progression. In fact, tumour suppressor hypermethylation is occurs more frequently than genetic mutations in cancers. e.g BRCA1 in breast cancer. CGI hypermethylation serves as feasible biomarkers due to the high sensitivity of its detection in cancer cells as against normals cells, as exemplified by CIMP in chacterizing tumours based on the methylation profiles of their associated gene sets.</p>
<p>The genome mostly consists of intergenic and repetitive elements whose CpG dinucletides are generally hypermethylated (therefore silenced) in the normal cell. Genome-wide hypomethylation occurs early in tumorigenesis and progresses with time. <br />In normal cells, repeats and intergenic intervals are hypermethylated to maintain genomic stability. Upon hypomethylation, activated repeats and transpositions switch on cryptic promoters and disrupt neighbouring genes. Additionally, hypomethylation facilitates the euchromatic state therefore allowing illegitimate recombinations which manifests in chromosomal deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in cancers. Evidence in mammals support that DNA methyltransferase mutations and deletions leads to increased genomic instabilty and finally cancer.<br />Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters is rarely observed in cancers. This results in oncogenic (e.g R-Ras in gastric cancer), and in microRNA activation  (e.g. miR21 activation that targets tumour suppressor PTEN in gliomas).</p>
<p>DNA methylation aberrations are context- and stage-dependent, i.e, cancers may either be driven by tumour-suppressor silencing or by chromosomal instability during their lifetime.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 gene cluster is a fine example of genomic imprinting and how its dysregulation can give rise to disease.</p>
<p>This locus is chacterized by the ICR consisting of the upstream Igf2 locus, while downstream lies H19 gene and further down, the enhancers. Normally, H19/Igf2 ICR is paternally imprinted i.e, methylated, and so is the H19 promoter which results in H19 silencing. The expressed enhancers bind to the Igf2 gene upstream and enhances its expression. Therefore, in the normal scenario, the paternal allele is imprinted and Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, ICR is not methylated, which allows for H19 expression. Moreover, the large CTCF molecule occupies the ICR and sets a "boundary", thereby obstructing the enhancers from binding to the Igf2 gene. Therefore, expression Igf2 gene is silenced from the maternal allele. THus, the individual receives only a single dose of the IGF2 protein.</p>
<p>In Wilm's Tumour, the maternal allele is aberrantly hypermethylated and it thereby undergoes the same epigenetic changes as the paternal allele resulting in doubled Igf2 expression leading to a host of growth related disorders.</p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs, and thus loss of imprinting, ultimately result in loss of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes and therefore are commonly found in cancers - characterized by dysregulated growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (Dacogen by Eisai) is a DNA demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, <span>the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine would act be involved in DNA demethylation. In cancers, this agent functions by targetting hypermethylated regions of the genome, i.e, CpG islands of silenced tumour suppressor genes, and in turn would reactivate these genes. The renewed acitvation of tumour suppressors would contribute greatly to the anti-tumour effect. Increased production of tumour suppressors would help reduce dysregulation of cell cycle and cell growth.  Moreover, as this drug is used at the precursor stage, it would check and probably eliminate disease progression at an early and more manageable phase. However, a probable side-effect of this drug may be the hypomethylation of the intergenic and repeat regions which in turn may lead to added other cancer complications. Therefore drug dosage must be suitably specified for optimal results.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modifications are reversible. DNA methylation modifications are mitotically heritable and so are thus maintained. This property is used in clonal expansion of cancerous cells and therefore can also be manipulated for anti-cancer drug treatment. Epigenetic therapuetics can effectively treat cancers my modifying their epigenetic aberrations without having to kill the cells or destroy normal cells as may be the case in chemotherapy. This can be used in altering DNA methylations in the epigenome too.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those wherein in the environment and epigenetic changes are most effective, these include precursor germ cell development in embryos and children. THerefore dosage has to be monitored such that it wold not ave lasting harmful effects on future generations. </p></div>
