    <h1>Submission 874 from Anon (session_user_id: 639f215a341c565fc412f3ab0b2ccde0528995db)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a current epigenetic drug available in the market.This drug is part of the DNMT inhibitors (DNA methyl transface) and it causes DNA-demethylation. Decitabine is a nucleoside analouge, meaning it only functions during replication. When the DNMT comes to bind the nucleotide, the decitabine irreversibly binds to it. Since the inhibitor is replication dependent, cancer cells will be the most affected by the drug due to the fact that cancer cells replicate quickly. However, only small doses of decitabine cause DNA-demethylation and cause cancer cells to die. Large doses are toxic and generally don't kill cancer cells. So far, decitabine has only been effective on haematological cancers. It is still unknown why this is the case. Currently, trials are being done on the effect of decitabine on other types of tumours. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><blockquote>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code">In a normal cell, the CpG islands are demethylated. However, in a cancer cell, the CpG islands are methylated. This hypermethylation of the CpG islands causes tumour suppressor genes to be silenced. Also, because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the daughter cells of the will have their tumour suppressor genes silenced. Because these genes are silenced, the affected cells will most likely divide more rapidly and survive longer then cells with the active genes. These cells with the silenced genes would eventually take over the surrounding tissue and cause disease. In cancer, the DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is also changed. Normal cells have DNA methylation occuring at intergenic regions and reptitive elements, but cancer cells have no methylation at these sites. DNA methylation is involved with genomic stability, and the lack of methylation at these sites can cause the genome to become unstable. This instability can cause illegitimate recombination of repeats, deletions, insertions, and translocations in the genome because of the lack of DNA methylation.The lack of methylation can also cause the repeats to activate or transpose to other genes. This may then disrupt with the expression of neighboring genes. This genomic instibility is seen in many cancers, showing how important DNA methylation at these sites is for genomic stability.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell Igf2 is expressed on the paternal allele and silenced on the maternal allele.On the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated while the imprint control region on the maternal allele is not methylated. Because the imprint control region on the maternal allele is not methylated, CTCF will bind to this site causing the enhancers to act on H19 and causing Igf2 to be silent. However, on the paternal allele, since the imprint control region is methylated, the enhancers will act on Igf2. However, this does not occur in Wilm's tumour. During Wilm's tumour, there is hypermethylation at the imprint control region on the maternal allele, meaning that Igf2 will be expressed. This means that the cell is getting twice the amount of Igf2 is should be getting because Igf2 is still being expressed on the paternal allels. This leads to Wilm's tumour because Igf2 is a growth promoter gene, causing tumours. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an important epigenetic regulator. One reason for this is because it is miotically inheritible. This means that if there is a change to the DNA methylation of one cell, then the cell's offspring will inherit that change to the epigenome. For this reason drugs that affect DNA methylation should not be given to patients during a sensitive period of time. A sensitive period in time is when epigenitic marks are being established and are not being activly maintained. For humans, sensitive periods occur during embryogenesis and gametogenesis. Other sensitive periods for humans are between the ages 9-12 for males and 8-10 for females. One should avoid treating a person with drugs that change DNA methylation during these time periods because, not only will the changes last for the reminder of the patients life, the offspring of these paitents may have changes to their epigenome that may be harmful to them. </p></div>
