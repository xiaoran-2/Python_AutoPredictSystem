    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic information in every cell in an individual is same eventhough each cell type is having unique functional role and phenotype.  This is made possible via several epigenetic modification of cellular genome that allows differential gene expression patterns in different cell types.  Various epigenetic modification that brings about this involves DNA methylation, histone modification and remodeling, long non coding RNA, etc.  DNA methylation is the basis for imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or formation of heterochromatin.</p>
<p>DNA Methylation is an important epigenetic marker and final outcome of methylation depends on the site where it had happened.  In normal cells, CpG islands remains unmethylated for proper expression of the gene, while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.</p>
<p>CpG islands (high CpG density) are found in about 60% of promoters.  The hypomethylated nature of CpG islands aids in promoter function by destabilizing nucleosomes and makes it transcriptionally permissive. The CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation, independent whether the gene is active or not. However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the gene since this hypermethylation makes the promoter site unavailable for transcription.  Thousands of genes (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, DNA repair genes, apoptosis mediators, nuclear receptors, transcription factors, cell adhesion molecules), particularly tumour suppressor genes are epigenetically silenced by CpG island hypermethylation in cancer and this has been termed as CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP).</p>
<p>Hypermethylated Intergenic regions and repetitive elements help to repress transcriptional noise from alternative start-sites and inhibit antisense transcription.  Hypomethylation in these areas have varying outcomes - depending on location; if repetitive elements/intergenic regions are hypomethylated, genomic instability results by illegitimate recombination, activation of repeats or cryptic promoters, etc. while hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters cause oncogene activation.  These events culminate in carcinogenesis or other diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Expression of H19 (long noncoding RNA) and IGF2 (Insulin-like growth factor 2) are closely linked, each from different parental alleles.</p>
<p>H19 is paternally imprinted.  In the paternal allele, imprint control region (ICR) for the IGF2/ H19 locus is hypermethylated that prevents the binding of Transcriptional repressor (CTCF) and allow the expression of IGF2 from that allele.</p>
<p>ICR for the IGF2/ H19 locus is unmethylated in maternal allele and is bound by CTCF.  Because CTCF is insulating IGF2, the enhancers are free to act on H19 and H19 expression from maternal allele occurs.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour (a childhood kidney tumour), the imprinting gets disrupted where both paternal and maternal alleles are hypermethylated resulting in expression of IGF2 from both alleles resulting in a double dose of IGF2. This results in malignancy since IGF2 is a growth promoting factor. </p>
<p>Decreased expression of H19 is found to be associated with Adrenocortical neoplasms. Over expression of IGF2 is also associated with Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome.</p>
<p>Increased expression of H19 is associated with hepatocyte proliferation in rat and mouse and is found in several neoplasms such as hepatocellular carcinomas, bladder cancers, breast cancer, acute T cell leukemia/lymphoma, etc. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The major enzymes involved in the epigenetic regulation are chromatin remodelers, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), Histone deacetylase (HDAC), Histone methyltransferase (HMT), Histone acetyltransferase (HAT), histone demethylase (HDM), TET, etc which often are found mis-expressed in various cancers.  Molecules that could inhibit either of these enzymes are currently under development for cancer therapy.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes play a role in the etiology of cancer and the fact that these changes are reversible; allow it to be utilized for cancer therapy. DNA methyltransferase carry out DNA methylation and in malignancy, regional hypermethylation occurs which lead to genetic instability, repression of tumor suppressor genes and cancer. </p>
<p>Decitabine is a FDA approved DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and has been used for the treatment of myeolodysplastic syndrome.  This molecule hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Thus Decitabine have the ability to inhibit hypermethylation, restore suppressor gene expression and exert antitumor effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on from a cell to daughter cell by DNA methyltransferase which copies the methylation pattern of the parent strand to the daughter stand and persist until it is actively removed enzymatically.  Epigenetic changes have a role in cancer development, progression and resistance. Aberrant DNA methylation at CpG islands are observed in drug resistance.  Removal of these epigenetic changes may render these resistant tumors susceptible to chemotherapy.</p>
<p>In mammals, epigenetic marks are erased during two phases in life and these are the sensitive periods. First sensitive period is post-fertilization (pre-implantation) and second is during primordial germ cell development (PGC). The epigenetic marks in male gamete are actively erased while that of female gamete undergoes passive erasing post fertilization.  A few maternal DNA methylations may escape reprogramming.  In PGC development the epigenetic reprogramming is more extensive.</p>
<p>The age at which an individual is exposed to epigenetic drugs is a critical factor affecting the consequences of such treatment because of these sensitive periods in life.  If a molecule that inhibits the histone demethylase is used for treating a patient during the second sensitive period, epigenetical reprogramming gets disarrayed and this seriously affect the gamete formation and maturation.</p></div>
