    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<ul><li>  In humans and in mice, approximately 60% of all promoters colocalize with CpG islands, which are reasons devoid of methylation that had a higher G+C content than the genome average. The rest have a methylation pattern &amp; base composition that is impossible to tell a-part  from bulk DNA. Studies done recently have shown that both orginisms, have strained our most understandings of how CpG island promoters are orginized in terms of protein-DNA inter-actions &amp; patterns of expressions. In extension to that, the discovery that DNA likeness begin at CpG islands. </li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>There are many cellular pathways that are inactivated by this type of epigenetic lesion: DNA repair (hMLH, MGMT.) Scientests &amp; doctors only know little of the mechansims of abmormal methylation &amp; why certain genes are selected over other genes. Some think that hypermethylation is a isolated layer of epigenetic control, it's not. However, hypermethylation linked to other pieces of the puzzle such as, methyl-binding proteins, DNA methyltransferases &amp; last but not least, histone deacetylase. </li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li><span>While epigenetic changes are required for normal development &amp; health, they can also be responsible for some disease states. Disrupting any of the three systems that contribute to epigenetic alterations can cause abnormal activation or silencing of genes. Such disruptions have been associated with </span><span class="ontologyTermLink">cancer</span><span>, syndromes involving chromosomal instabilities, and mental retardation.</span></li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>The human genome encodes the blueprint of life, but the function of the vast majority of its nearly three billion bases is unknown. </li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>Germ cell tumours are a diverse group of neoplasms that can be histologically subclassified  as either seminomatous or non-seminomatous. These two subtypes have distinct levels of differentiation and clinical characteristics, the non-seminomatous tumours being associated with poorer prognosis.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li> Both losses and gains of DNA methylation are observed, thought to contribute pathophysiologically by inactivating tumor suppressor genes, inducing chromosomal instability and ectopically activating gene expression. Overall, these data support a deterministic rather than a stochastic mechanism for de novo DNA methylation in cancer. </li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br /><br /></p>
<ul><li>Maintenance of genomic imprinting of the murine insulin-likegrowth factor 2 (Igf2) gene involves at least two factors: the DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase activity, which is required to preserve the paternal specific expression ofIgf2, and the H19 gene (lying 90 kb downstream of Igf2 gene), which upon inactivation leads to relaxation of the Igf2 imprint. Selection during development for the appropriate expression of Igf2, dosage-dependent factors that bind to the Igf2 gene, transfer between the parental alleles could be involved in this trans effect.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li><span>DMR0 &amp; IC1 have opposite susceptibilities to global hyper and hypomethylation during tumorigenesis independent of the parent of origin imprint. In contrast, during embryogenesis DMR0 is methylated or demethylated according to the germline methylation imprint at the IC1, indicating different mechanisms of imprinting loss in neoplastic &amp; also non-neoplastic cells.</span></li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>Individuals affected by BWS &amp; SRS display DNA methylation abnormalities at 11p15.5 ICRs in DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs). Epstein Barr Virus(EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (EBV-LCLs) have been shown to maintain DNA methylation at the ICRs over several passages, indicating that epigenetic methylation imprints are maintained in these cells (19,20). </li>

    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>It has been said that, studies show stress in younger people have long-lasting affects  in physiology &amp; behavior in epigenetics. Specific regulatory region of the genome, affecting the expression of a hormone important in controlling mood &amp; cognition into adulthood. This can explain a lot of things that happen to people &amp; their behavior later on in life. Stress endured early in life may influence the quality of physical &amp; mental health in adulthood, such as by causing hormonal alterations associated with mood &amp; cognitive disorders. Until now, scientists did not understand the mechanism by which early life experiences can produce such long lasting effects. According to a common hypothesis, the environment affects mental heath by causing alterations to the physical properties of the genome that influence gene expression, the epigenome. Yes, research suggests that DNA methylation, one of the most intensely studied forms of epigenetics, may explain why maternal care has along term influence on behavior &amp; hormones in rats.</li>
