    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a mechanism for regulation of gene expression. There are multiples sites as CpG island that are target of this kind of regulation. When a DNA sequence in this regions are hypomethylated, there are expression of genes regulated by this region (i. e promoter regions); but when is hypermethylated, it represses transcription of the genes leading to gene silencing. In normal condition, CpG islands are usually unmethylated. </p>
<p>In contrast to CpG islands intergenic and repetitive sequences are methylated, and these conditions are related to maintenance of chromosome structure and genome integrity. So, silencing of repetitive sequences avoid or prevent transposition, illegitimate recombination and interference from strong promoters.</p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation are common in a variety of tumors, in these regard, hypomethylation of oncogenes and hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes have been recognized as a cause of oncogenesis. CpG hypomethylation, in general, arises earlier and is linked to chromosomal instability (deletions, reciprocal translocations and duplications) and loss of imprinting, whereas CpG hypermethylation is associated with promoters and can arise secondary to gene (oncogene suppressor) silencing. In addition, DNMT overexpression also could change the pattern of cell cycle, the apoptosis and the DNA repair following the aberrances of differentiation and adhesion of cells which is often a hallmark of disease.</p>
<p>Regarding to intergenic and repetitive sequences, there are several reports that indicates that is very frequent find hypomethylations in these regions (such as Lin-1, Alu sequences, LTR and satellite repeats) in Cancer. This process haves effects on transcription, possible effects on alternative splicing and, less frequent, induction of retroviral element transcription. Promoter-containing interepersed DNA repeats may affect chromatin boundaries producing alterations on proximal genes. All these alterations have effects on normal expression, may favor oncogenesis by enhancing recombination or activating a small number of endogenous retroviral elements.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is a genetic process by which certain genes can be expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. An example is the loci H19/Igf2.  The maternally-expressed H19 gene and paternally-expressed Igf2 gene share enhancers and their reciprocal imprinting is governed by a insulator that is located between the genes and which binds on the ICR and that is CTCF-dependent.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele several sites upstream of H 19 and the ICR remain unmethylated, this allowed that CTCF and its cofactors to bind. This interaction mediates enhancer blocking allowing downstream enhancers to access the H19 promoter. On the paternal allele, methylation at the ICR prevents CTCF binding and together with methylation at the H19 promoter allows the enhancers to access Igf2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In tumoral cells as are found  in Wilm’s tumor, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal profile, with a pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, thus promoting that IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, and causing increased cell growth. Because H19 functions to slow cell growth and IGF2 stimulates cell growth, loss of imprinting at the H19/IGF2 locus results in uncontrolled cell growth that can lead to tumor formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Aberrant DNA methylation, have been demonstrated to silence the expression of many genes that suppress malignancy. A possible therapeutic strategy is the use of DNA methylation inhibitors. Decitabine is a drug that inhibits DNA methylation. The incorporation of Decitabine  into DNA produces an inhibition of DNA methylation by the formation of a covalent bond between decitabine( deoxycytidine) and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT).Thus it is incorporated into DNA, where it produces an irreversible inactivation of DNA methyltransferase  acting specifically on S phase of the mitotic cycle. Decitabine is a potent antineoplastic agent against leukemia and tumors in animal models. Preliminary clinical trials have shown antineoplastic activity in patients with leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The demethylation of DNA by this analog in neoplastic cells can lead to the reactivation of silent tumor-suppressor genes, induction of differentiation or senescence, growth inhibition, and loss of clonogenicity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Environmental effects in one generation may be passed down to future generations, but the mechanism for this is not known. Drugs that are used to alter methylation status, act as external factors that may change methylation states for long periods of time. These time periods are subject to the number of mitotic divisions that occur. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return.</p>
<p>There are periods which the organism is more susceptible to epigenetic changes through environmental influences knowing as sensitive period (has undefined duration and is often associated with development and early life). Prenatal development represents the most vulnerable period for any exogenous interference, since a series events need to take place during this period in order to ensure normal tissue and organ development.</p>
<p>Although DNA methylation is involved in normal development, alterations of methylation in prenatal and early development have been associated with disease. Treating with drugs that alter DNA methylation state  in sensitive periods is foolish; this is because the risk of altering the normal development is high. A particular example treatments with endocrine disruptors which are related to psychopathologies.</p></div>
