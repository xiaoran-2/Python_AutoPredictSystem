    <div class="field-value"><p><em></em><em>CGIs are largely unmethylated so their promoters are active.  The more methylated the island becomes, the less active the promotor, therefore the genes are silenced. This is one way to regulate gene expression. Each cell silences genes not relevant to their function, like bone genes in an eye are turned off. This would be a normal function in development.  However if the CpG island that becomes methylated, (process where an enzyme like DNMT will add methyl groups to the cytosines) causes the silencing of the tumor suppressor gene, this can contribute a “hit” that can lead to cancer. Methylation is inheritable and the resulting cells have an advantage over others in their ability to reproduce as they bypass the built in check points of the cell cycle and evade destruction. </em></p>
<p>            <em> Repeats and ICRs  beyond the islands are mostly methylated and therefore silenced. This prevents illegitimate interactions and effects of transposons interrupting a gene sequence.  In cancer, this balance has been </em><strong><em>disrupted</em></strong><em>- as CGIs become more methylated,  these lose their methylation (these can involve lncRNAS,  recruitment of PCR2 and other histone modifiers also), contributing to genomic instability, possibly activating oncogenes or inhibiting the tumor suppressor genes.   Specific islands methylated and the repeats and  ICRs demethylated differ depending on tissue type and effect- loss or gain of function can occur. Without the tumor suppressor proteins, cells accumulate errors, are ineffective in DNA repair, dedifferentiate, and  proliferate in uncontrolled growth.  Cells that spend most of the time replicating are not performing their “jobs” (ex: fewer liver cells are processing toxins) therefore the individual will exhibit signs of </em><strong><em>disease.</em></strong><em>  These cancer cells can invade healthy tissue and metastasize. Since the cells pass on these epigenetic modifications to their daughter cells, these traveling cells can spread the disease by creating tumors in other tissue. </em></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>In the paternal allele the ICR of this cluster is hypermethylated, the CTCF insulator protein does not bind to it and the downstream enhancers can access the Igf2 and enhance its expression. This will cause methylation to spread to H19, thus silencing it. In the maternal allele this ICR is unmethylated , allowing methylation of insulator protein CTFC to bind to it, preventing access of the enhancers to lgf2.  They will instead enhance H19 expression. H19 expresses a lncRNA and acts as a tumor suppressor. </em><em>Wilm’s tumor i</em><em>s caused by errors in linked kcnq1 and h19/lgf2 regions on chromosome 11 and therefore a loss of cdnk1c (which inhibits cell growth through coding for a tumor suppressor) and over production of lgf2 (an oncogene). The abnormalities can be a mutation in this region on the maternal allele or disruption of DNA methylation imprints at the cluster.  Since the maternal allele now acts like the paternal one (uniparental disomy) in giving access to the enhancers , there is too much lgf2 expression, and not enough H19 expression,  leading to cancerous tumors as this oncogene promotes overgrowth of cells whereas the H19 product would have suppressed excess growth.</em></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>Decitabine is part of a group of DNA-Demethylating agents (DNMTI).  This drug is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. When used, they become  incorporated into the DNA and the then DNM transferase is irreversibly bound, thus  inhibiting the adding of the methyl group.   This changes the epigenome, which would then cause a possible block on the tumor suppressor genes to be removed and prevent the proliferation of the tumor cells.  While the article did not specify that Decitabine action had the same effects as acitidine, it may be inferred that it works the same way, as it is in the same group of DNMTI drugs.  It may be able to penetrate a solid tumor and weaken it enough to be susceptible to standard chemotherapy. </em></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>DNA methylation is</em> <em>inheritable. Therefore changes to the epigenetic marks by removing the methylation as the drug group DNMTI do or adding it will regulate and control of the genes around it, activating regions that have been switched off or vice versa. As the DNMTIs can cause irreversible DNMT binding and this epigenetic change could be passed on during replication to the cell line, whether the change is to directly methylate the DNA or possibly change histone acetylation, which can effect chromatin structure and seems to maybe have some relationship to the DNA methylation<sup>1</sup>. The sensitive periods are during the time of primordial germ cell development and during preimplatation. This is when the epigenetic marks are being erased and reset for next generation(s), if the drugs should cause them to set wrong, adding methylation in wrong places or interfering with the reset, removing imprinting, then all cells in that line would inherit errors and the drug could end up actually causing an inheritable disease instead of treating it.  </em><em><br /><em><sup>1</sup></em></em>Emerging connections between DNA methylation and histone acetylation. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Dobosy%20JR%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=11437233">Dobosy JR</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Selker%20EU%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=11437233">Selker EU</a> Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon, Eugene 97403, USA.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11437233"><strong>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11437233</strong></a></p></div>
