    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>An exemple of DNA methylation alteration in cancer</strong></p>
<p>On normal (healthy) cells, CpG islands, hypomethylated, are promoter for tumor suppressor genes. During cancer, the methylation of CpG island growth regularly. These methylation cause epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes. The silencing provoke inapropriate cellular growth, metastasis development and act differently in different tissues and cancer phases.</p>
<p> On healthy cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are, because their similarity, regions with a hight risk of harmful recombination. But these regions are methylated, cause densely packaging of DNA, and stabilize the physical structure of the genome. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are demethylated, the DNA is less packaging, and the probability of dangerous recombination growth. These DNA regions become more "adhesive", and the hypomethylation leads to deletions, translocations and insertions of DNA fragments between chromosomes. These events may activating cryptic promoters (and inapropriate gene expression) and break neighboring gene ( inapropriate Off). These alterations promote cancer development by chromosomal alterations.</p>
<p><strong>General situation</strong></p>
<p>Generally, DNA methylation are linked to cancer by two mechanism:</p>
<ul><li>locally hypermethylation of tumour supressor genes, leads to inactive these protectors genes</li>
<li>general hypomethylation of genome, leads to genetic instability and dangerous inter and intra chromosomic recombinations</li>
</ul><p>The relative importance of this effects is context, tumour and time dependant.</p></div>

<ul>

        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>How Decitabine may be used to treat cancer</strong></p>
<p>Some drugs, based on epigenetics effects, are studied against cancer. They are:</p>
<ul><li>inhibitors of histone methylation enzymes</li>
<li> histone-deacetylase inhibitors </li>
<li>inhibitors for myc activating genes </li>
<li>two molecules, azacitidine and Decitabine, that are DNA-demethylating agents.</li>
</ul><p>The neoplasic DNA, overmethylated, is the target of decitabine, a cytidine analog and inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p>Decitabine act on DNA, by inhibit the methylation on wide genome when the tumoral cell DNA copying. The tumoral overmethylation is tumor dependent, and decitabine is used against myelodysplastic syndromes (where decitabine leads to a <span>hypomethylation of target gene promoters)</span>.</p>
<p>More, is it possible that, like azacitine, decitabine made tumour cells more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p>
<p>More, the epigenetic state is mitosis transmitted, also the eventually daughter cells of the tumor are "treated", demethylated, healthy cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Tumoural cells have a genome widely overmethylated, promoting genetic disorders expanding tumour: oncogenes expression, protectors genes inhibition, loss of apoptotic mechanisms, overgrowth... Before tumoral cell divide, DNA is copying and this overmethylation is copied also: new cells are tumoural, abnormal cells; with a potential characteristic for resisting to some other chemotherapy drugs.</p>
<p>Some epigenetic drugs inhibit tumoural DNA methylation when is copied , and the new cells obtained are normally methylated: the expression of harmfull gene decrease, and daughters cells are sensitive to a standard chemotherapy. More, even that demethylated stade is mitotically heritable, the effect of epigenetic drugs persist without drugs, because new cells stay demethylated.</p>
<p>But this epigenetic drugs, like other chemotherapy, are hazardous: act in all organism, even during a period when the normal methylation stade of cells, specially gamets, are changing (when epigenetic marks are established). These sensitive periods occurs during gametogenesis (spermatogenesis on adult life in man, primordial germ cells formation in female embryo) and in embryo at blastocyst state. </p>
<p>During sensitive periods, treating patients cause several genetic disorders (abnormal imprinting, normal methylation is perturbated) in eventual embryos (woman) and gametes. However, epigenetic treatment is chemotherapy component, often dangerous for embryos (and gametes).</p></div>
