    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark involving the covalent transfer of a methyl group to the C-5 position of the cytosine ring of DNA by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).<sup><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip jig-ncbipopper" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3174260/#bibr1-1947601910393957">1</a></sup></p>
<p>(1) The normal function of DNA methylation does not normally occur at the CpG island. What normally occurs there, it is a hypomethylation. The gene is methylated in 3 regions: repetitive element (RE); intergenic region (IR) and in the introns of genes (inG).</p>
<p>(2) Firstly, at the islands, DNA methylation becomes more dense. With the presence of cancer, the cancer cell will  have a higher chance of being methylated( not all) but a great number. The other 3 regions will be hypomethylated : RE, IR and inG)</p>
<p>(3) Secondly (the GpG island being at the tumor supressor genes), DNA methylation will contribute at the disease by the incapacitation of performing its function: the ability of locking down silencing the Tumour supressor together with a oncogene (according to Knudson hypothesis). DNA methylation is heritable and if it is silenced/inactive or hitted tumorogenesis may occur.</p>
<p>(4)Thirdly, its normal function in IR and RE is that of the regions are methylated  and the GpC island will be unmethylated</p>
<p>(5)  On the other hand, in a tumour cell, the regions above mentioned will be hypomethylated and the GpC island is methylated</p>
<p>(6) Being found at the tumour supressor genes, the disruption of it cause a genetically or epigenetically inability of inactivating/silencing the tumour supressor genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>(1) There will be a hypermathylation at the ICR (inpriting control region)- can cause a loss of imprinting. Lots of genes are involved in growth (either promoting or surpessing).</p>
<p>At the paternal allele (depending on the gene and location it can occur hyper or hyp methylation), using the example of the class, the following can occur:  at the IR, methylated, there will be no binding by the CTCF and consequent enhancement of the IgI2 (no expression of H19).</p>
<p>On the other hand, at the maternal allele, there will be an enhacement of H19 (and binding of CTCF), and the consequent silencing of IgI2</p>
<p>However, with the loss of imprinting, there will be complications:</p>
<ul><li>At the maternal allele there will be expression of Igl2 causing it to be a double dose of Igl2!</li>
<li>Lastly, Being it a growth promoter its consequence will be Wilms´ tumour. It occurs in a very early stage.Still,  these events of hypo and hyper methylations occur in a very early stage (pre neoplastic tissue) which can be checked before theres a conclusion of it is a tumour or not.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>(1) The class of the EI are:</p>
<ul><li>DNMT: Histone- Deacetylase</li>
</ul><p>(2) Impact causes:</p>
<ul><li>It is being used for the treatment of rare illness- eg. cutaneous T-cell lymphoma</li>
<li>slow tumour growth</li>
<li>successful result on the fight agains solid tumour</li>
</ul><p>(3) Mechanism:</p>
<ul><li>it penetrates the cancer making the tumorous cell change in ways that make them more suceptible to other tratments like standard chemotherapy, for example.</li>
<li>It acts epigenetically by altering the passing on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively eliminated. After elimination are erased permanently. There are suppositions that the epigenetic therapies can effect alterations which stop a cancer growing without having to destroy it all its affected cells.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>(1) The epigenome of Tumorous cells show several changes in comparison to the epigenome of the normal. Alternations on DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. Consequently we have: <em><strong>genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes</strong></em>.Also there is a silencing of tumor suppressor genes (controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair) by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands.Changes in the cancer epigenome might result from mistargeting or altered composition of epigenetic complexes.</p>
<p>(2) Sensitive period: every cell could still be affected by the drugs so the period for the application of the drug has got to be correct or else it can cause more damage then that one expects.</p>
<p>(3)SP of development:For younger patients, which still have developing germ cells</p>
<p>(4) It is extremely dangerous because the use of the drugs involves the whole body and the wrong application can jeopardize the epigenetic machinary</p>
