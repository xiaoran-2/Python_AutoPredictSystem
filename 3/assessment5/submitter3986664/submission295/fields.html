    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a very important factor for correct gene activation or silencing. Regions in the mammalian genome where CpG dinucleotides are found are called CpG islands, and the area around them - CpG shores. They tend to be unmethylated for gene activation since CpG islands are usually located at the promoters of genes where RNA binds to create copies of the DNA for cell replication. In cancer, CpG islands and shores are hypermethylated around tumour-suppressing genes. This inactives the tumour-suppressing genes which leads to abnormal cell proliferation. Disruption of methylation at CpG islands can lead to a variety of diseases since the methylation can block "good" genes (like a tumour suppressor) from being expressed.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is achieved by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) and demethylation by demethylases. It is important that DNMT can silence intergenic regions and repetitive elements in the genome to avoid transposition and transcriptional errors and interference, since these regions can in fact lead to genomic instability via illegitimate recombination of nucleotide bases. If these regions were unmethylated, then this could lead to cancer and other diseases. These transcriptional "errors" could code for prolonged lifespan of a cell which could pass on defective information mitotically to daughter cells which leads to the formation of tumours through cell proliferation.</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation can also lead to other diseases like Rett's syndrome which is a result of an error in X inactivation in cells. X inactivation is important in female mammals for dosage compensation since they inheirit two X chromosomes from their mother and their father. One of the X chromosomes is silenced (either by random or via imprinted epigenetic information) via methylation. If it is not, it can lead to a variety of syndromes as a result of two active X chromosomes in cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic reprogramming important so cells can differentiate into different types for different functions during development. Epigenetic marks need to be cleared betweern generations so that totipotency of the cells can be restored. Methylation patterns of the paternal and maternal allele differ during development. In early development, methylation marks are rapidly and actively removed in the paternal genome, and passively removed in the maternal genome. In primordial germ cell development, there is differential resetting of marks during sperm and oocyte development depending on the sex of the fetus.</p>
<p>In the paternal allele, Igf2 expression is usually silenced, and in the maternal allele it is usually activated. Loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can cause abnormalities. Bechwith Wiedermann Syndrome is caused by an imprinting disorder, where the maternal allele behaves like a paternal allele and the H19/Igf2 cluster is activated. This can cause Wilm's tumour in affected children since Igf2 is a growth promoter (Igf2 is upregulated).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, it acts by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Hypermethylation at CpG islands is very common in tumours. Regions of the the DNA which have tumour suppressor genes are silenced, therefore promoting the overproliferation of cells. Decitabine would remove those methylation marks, activating tumour suppressor genes and, hopefully, reversing the cancer or stopping it in its tracks.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation marks can have long-lasting effects on the epigenome because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. This means that when a cell divides via mitosis, it would pass on these methylation marks to daughter cells. This will go on and on unless a certain drug is administered to alter DNA methylation.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are preiods of epigenetic reprogramming (during early developments and primordial germ cell development). Removing or altering the normal reprogramming process can result in epigenetic abnormalities. As seen in IVF, there is a high risk of disrupted epigenetic resetting, since oocytes and sperm are removed from the optimal environment, fertilised egg cells cultured in vitro, and subsequently handled and harvested before being placed into a uterus. This can result in birth defects and diseases.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the drugs that are being administered could have long-lasting drastic effects on DNA methylation marks which could result in more diseases.</p></div>
