    <h1>Submission 817 from Anon (session_user_id: 534b052aa3723aade3026acd476b64e512446087)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is classified as DNA demethylating agent, in which the target is DNA methylation in cancer cells.<br /> In cancer cells, there are high levels of DNA methylation, which promotes growth of the cell (for instance, Igf2) and suppress tumour genes (such as Cdkn1e). The chemicals from the drug penetrates into the cancerogenous cell and indirectly removes the methyl group from cytosine (one of the base pairs in DNA) in the promoters by blocking DNMTs (enzymes that maintain DNA methylation). Once DNMTs are blocked, the DNA gradually lose methylation, in which stops to maintain overgrowth of tumour cells and stops to silencing tumour suppressors genes. Eventually the cell that once had high levels of DNA methylation starts to die due to decrease in DNA methylation and therefore a lack of stability and functionality. Hence, the levels of DNA methylation will be reestablished throughout the genome and the tumour will be contained.<br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the CpG islands are not methylated in order to keep the gene expressed. In a cancer cell, the CpG islands suffer a hypermethylation process due to a progress in age and epigenetics mistakes throughout the life (for instance, an abnormal increase of DNMT1 in CpG islands, which the function is to maintain DNA methylation). Hypermethylation in CpG islands jeopardise its function, which leads to silencing of the gene expression. This disruption cause genes such as tumour suppressor genes to be silenced, and therefore no cells will be made to defeat the abnormal ones (carcinogenic cells). This issue (methylation of CpG islands) will be passed through daughter cells due to mitotical heritability of DNA methylation.<br />Conversely to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells whereas in cancer cells are not. A ordinary intergenic region and repetitive elements are methylated in order to mantain genomic stabilty/integrity (the methylated silences the cryptic transcription start sites and prevents transposition). However, in a cancer cell, both intergenic region and repetitive elements suffer hypomethylation (in other words, become unmethylated) by the same reason as CpG hypermethylation process occurs: progress in age and epigenetic failures. The consequence of hypomethylation in intergenic region and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability (given that the former and the latter will become actively expressed), creating abnormal karyotype such as deletions, reciprocal translocation and insertions throughtout the genome.<br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In H19/Igf2 cluster, the maternal allele has Igf2 silenced, whereas H19 is expressed. Also, the imprint control region (ICR) is unmethylated and is binded to CTCF, which is an insulator protein, that insulates Igf2 from being expressed by the enhancers. In paternal allele the opposite occurs: Igf2 is expressed while H19 is silenced. The former is expressed because the enhancers are able to access the promoter, due to the methylation in ICR paternal allele and therefore cannot bind with CTCF. In addition, the ICR's methylation spreads to H19 promoters silencing it, which allows the activation of Igf2. <br />In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele acts in the same way as the paternal. Both alleles show a methylated ICR which leads to a overexpression of Igf2 and underexpression of H19 (the maternal allele suffers a hypermethylation of ICR which does not bind with CTCF protein anymore and therefore the Igf2 is not silenced). <br />It is known that Igf2 is a growth promoter in which in a wrong dose (the Wilm's tumour has twice the normal dosage) promotes an overgrowth of the cells and therefore instability in the genome. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, which means the daughter cells will have the same DNA methylation patterns as the mother cell. Once the DNA methylation in the cell is altered by the drug, this will be passed on through daughter cell and <span>granddaughter </span>cells and so on, until the epigenetic marks are actively erased. This happens twice and is known as the sensitive periods. The epigenetic marks are first erased in primordial germ cell development and secondly in early embryonic development. The period that a person is treated with epigenetic drugs is crucial in order to not jeopardise the next generation. If treating a person with the epigenetic drugs during the sensitive period, the epigenetic marks will be reset and mistaken epigenetic marks will lie down due to the alterations caused by the drug - rather than resetting and lying down the common epigenetic marks. Therefore, the germ cell or embryo might be damaged.<br /> For instance, if a person is treated with a demethylation agent during the sensitive period, the drug might interfere in the reprogramming process by altering and damaging the reestablishment of epigenetic marks, giving a lack of DNA methylation in developing germ or embryonic cells.</p></div>
