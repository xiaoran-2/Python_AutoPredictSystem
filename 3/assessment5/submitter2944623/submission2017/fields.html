    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to suppress oncogenes. DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer by becoming hypermethylated. Hypermethylation of the CpG islands in the promoter of tumor suppressor genes can lead to tumor growth. The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions of repetitive elements is to increase genomic stability by preventing illigitament recombination of repeat, and activation of repeats, transposition and cryptic promoters. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements, in cancer, become hypomethylated. This decreases genomic stability causing deactivation of tumor suppressors and activation of oncogenes resulting in cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele is methylated Igf2 is expressed. The maternal allele is not methylated Igf2 is not expressed. In the maternal allele, CTCF, an insulator protein, blocks Igf2 from downstream enhancers. In the paternal allele, DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding. Without CTCF, DNA methylation allows the enhancers to activate Igf2. In Wilm's tumour, H19 is methylated in both the paternal and maternal allele causing Igf2 to be expressed in both alleles. Disrupted imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can cause under expression of growth restriction genes and over expression of growth promoting genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to is the demethylating agents. The impact Decitabine has on DNA methylation is it  demethylates. Decitabine can demethylate tumor supressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because daughter cells can inherit methylation through DNMT1. Sensitive period is when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control. The sensitive periods of development are from the development of premodial germ cells to the development of gametes and gametes to the epiblast. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the effects of epigenetic changes would be greater and could potential effect their children.</p></div>
