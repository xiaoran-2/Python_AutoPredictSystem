    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p> In cancer, DNA methylation may be disrupted. This happens in two ways:  DNA hypermethylation, which is locus specific; and genome wide hypomethylation .Typically in cancer, global methylation decreases but CpG island methlyation increases as the cancer progresses from normal tissue to neoplaysia to metastasis (invasion).  Each aspect will be discussed separately below.</p>
<p>DNA Hypermethylation:  DNA methylation at CpG islands exists throughout a normal genome, and  a methylated CpG island is associated with repression of expression of that gene. In cells where expression of the gene is desired, CpG islands are normally not methylated.</p>
<p>In cancer, more CpG islands become methylated and thus the expression of these genes are repressed.  The identity of hypermethylated islands varies with type of cancer.  One example is gene BRCA1 in breast cancer. </p>
<p>Often times in cancer, it is CpG islands associated with tumor suppressors that are methlylated.  This silences the tumor suppressor genes, and thus allows tumors to grow.  DNA methylation is a strong epigenetic mark and is mitotically heritable, so as the cells divide more rapidly and the new cells also have the tumor suppressor gene silenced, the tumor grows.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DNA Hypomethylation:  As cancer progresses, genome wide hypomethylation  is observed, and the hypomethylation takes place in repeats and intergenic regions. In a normal cell, the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are methlyated but in cancer, they become unmethylated.  Such hypomethlyation happens early and progresses with time.</p>
<p>Genome wide hypomethylation leads to genomic instability. These regions are usually methlyated to prevent expression and keep them in heterochromatin.  If these regions become hypomethlyated, the genome becomes unstable and can have illegitimate recombinations - deletions, reciprocol translocations, insertions.  The repeats could also become active and  jump around the genome or could activate neighboring genes - like agouti yellow allele example.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells exhibit loss of imprinting - cells that should be showing mono-allelic, parent of origin expression have lost this imprinting and either express from both alleles or are silent.  This is important for cancer because imprinting is related to growth. The result could be either loss of expression of growth genes or increased expression of growth promoting genes.  It happens early and can be seen in pre-neoplastic tissue.</p>
<p>Example of H19/Igf2:  In a normal cell, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele, and unmethylated on the maternal allele. As the paternal allele is methylated at the ICR, enhancers act on Igf2 and it will produce Igf2.  As the maternal allele not methylated at the ICR, CTCF will bind at the ICR, causing enhancers to act on H19 and thus no Igf2 is produced.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm's tumor, there is hyper methlyation; thus both the maternal and paternal alleles are methylated.  In this case, CTCF does not bind to either and therefore Igf2 is produced from both the maternal and paternal allele, resulting in increased Igf2 production.  Igf2 is growth promoting, and the result is a childhood kidney tumor (Wilms tumor).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The potential application of drugs to modify epigenetics is a field which is just developing.  The concept behind these treatment is that by modifying epigenetic marks such as methylation and acetylation, expression of certain genes can be either turned on or turned off, potentially correcting the cancerous behaviour of the cells.  There are several groups of epigenetic drugs, including histone deacetylase inhibitors, demethylating agents, transcription factors, and others. </p>
<p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  The objective is to reduce hypermethylation of CpG islands, which had suppressed activity of tumor suppressor genes.   If the hypermethylation is reduced, then expression of the tumor suppressor genes may return, thus stopping growth of or even reducing the size of tumors.  As methylation marks are mitotically heritable, this treatment has the potential to stop cancer ( tumor growth) without having to kill all of the existing tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so any treatment that modifies DNA methylation is passed on from parent to daugher cells and onwards.  Thus, the effects of any epigenetic drug that actively alters DNA methylation states can have enduring effects on the epigenome. </p>
<p>Use of such drugs should be avoided during sensitive periods of development.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is when there is active reprogramming of epigenetic marks. There are two sensitive periods with respect to epigentic control:  primordial germ cell development to production of mature sperm/egg cell development; and from pre-implantation and early post-implantation development period. </p>
<p>In practice, the period to be avoided would be the time period just prior to expected pregnancy and early pregnancy (although good practice may exclude treatment during pregnancy in its entirety).</p>
<p>Treating patients during such sensitive periods is not advisable because any external influences (eg drug treatment)  during this sensitive period of reprogramming may disrupt the epigenetic reprogramming, potentially resulting in unforeseen and unexpected epigenetic changes.  This could result in disease or other abnormalities; and any changes during the sensitive period may have transgenerational effects.</p>
