    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in mammals occurs at CpG islands dinucleotides, which are citosines followed by guanines bonded by a phosphate group and added to DNA. Since dinucleotides are symmetrical, methylation is maintained during cell division. When the cell divides only one parent strand with the methyl group is going to be kept, so to make up for this hemi-methylation the methyltransferase DNMT1 lays down methylation on the daughter strand that lacks it. In every cell division methylation will be copied onto the daughter strand and this is why it is a stable epigenetic mark.</p>
<p>CpG islands are found at gene promoters and are generally unmethylated, but if they are methylated, then the gene will be silenced, which is another epigenetic mark. In the case of cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated and will be found in tumour suppressor genes. This is because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. This epimutation will allow the tumour suppressor silencing cells to divide more rapidly and live longer. The upside to DNA hypermthylation of these CpG islands is that it is reversible and can thus be reversed with therapeutic treatment.</p>
<p>While in a normal cell intergenic intervals and repetitive elements are methylated, in a cancer cell they are hypomethylated. Hypomethylation is seen abundantly in repeats, which disrupts genome stability causing illegitimate recombination of repeats, wrong transposals, or their promoters may activate genes that should be kept silent and there may be deletions, insertions, duplications and reciprocal translocations between chromosomes. This tends to happen in almost every tumour and at a very early stage of tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In imprint control regions (ICR) DNA methylation is not necessarily a synonym of gene silencing. A methylated ICR will show whether it is maternally or paternally imprinted. For instance, the H19/Idf2 cluster is paternally imprinted because the ICR on the paternal chromosome is methylated. The unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele is bound by an insulator protein called CTCF, which insulates Igf2 thus allowing downstream enhancers to promote expression of H19 instead of Igf2. Therefore, H19 is expressed on the maternal allele. On the other hand, CTCF is methylated on the paternal allele and cannot insulate Igf2, therefore downstream enhancers promote Igf2 expression, whereas H19 is inactive due to heterochromatin spreading or DNA methylation spreading.</p>
<p>Individuals with Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome have an overexpression of Igf2 on the paternal allele and this causes them to be predisposed to suffer embryonic or childhood tumours. A commonly discussed example is Wilm’s tumour, which is found in the kidney. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is the commercial name for azacitidine. It is a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor, which means that it induces DNA demethylation. It is mainly used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and in combination with a histone-deacetylase inhibitor, it slows tumour growth in some lung cancers.</p>
<p>The DNMT1 inhibitor Decitabine uses for DNA demethylation is activated during cell replication, which means it is particularly successful in cancer cells because they divide much more rapidly. Due to the mitotic heritability of DNA methylation, once Decitabine succeeds in reversing methylation this epigenetic mark is likely to remain stable in future cell divisions, thus allowing for a sustained expression of tumour suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As stated in my previous answer, since DNA methylation can be reversed by the chemical action of azacitidine and it is mitotically heritable, hypomethylation is going to be sustainably replicated on and on with each cell division.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are the intervals of epigenetic reprogramming during which epigenetic marks seem to be more sensitive to changes in the environment (for example, IVF, changes in diet).  The first one takes place during development of primordial germ cells into gametes, and the second one during embryonic pre- and early post-implantation when there is an active remodelling of the epigenome.  </p>
<p>Administering drugs that alter the epigenetic machinery during sensitive periods would be a major insult to the environment and it could negatively affect epigenetic reprogramming as it is the time when the correct imprinting of genes and the balance of DNA methylation are in progress.  </p></div>
