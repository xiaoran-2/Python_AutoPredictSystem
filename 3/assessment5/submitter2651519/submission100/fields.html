    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in CpG islands generally silence genes that are methylated. 5-methyl-citosyne is generated by DNA methyltranferases and it is a heritable epigenetic mark. DNA methylation in CpG islands principally occurs on promoter regions.<span> DNA methylation is generated by </span><span class="highlight">DNA methyltransferase</span><span> (DNMT) 1 and the de novo methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT. </span><span class="highlight">DNA</span><span> methylation, catalyzed by the DNMTs, plays an important role in maintaining genome stability. Cancer is associated to <span>acquisition of abnormal genetic and / or epigenetic changes. </span></span>In cancer, general genome is hypomethylated and DNA hypermethylation occurs on tumour suppressor genes and this genes are silenciated, this contribute to disease. Futhermore, methylated CpG islands progress with the tumour and they are high at the cancer invasion, so it can be useful like a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis. In normal function of DNA, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated, but in cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. The <span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">consequence</span> of hypomethylation depends on location: in repeats or CpG poor promoters. In CpG poor promotores, the hyphomethylation allows different oncogen activation. In addition, the hypomethylation of repeats and intervals regions generate a genomic inestability  and produce illegitimate genome recombination, insertion, deletions, and reciprocal translocation. These genome modifications can <span>alter gene function and malignant cellular transformation and it <span>result in chromosomal instability and increased mutation events, contributing to cancer development (initiation and progression).</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinted gene expression would be modificated in cancer too. IgF2/H19 imprinted cluster of gene are differential methylated. In maternal allele the insulator protein (CTCF) bind to ICR and this allele is not methylated, so, the distal enhances can activate the H19 gene in the maternal allele and IgF2 expression is silence. In another hand, in the paternal allele, the ICR, H19 gene are methylated, CTCF don´t bind at the genome and the enhancer activate the IgF2 expression. Then, the imprinted gene expression allows differential maternal and paternal expression. In Wilm´s tumour there are a hypermethylation of two parental alleles and the IgF2 expression is enhanced twice of its normal levels. The hypermethylation of ICR don´t allow CTCF bind and the distal enhancer acts on IgF2 and not over H19 gene. In Wilm´s tumour <span>H19 expression is decreased and there is a Igf2 over expression. The lost of imprinted gene expression <span>is <span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">possibly</span> permissive for Wilm´s tumorigenesis.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA demethylating agents, it acts like a DNMT inhibitor. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that can irreversibly bind to DNMTs after is incorporated into DNA, it is replication dependent. Decitabine produce a decrease of DNA methylation. It can incorporated into the DNA replication and when DNMT comes to bind it, DNMT bind that nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand and bound irreversibly. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent. Cancer cells are dividing more rapidly than other cells in the body, so cancer cells will be more affected. In cancer, hypermethylation of promotor DNA produces the inhibition of tumour suppressor gene transcription and it is involved in cancer progression. Decitabine affects DNA methylation blocking tumours progression: The therapeutic with DNA demethylating agents generate an enhance of transcription factors and these can modify gene expession having antitumour effect. Epigenetics modifications by drugs will be hereditable.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>For definition, epigenetic are modifications on the genome that not involve mutations. Epigenetic marks are reversible. DNA methylation is produced for DNA methyltransferases, these enzymes generate hereditable methylation and produce mehylation <em>de novo. </em>Also, DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome during epigenic reprograming occurs. However, epigenetic marks occur on a sensitive period, in this specific period the epigenetic mechanism is activated. The periods when epigenetic drugs should be avoided are the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development. On this time of zygote development, the maternal genome is passively demethylated and the paternal genome is actively demethylated and imprinted genes are resistant to epigenetic reprogramming during early embryonic development, but they do undergo epigenetic reprogramming in primordial germ cells. So, is important to be careful when a young patient will be treating because epigenetic drugs could impact on his germ cells and in pregnant women (zygote development).</p></div>
