    <h1>Submission 1566 from Anon (session_user_id: 3cd2cf9b025985db16c41527fa14f4d770136cb4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug currently used for treating myelodysplastic syndromes (bone marrow syndromes) which if left untreated might progress to become leukemias. It is a DNA demethylating agent and a cytidine analog and hence acts like the normal DNA base cytosine. Because of its resemblance to cytosine, Decitabine can be incoprorated into DNA and here it irrevesibly binds to DNA methyltransferases inhibiting DNA methylation. Because of this, Decitabine counters the effect seen in most cancers of DNA hypermethylation especially hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes which causes them to silenced leading to cell control deregulation. By interfering with the DNA methylation process, Decitabine restores the normal function of tumour suppresor genes hence restoring control over cell control. Decitabine is also an antimetabolite and once incorporated into rapidly diving cells becomes toxicto the cells  leading to cell death especially death of cancer cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are mitotically inherited. As DNA methyation is an epigentic mark it can also be passed to daughter and granddaughter cells ensuring that they  behave like the parental cells as they have the same epigenome. By altering the DNA methylation status of a cancer cell for example theoretically the new status of the cell would be passed on to the new cells and in this sense the effects could be long lasting. However the epigenome of cells is actively cleared during primodial germ cell development and during embryogenesis. These periods are known as sensitive periods as these are periods when old marks are erased and new marks are laid down. Important processes like gene imprinting happen at these stages as well. Treating patients during these periods would be inadvisable because the effect of the drug would be erased and also this might interefere with the imprinting patterns of genes and introduce aberrant epigenome patterns..</p>

    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the hallmarks of cancer is activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes achieved genetically and epigenetically. One of the most studied epigenetic changes in cancer is the role of DNA methylation, a heritable epigenetic modification that occurs on carbon 5 of the DNA cytosine base. DNA methylation is involved in imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and heterochromatin formation and is catalysed by DNA methyltransferases. Interestingly CpG islands in promoter regions of housekeeping genes and tumour suppressor genes are hypomethylated allowing expression of these genes. In cancer, hypomethylation of these genes is changed such that they become hypermethylated leading to their silencing. This change is brought about due to either loss of fidelity or mutation of the DNA methyltransferases making them behave differently. This phenomenon is most noticed in CpG islands associated with promoter regions of tumour suppresor genes which are involved in cell cycle regulation. These genes become hypermethylated and silenced leading to aberant cell proliferation and cancer as the cells entry into mitosis is deregulated. Aberant proliferation of cells is also usually accomapnied by defects in the cells DNA repair machinery and mutations occuring during DNA replication might not be rectified. Notable examples of hypermethylated genes related to cancer are retinoblastoma (eye cancer) and BRCA1(breast cancer) genes.</p>
<p><br />DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive repeats leads to genome stability and prevents spurious migration of repetitive elements in the genome. If this happens the repetitive elements might insert themselves at a gene locus causing that gene to become an oncogene which might lead to cancer. However in cancer there is a global hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This has the effect of causing transposable elements to become active contributing to genomic instability seen in cancer cells.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting results in allelic exclusion of gene expression. This charactestic is restricted to certain loci or to certain developmental stages. One of the imprinted locus studied in relation to cancer is that of the H19/Igf2 cluster made of up of Insulin growth like factor 2 coding of insulin (promotes growth) and H19 gene coding for a lncRNA (slows growth). Normally the paternal allele is methylated on H19 allele. Methylation of H19 blocks binding of CTFT to the imprint control region controlling this cluster, allowing interaction of Igf2 promoter with distal enhancers leading to Igf2 expression. On the maternal allele the H19 is unmethylated allowing CTFT to bind to the control region. CTFT blocks the interaction of distal enhancers with Igf2 resulting in no Igf2 expression. The enhancers then instead interact with H19 leading to formation of a lncRNA which also suppresses Igf2 expression.<br />In Wilm's tumour there is loss of imprinting on the maternal allele such that it gains H19 DNA methylation and ends up behaving like a paternal allele. Also because of the maternal DNA methylation of H19, there is no production of the lncRNA which suppresses Igf2 expression. This leads to over production of Igf2, a growth hormone, and to increased cell proliferation and to tumorigenesis. </p></div>
