    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. DNA methylation at CpG islands can inhibit(silence) the gene at its vicinity..</p>
<p>2. There are often hypermethylation of CpG islands in cance.</p>
<p>3. DNA methylation inhibits(silence) tumor suppressor gene in the vicinity and contribute to abnormal cell growth.</p>
<p>4. DNA methylation at intergenetic and repetitive elements helps stability of DNA (genes) in that region.</p>
<p>5 There are DNA hypomethylation(demethylation) at intergenetic and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>6. DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can cause oncogene avtivation and genomic instability, such as illigitimate recombination, activation of repeats and transpositions and activation of cryptic promotors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. Paternal allele is methylated, and there is expression of lgf2  gene.</p>
<p>2. Maternal allele is demethylated, and there is hypo-expression (no expression) of lgf2 gene.</p>
<p>3. In Wilm's tumor, there is hypermethylation of ICR of H19/lgf2 cluster, and lgf2 over-expression.</p>
<p>4. Hypermethylation at ICR causes overexpression of lgf2, which is a growth promoting gene, and causes tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent.</p>
<p>2. Decitabine causes demethylation of CpG islands.</p>
<p>3. By demethylating CpG island, Decitabine activates the tumor suppressor gene, and suppreses tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable.</p>
<p>2. Period of time in the life of organism when the cells are sensitive to epigenetic altenation, resulting in permenant damage to the organism.</p>
<p>3. The sensitive periods are during gonade formation (miosis) and early fetus formation.</p>
<p>4. Treatment during the sensitive periods could permanently alter the epigenetic apparatus and damages the development the the organism.</p></div>
