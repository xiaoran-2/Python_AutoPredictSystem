    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, DNA methylation patterns undergo complex changesThere are two types of DNA methylation abnormalities. First of all there's DNA hypermethylation that is locus-specific. And secondly, there's genome-wide hypomethylation. In a normal cell, what you see is a hypomethylated CpG island. So, you don't see methylation in general at CpG islands. But you find that the genome in general is methylated in the repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and indeed, even in the introns of genes as shown here. In contrast, if you look in general at a cancer cell, now the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. They're not all methylated, but their more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell. , in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become</p>
<p>hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. In cancer cells, the rest of the genome in general including the repetitive elements, and  these intergenic elements and indeed the introns are hypomethylated, which causes genomic instability. So, the critical difference between  hypermethylation of a CpG island and as a way to inactivate a tumor suppressor gene  in comparison to a genetic mutation is that these epimutations. The DNA hypermethylation is reversible. And this is really important because if these, if this hypermethylation, this DNA methylation, DNA methylation is occurring frequently in cancer and has caught some consequence for the cell, but it is reversible.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer.The maternally-expressed H19 gene and paternally-expressed Igf2 gene share enhancers and their reciprocal imprinting is governed by a CTCF-dependent insulator that is located between the genes. On the paternal chromosome, methylation at the ICR (imprinting control regions) not only prevents CTCF from binding, allowing Igf2 to engage the enhancers, but it is also required formethylation at the H19 promoter and silencing of H19. CTCF is an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers and DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding, without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate, this could generate upregulation of Igf2 (oncogene, growth promoting). On the maternal allele in mouse, CTCF binds to 4 binding sites within the ICR, generating an insulator that prevents Igf2 from accessing the shared enhancers thatare located on the H19 side of the insulator. Thus, the insulator effectively acts as an enhancer-blocker. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of the DNA-demethylating agents, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, and it is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. The drug acts as an inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferases (DNMTs) and existing evidence indicates that DNMT1 appears to be responsible for maintenance of established patterns of methylated DNA, while DNMT-3a and -3b seem to mediate de novo DNA methylation patterns. Interestingly DNMT1 alone is not sufficient for maintenance of abnormal gene hypermethylation but the cooperation with DNMT3b must occur for this function. The mechanisms are partially mediated by the hypomethylation of DNA with cytotoxic effects documented at higher concentrations .The net effect is the modulation of specific genes involved in cellular processes such as apoptosis, cytostasis, differentiation and tumor angiogenesis. It is not surprising that DNMT inhibitors are promising drugs in cancer treatment, especially in combination with other agents or with other treatments like radiotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation almost exclusively occurs at CpG dinucleotides in mammals on a symmetrical form, so able to be maintained through cell division, and it can leads silencing of the gene by two mechanisms: the first is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure and the second is that the methylation can prohibit transcription factor binding, and alter gene expression. A sensitive period is a period when epigenetic marks are actively remodeled, like early development and primordial germ cell development. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because at the sensitive period, the cells are already in division, so we have to treat the patients before this because unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p></div>
