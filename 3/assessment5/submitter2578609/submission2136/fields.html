    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Typically, CpG islands are used to control the expression of a gene epigentically---either by silencing the gene (methylated) or allowing it to be expressed (unmethylated). However, in cancer, the CpG island may be atypically methylated/unmethylated. This can lead to the silencing of tumour supression genes, or to the activation of oncogenes.</p>
<p>Additionally, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are also normally methylated. This prevents incorrect recombination between chromosomes (i.e.: mismatched chromosomes, or at the incorrect position on the chromosome) at the site of repetitive elements. It also supresses transposons, and cryptic promoter sites in intergenic regions (which may disrupt nearby genes). In cancer, these intergenic regions and repetitive elements may be hypomethylated, resulting in an abnormal karyotype and gene disruption, either leading to loss-of-function in tumour suppressor genes, loss of supression of oncogenes, or misfunctioning genes which become oncogenic.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>An example of how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer is the igf2 gene involved in Wilm's tumour. Normally, the ICR on the paternal is methylated, allowing downstream enhancers to act on the igf2 gene of the paternal allele, whereas on the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind, insulating the igf2 gene from the enhancers, and causing them to act on the h19 gene.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, this imprinting is disrupted---the maternal ICR is also methylated, meaning CTCF is unable to bind. This results in expression of both the paternal and maternal igf2 genes, and neighter h19 gene. Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene, and this double dose of Igf2 results in a kidney tumour in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>An example of cancer medication that acts epigenetically is Decitabine. It is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, and works by blocking the activity of DNA methyltransferase. It is a nucleoside analogue, and is incorporated into the DNA. The Decitabine analogue then irreversibly binds DMNT, preventing further methylation of DNA as it is replicated (and thereby demethylating genes hypermethylated in cancer). By demethylating tumour suppressor genes, Decitabine can result in reversion of the cell to a more "normal" state, and consequently a reduction in tumour cell size and quantity, especially in metastatic tumours or myelomas (myelodysplastic syndrome).[1]</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During DNA synthesis, DNA methylation patterns are passed to daughter DNA molecules by DNA methyltransferase. This allows epigentic marks to be passed to daughter cells, and on throughout the cell lineage until the marks are removed. These marks therefore have the ability to affect daughter cells indefinitely, until they are erased.</p>
<p>However, there are also sensitive periods of development during periods of patient development where the epigenetic marks of the cells are more susceptible to change. Two major sensitive periods in humans include embryonic stem cell devleopment and germ cell development (i.e.: during gestation for the patient, or during adolescence for their germ cells and by extension their offspring).</p>
<p>Consequently, patients should not be treated with epigenetically-active drugs at all during pregnancy, and extreme caution should be used in adolescence, in order to protect their children. Additionally, the "slow-growth period" in children is an epigentically sensitive period for the germ cells, and epigenetic treatment should be avoided to prevent complications for their offspring (i.e.: 9--12 in boys, and 8--10 in girls, and also the perinatal and infanthood periods for girls).</p></div>
