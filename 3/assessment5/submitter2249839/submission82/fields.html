    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is  a :</p>
<p>-DNMT inhibitor used for the treatment of MDS that progressed to AML (Acute Myelocytic Leukemia ). It stops DNA hypermethylation, for example at the CGI, or CGI shores.</p>
<p>- It is a nucleoside analogue,irreversibly binds DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA.</p>
<p>- It is replication-dependent, hence it's effects on rapidly replicating malignant blood cells. The drug may disrupt CGI and shores hypermethylation.</p>
<p>- Mechanism of action still unclear</p>
<p>-Final effec: HYPO/DEmethylation of DNA</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>-Epigenetic effects are mitotically transmitted in somatic cells from mother cells to daughter cells, thus they have enduring effects.</p>
<p>-The sensitive period is that period during which DNA is demethylated and then re-methylated again. This happens twice:</p>
<p>The first wave of genome-wide DNA demethylation takes place shortly after fertilization, with the maternal genome passively demethylated and the paternal  is actively demethylated. Imprinted DMRs are maintained despite this demethylation event. De novo methylation occurs around implantation.</p>
<p> A second wave of demethylation is initiated in the Primordial Germ Cells (PGC) stage. In the male germ cells, methylation imprints are acquired in prespermatogonia; in female germ cells, methylation in growing oocytes is maintained through out life.</p>
<p>-Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because it will prevent ALL methylation, including methylation necessary for normal function of cells DNA, histone function , and chromatin state. For example: normal DNA needs H3K4me (methylation of H3K4); absence of that methylation is hall mark of cancer. H4K20me in histone is found in normal cells; absence of this histone  methylation is characteristic finding in cancer cells. One of the functions of DNA methylation is to maitain genomic stability; absent this methylation-this stability will be lost.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>-In the normal cell, CGIs are not methylated whereas intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. This is so as  to provide chromosomal stability, assure a state of heterochromatinization, prevent illegitimate combinations, deletions , insertions.</p>
<p>- The reverse is true for cancer cells. CGIs are hypermethylated whereas inter-genic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. Thus, we have genomic instability with the chromosome in euchromatin state, with opportunities for re-alignment, mis-alignment, recombinations. Indeed, the repeats can make copies of themselves; jump around the genome; transpose, activate neighboring genes; activate promoters leading to transcriptional aberrations. The overall outcome isthat one has in cancer , deletions,insertions, reciprocal translocations, and gnomic instability. </p>
<p>- Hypermethylations of CGIs and shores in cancer are usually found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, thus suppressing the suppressors; methylation tends to progress with time as the cancer progresses. According to Knudson Hypothesis, multiple "hits" to DNA are required, and these methylation epimutation  hits are mitotically and selectively heritable to daudgter cells. Some cases of CGI hypermethylation, known as CIMP, are associated with distinct tumors, e.g. colorectal cancer, glioma, neuroblastoma.  In these CIMPs, islands of a set of genes (not a single gene) are frequently (hyper)methylated, and these islands differ by tumor type. CIMPS have favorable prognosis.</p>
<p>-The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regiond and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integration and silence cryptic transcription start sites/splice sites. Methylation of repeats prevents illegitimate recombinations and transpositions. In<strong> ALL </strong>cancers, the earliest epigenetic aberration found is de/hypo/methylation of these regions (often with concommittant CPI hypermethylation), leading to genomic instability-deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>In the normal cell</strong>:</p>
<p> -the<strong> maternal allele ICR is unmethylated </strong>and isulated by the CTCF protein; the<strong> H19 gene is unmethylated</strong>; the enhancer will act on H19;<strong> Igf2 will be silent</strong></p>
<p> -the<strong> paternal allele ICR is METHYLATED </strong>and NO CTCF4 protein insulation;<strong>H19 is methylated</strong>;the enhancer acts on <strong>Igf2 which is expressed from the paternal allele only</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>In Wilm's tumor</strong>:</p>
<p> -<strong>the maternal allele ICR is now also methylated</strong>;the<strong> H19 gene is also methylated</strong>, therefore no CTCF insulation;the enhancers can act on <strong>Igf2 which is expressed</strong></p>
<p> -the paternal allele: no change from normal cell</p>
<p>Therefore:we now have<strong> in Wilm's tumor double dose of Igf2</strong> as compared to normal cell.<strong> Igf2 is a growth promoting gene</strong>, resulting in Wilm's tumor. This is an example of how a DNA methylation,hyper or hypo, (in this case hyper), at ICR can result in loss of expression of growth-restricting genes and over-expression of growth-promoting genes.</p>
