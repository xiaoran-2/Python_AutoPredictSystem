    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is typically low, and is uncorrelated with active gene expression. However, in cancer, many CpG islands become hypermethylated, especially those regulating tumor supressor genes. This leads to downregulation of the genes whose promoters contain these CpG islands. This disruption of CpG methylation is particularly characteristic of the "methylator" phenotypes identified in colorectal and breast cancers, as well as gliomas, and is associated with metastasis and poorer clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements keeps these unused regions of the genome compact and inaccessible, preventing incorrect recombination events from taking place during the course of DNA repair. During cancer, most of the genome become hypomethylated. This makes these regions of the genome more susceptible to damage, and more accessible by DNA splicing enzymes, which can then perform dangerous recombinations of the chromosomes. These recombination events will sometimes move genes between active and inactive regions of the genome, or place tumor supressors far from their normally active promoters, and oncogenes near highly active promoters. All of these types of events lead to more aggresive cancers and poorer prognosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster contains an ICR that is unmethylated at the maternally imprinted allele. This allows the ICR to interact with the insulator protein CTCF, which prevents downstream enhancer elements from reaching the Igf2 locus, and downregulates expression of Igf2. At the paternally imprinted locus, the ICR is methylated, blocking interaction with CTCF. This allows the enhancer regions to reach the Igf2 locus, and boosts expression of Igf2. Igf2 is a key growth factor, and balance between the two imprints allows for normal growth to proceed. In Wilm's tumor, the paternal imprint is placed at both alleles. This leads to overexpression of Igf2, encouraging overgrowth of cells and increasing the rate of tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. By blocking the addition of methyl groups to DNA, this drug leads to a passive demethylation of DNA, which progresses over the course of cell divisions. This obviously progresses quite quickly in the rapidly dividing cells in a tumor. As discussed in the response to question 1, tumor suppressor genes are frequently hypermethylated in cancer, downregulating their activity. By blocking this hypermethylation, Decitabine allows tumor suppressor genes to return to higher levels of expression, which lets them resume their tumor suppressing activities and slow down the growth of the tumor, or even trigger death of the cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Once methylations are placed, maintenance methyltransferases will copy this epigenetic modification onto the daughter strands of DNA produced during each round of DNA replication. Similarly, once DNA methylation has been removed, no methylation will be placed in that location lacking some kind of external signal. So, once pathogenic methylations have been removed by drug treatments in cancer, this modification will typically persist even after treatment ends. A sensitive period is a time during cell or organismal development where patterns of expression are being established, sometimes based on normal environmental inputs. Small changes during sensitive periods can have lasting consequences for the organism. Sensitive periods in human development include the period of DNA remethylation during embryonic development and the remethylation that occurs in the production of primordial germ cells. If a patient is pregnant, I would avoid treating them with epigenetically altering drugs, since this could have serious consequences for the developing embryo.</p></div>
