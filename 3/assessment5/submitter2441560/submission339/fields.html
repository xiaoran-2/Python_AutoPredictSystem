    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation at CpG islands is associated with negative regulation of gene expression.  A large proportion of promoter regions in mammalian genomes have CpG islands, and these are methylated to silence the expression of the gene. Methylation of CpG islands also regulates other functions such as imprinting, X inactivation etc. In cancer, an abnormally high amount of CpG methylation is seen in promoter regions, quite often in the promoters for tumour suppressor genes. These genes often control cell survival (through apoptosis and cell cycle control) or DNA repair. Disruption to their expression can lead to uncontrolled growth and proliferation, potentially resulting in malignancy.</p>
<p>In contrast to CpG islands, methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is globally decreased in cancer. In normal cells high methylation is seen in these sites, preventing uncontrolled activity of retrotransposons and endogenous retroviruses as well as counteracting the potential for excess transcriptional “noise” and maintaining genomic stability (so preventing illegitimate recombination between chromosomes etc). In cancer, this methylation is lost, and so uncontrolled activity at these loci ensues. This results in genome instability, and uncontrolled activity at cryptic promoters and retrotransposons. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>Igf2</em> is an imprinted gene which is expressed from the paternal allele only (except in the brain where both alleles are expressed).  The paternal imprint control region (ICR) allele is methylated, which does not result in silencing as would be the case if this were a CpG island in a promoter region. Instead the maternal allele is methylated and silenced. In the maternal allele, when the ICR is unmethylated, it is bound by a transcription factor called CTCF. It insulates <em>Igf2</em> from some downstream enhancers and instead they act on a long non coding RNA called H19. When the ICR is methylated, CTCF cannot bind, and so the enhancers are free to act on <em>Igf2</em> promoting its expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, both alleles have hypermethylation at the ICR, resulting in CTCF not being able to bind, and so the enhancers from both chromosomes  act on <em>Igf2</em> resulting in its aberrant expression. The protein IGF-2 is growth promoting, as it is an insulin like growth factor, and so this can contribute to carcinogenesis by causing abnormal growth/proliferation and survival of cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA methylation inhibitor class of drugs, since its mode of action is to inhibit DNA methylatransferase. These drugs are nucleoside analogues which irreversibly bind to DNA methylatransferases when the analogues are incorporated into the DNA. This prevents the DNA methylatransferase from being active and so results in a loss of methylation. This potentially reverses the abnormal methylation seen in cancer cells at the CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes, allowing their reactivation, which in turn results in proliferation arrest and apopotosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation is passed down to daughter cells after each cell division and require active addition/removal for the epigenome to change. If this is artificially changed then it may be irreversible and last for the rest of the life of that organism and possibly into future generations. Sensitive periods are periods where global epigenetic resetting is occuring and so any environmental cues at this time can lead to major epigenetic changes. These two periods are during gametogenesis (making of sperm and egg) and during the pre-implantation stage of early embryonic development. Treating patients who are pregnant, or trying to have children would be inadvisable since the major methylation changes caused by the drug could have long term major consequences for the global gene expression of that person/organism. </p>
