    <h1>Submission 230 from Anon (session_user_id: c0f106df897485d3db6200f3694c2473b3e0f32e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that is used in the treatment of some blood cancers and premalignacies, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic or acute myeloid leukemias (CML and AML).  Hypermethylation of CpG islands, which are often associated with gene promoters, is common in these cancer types.  Hypermethylation of gene promoters is correlated with gene silencing, and it is believed that silencing of tumor supressor genes and genes that promote cell differentiation has a causative role in these cancers.  At low doses, decitabine inhibits DNA methylation by being incorporated into newly synthesized DNA and blocking the activity of both de novo (DMNT3A and DMNT3B) and maintenance (DMNT1) DNA methyltransferases.  The resulting decrease in DNA methylation allows reexpression of silenced genes, including tumor suppressor and cell differentiation genes, which are thought to produce an anti-tumorigenic effect by slowing growth and promoting differentiation of the cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations to DNA methylation through epigenetic therapy can promote the expression of genes (by alleviating DNA methylation-dependent silencing) that render the cancer more susceptible to chemotherapy agents.  These alterations to the DNA methylation can be passed on to daughter cells increasing their treatment responsiveness as well.  During certain phases of development such as early embryogenesis (blastocyst stage) and germ cell development, methylation patterns on the genome are reset; these periods are known as sensitive periods.  Treatment of patients during sensitive periods (such as a pregnant mother) with drugs that alter epigenetic marks is inadvisable because it could change the epigenetic programming that is a part of normal tissue and cellular differentiation as well as alter the appropriate parental imprinting in the germ cells of the unborn fetus.  Alterations to parental imprinting have been associated with disease and birth defects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can result in abnormal expression of genes that can contribute to cancer.  An example is imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster, which is disrupted in Wilm's tumor.  An imprint control region (ICR) in this cluster includes an insulator and the promoter of H19.  In a normal cell, there is DNA methylation of the ICR on the paternal allele, which results in silencing of H19, blockage of CTCF recruitment to the insulator and action of the enhancers on the Igf2 locus promoting Igf2 expression.  In the same normal cell, the insulator and H19 promoter are not methylated on maternal allele, with the result that the enhancers act on the H19 locus and H19 is expressed, but Igf2 is not.  In Wilm's tumor, the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is hypermethylated resulting in a situation in which both alleles have the paternal imprinting signature.  In this situation, Igf2 is expressed from both alleles and results in increased expression of the Igf2 growth factor.  This overexpression of growth factor contributes to the abnormal growth of the Wilm's tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in mammals occurs almost always at CpG dinucleotides (the "p" stands for a single phosphate separating the two nucleotides).  CpG dinucleotides are often found in clusters called "CpG islands" and these CpG islands ae often found at gene promoters.  DNA methylation of CpG islands is correlated with gene silencing.  In normal cells, CpG islands tend to be protected from DNA methylation, while CpGs found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are often methylated, keeping these regions silent, protected and stable.  </p>
<p>Hypermethylation of CpG islands and their surrounding region is a common feature in cancer. Tumor suppressors are among the genes that are often abnormally silenced; however, hypermethylation of other regions such as ICRs (Imprinting Control Region) can also contribute to oncogenicity through alterations to gene expression and imprinting.  CpG hypermethylation can be associated with a good or a poor prognosis depending on the cancer type, but usually increases with tumor progression.  In addition to CpG island hypermethylation, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is frequently seen in cancer. Hypomethylation of these regions is usually an early event in cancer progression and leads to increased chromosomal translocations, remobilization of transposable elements and expression of tumor promoting oncogenes; these events can all contribute to the mutations and genomic instability often seen in cancer.</p></div>
