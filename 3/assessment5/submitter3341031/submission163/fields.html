    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Describe the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.</strong></p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands include X chromosome inactivation, imprinting , suppression of transposon DNA sequences, transcriptional repression via inhibition of transcription factor binding or the recruitment of methyl-binding proteins and their associated chromatin remodeling factors and proper embryonic development.</p>
<p> <strong>Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.</strong></p>
<p>In cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated.</p>
<p><strong>Explain how disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease.</strong></p>
<p>Hypermethylation represses transcription of the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes leading to gene silencing This mechanism involves direct interference with the binding of specific transcription factors to their recognition sites in their promoters.</p>
<p><strong>Describe the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</strong></p>
<p>In adult cells, human intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally highly methylated and this status is associated with maintenance of chromosome structure and genome integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Describe how DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer. </strong></p>
<p>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells is a common finding.</p>
<p><strong>Explain how disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease.</strong></p>
<p>Hypomethylation from loss of methylation at normally heavily methylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability (such as translocations) and oncogene activation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Describe  the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines     Igf2 expression status. </strong></p>
<p>Under normal physiologic conditions the <em>H19DMR </em>is methylated on the paternal allele that that leads to paternal specific expression of Igf2. Maternal allele is silenced.</p>
<p><strong>Describe   the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines     Igf2 expression status. </strong></p>
<p>Under normal physiologic conditions <em>Igf2</em> gene expression is silenced on the maternal allele, whereas <em>H19</em> is silenced on the paternal allele.</p>
<p><strong>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour. </strong></p>
<p>Normally, the maternal IGF2 is imprinted and is not expressed, whereas in Wilms' tumours the imprint is lost, leading to biallelic transcription of IGF2. Loss of heter-ozygosity (LOH) or uniparental disomy and loss of imprinting on maternal chromosome due to mutation are some of the reasons that can explain the H19/Igf2 cluster disruption.</p>
<p><strong> Explain  how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease.</strong></p>
<p>The Igf2 is a growth factor important particularly in placental and embryonic growth.  The Igf1-receptor mediates Igf2s proliferative and growth-inducing effects. Igf2 is overexpressed in Wilm’s tumour causing premature and unnecessary cell replication.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to. </strong></p>
<p>Decitabine belongs to the class of hypomethylating agent.</p>
<p><strong>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.</strong></p>
<p>Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p><strong>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect. </strong></p>
<p>Caner is known to have hypermethylated regions containing gene that suppress oncogenesis. Hypomethylating DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase increase in the expression of genes that suppress malignancy. These epigenetic changes are maintained in the target cells after drug removal and accumulate with each low dose treatment until there is a complete loss of cancer stem cell potential</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><strong>Describe how altering DNA     methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome.</strong></li>
</ul><p>As with Decitabine example, epigenetic changes that were made by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase are maintained in the target cells after drug removal since, because methylation states are heritable.</p>
<p> <strong>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.</strong></p>
<p>Sensitive period refers to a specific developmental or post neonatal window during which there is an increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms<em> </em></p>
<p><em> </em><strong>Identify sensitive periods of development.</strong></p>
<p>First 8 weeks of human development are considered sensitive period, prepubescent years for boys and early teen years for girls are also considered sensitive periods.</p>
<p><strong>Explain why treating patients  during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.</strong></p>
<p>There is an increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms during sensitive periods treating patients during sensitive periods can change epigenenome and since the changes are heritable any harmful consequence of the change will be maintained in the body.</p></div>
