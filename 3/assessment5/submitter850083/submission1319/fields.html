    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells methylation of CpG islands is associated with the formation of repressive chromatin structure via the binding of methylated CpG binding proteins MeCP which have a DNA binding domain and a transcriptilnal repressive domain and therefore DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with gene silencing as CpG islands are often found at gene promoters. Whilst CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation it is seen in phenomena such as X chromosome inactivation. In cancer hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes results is silencing and hence reduced expression. As tumour suppressors normally act to control cell death or restrict proliferation, reduced expression results in the aberrant cell growth and replication associated with cancer. CpG island hypermethylation is frequent in tumours and the locus specific nature of the hypermethylation results in the location of the methylation being specific to tumour type. Hypermethylation of CpG islands has been associated with MLH1 in colorectal cancer and BRA1 in breast cancer as well as others.</p>
<p>In contrast DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repeats is associated with the maintenance of genomic integrity and they are usually found methylated in normal cells. Genome wide methyaltion at intergenic regions and repeats maintains genomic stability by preventing deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. In cancer hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repeats is seen widely and leads to genomic instability due to the illegitimate recombinatyion of repeats, the activation of repeats leading to transposition into coding regions and the activation of cryptic promoters and the consequent disruption of neighbouring genes. Genome wide hypomethylation is sen to some extent in all tumour types tested to date and has been noted in ICF syndrome where mutations in DNMT3B result in the characteristic genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Loss of imprinting due to hypomethylation or hypermethylation can contribute to cancer due to disrupted parent of origin dependent inheritance resulting in the expression or silencing of both parental alleles. In the case of imprinting and Igf2 expression the paternal allele is normally methylated at the imprint control region which blocks CTCF from binding and in turn DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promotor silencing H19 and allowing access to Igf2 by enhancers resulting in its activation. In contrast on the maternal allele the ICR is normally not methylated and it consequently binds CTCF insulating Igf2 from the down stream enhancers which therefore do not act to activate Igf2 and instead activate and enhance expression of H19. In Wilm's tumour the ICR is methylated on both the maternal and the paternal allele and therefore the enhancers can access Igf2 in both cases resulting in its over expression. As in many cases with imprinted genes Igf2 is involved with growth and as its product is a growth promoting hormone hence its overexpression is associated with somatic overgrowth and predisposition to tumours. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) which due to its nucleoside analogues irreversibly binds to DNA methyltrasferase once it has been incorporated into DNA. By binding DNMT decitabine prevents the copying of methylation from parental strands of DNA to daughter strands during cell replication. As such the level of methylation at CpG islands within promoters of tumour suppressor genes is reduced resulting in an anti-neoplastic effect in the daughter cells of tumours. Due to the effect of decitabine being replication dependent cancer cells are more severly effected than normal cells due to the increased cell proliferation seen in tumours. DNMTi's may be more effective against haematological malignancies as they are depedent upon upon silencing of tumour supressor genes via hypermethylation of CpG islands within promoters. In concordance with this decitabine has been approved for treatment of myetplastic syndromes which are precursors of accute myelogeous leukaemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome because the state established by the action of the drug (for example the prevention of the trasfer of methylation to daughter cells in the case of DNMTi's) is mitotically heritable and is therefore locked in and then inherited by daughter cells produced by the tumour cells. A sensitive period is a time when the epigenetic reprogramming and clearing of epigentic marks occurs in order to restore totipotency between generations. These sensitive periods of development occur during primordial germ cell devlopment (removal of somatic marks and laying down of egg/ sperm specific marks) and during the pre-implntation development period between the formation of the zygote and blastocyst formation (removal of much of the DNA methylation of histone marks). Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable as the effects of the drugs may disrupt the reprogramming of the epigenome and the clearing of epigentic marks and result in the formation of an abnormal epigentic state within cells and particularly aberrant imprinting. This could consequently result in abnormal cell behaviour and could potentially be very detrimental to health.</p></div>
