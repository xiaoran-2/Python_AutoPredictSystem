    <h1>Submission 539 from Anon (session_user_id: 618e44ede4ea867672b3c6811b359d2ef727319f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat a type of leukemia named myelodysplastic syndrome.  DNA methylation is epigenetic mark usually found in several tumors and also is reversible making possible targeting these marks to treat the cancer. It’s a nucleoside analogue which binds irreversibly to the DNA-methyltransferase enzyme. Therefore the enzyme can’t function. As it is replication dependent it will affects more severely the cancer cells (higher frequencies of DNA replication). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG islands (loci with high density of CpG dinucleotides) are usually found in the promoter regions of genes and they tend to be protected from DNA methylation independent of their activity state. When is methylated results in silencing of the gene. Nevertheless in cancer cells the CpG islands of promoters tend to be hypermethylated which is a disruption very frequent in tumors. These changes in DNA methylation cause the silencing of tumor suppressor genes that controls cell growth, apoptosis or DNA repair. In the regions surrounding the islands (known as CpG island shores) aberrant DNA methylation is also found in cancer cells. These changes are mitotically heritable and alter with the type and progress of tumor.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements the DNA is usually methylated to maintain the genomic stability. In cancer is observed a genome-wide hypomethylation represented by the repetitive elements and intergenic regions. The hypomethylation in these areas results in genomic instability such as deletions, translocations and insertions. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The genomic imprinting is controlled by regions known as Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs). The imprinted genes are organized in clusters with its own ICR.</p>
<p>The mechanism for mediating imprinting depends of each cluster of genes. Two mechanisms have been described. One example is the H19/IGf2 cluster. The H19 gene is maternally expressed and Igf2 gene is paternally expressed. They share enhancers and their imprinting is driven by a CTCF-dependent insulator situaded between the genes. On the paternal allele, the CTCF protein can’t bind at the ICR due its methylation and adding the methylation at H19 promoter makes possible the enhancers to access Igf2. On the maternal allele, CTCF can bind to ICR. This interaction mediates enhancer blocking allowing downstream enhancers to access the H19 promoter.</p>
<p>In cancer, alterations in DNA methylation are observed in the ICRs causing loss of imprinting. Both parental alleles can be expressed or silencing. These alterations can result in loss of expression of growth suppressor genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes. As an example, in the Wilm’s tumour the ICR of H19/IGf2 cluster is hypermethylated causing the overexpression of Igf2 gene. The Igf2 is a oncogene which promotes cell proliferation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are two waves of epigenetic reprogramming (sensitive periods): during the period of pre-implantation development and the period of development of primordial germ cells. The treatment in these periods can influence this reprogramming and the genomic imprinting altering the pattern of expressed genes and the genomic stability. </p></div>
