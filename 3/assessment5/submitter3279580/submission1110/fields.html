    <div class="field-value"><p>An inactive X chromosome shows DNA methylation of CpG islands. This is an epigenetic dosage compensation mechanism in mammals, so that males and females have the same dose of genes on the X chromosomes. meCpG in a CpG island is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure and can be bound by methylated CpG binding proteins which can recruit other factors that condense the chromatin. meCpG can prohibit transcription factor binding, and alter gene expression. Epigenetically: the body can activate an oncogene by allowing it to be expressed due to the epigenetic signatures found at that oncogene, and you could inactivate tumour suppressor genes by epigenetically silencing that tumor suppressor. In cancer global level of DNA methylation decreases as it progresses from a normal tissue to a metastatic tissue. At the same time methylation at CpG-islands become denser. Two types of DNA methylation abnormalities can occur; (i) DNA hypermethylation which is locus specific and (ii) Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. Hypermethylation of Imprint Control Regions (ICR) leads to loss of imprinting. Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation) can result in loss of expression of growth<em> </em>restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>The function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions might be to maintain genomic integrity. The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is to maintain genomic stability, silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposition, silencing of repeats to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and methylation of repeats which may prevent illegitimate recombinations. In cancer: hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements occur. This leads to bring about genomic instability in cancer such as deletions, reciprocal translocations, and insertions. In human disease, mutation in DNMT3B results in ICF syndrome where genomic instability is a characteristic feature. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster of genes the maternal ICR is unmethylated while it is methylated on the paternal allele, thus paternally imprinted. A long coding RNA, H19, is produced from the maternal allele. When the ICR is unmethylated such as on the maternal allele an insulator protein called CTCF, which is able to insulate Igf 2 from the downstream enhancers, binds it. This causes the enhancers to be free to act on H19 and enhances H19’s expression on the maternal allele. On the paternal allele where the ICR is methylated, CTCF can no longer bind and there is no insulator action and the enhancers are free to bind to Igf2. Thus Igf2 is promoted. Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele and not from the maternal allele. Cancer cells show lost of imprinting. Lots of genes that are imprinted are involved in growth. Hyper or hypomethylation of ICRs can occur in cancer. With loss of imprinting you have hypermethyaltion of the ICR on the paternal and maternal allele. Now you have expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele as well. This leads to a double dose of Igf2 which is growth promoting and giving rise to Wilm’s tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent it belongs to the class DNA methyl transferase inhibitors. Decitabine is a nulceoside analogue that irreversibly binds DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs) after incorporation into the DNA in an irreversible manner. Sequestration of the DNMTs prevents methylation of DNA to be maintained and lead to hypomethylation. As a result genes that was previously silenced by DNA hypermethylation can be re-expressed. Re-expression of abnormally methylated genes leads to the anticancer effects of the drug (Nguyen et al., Lung Cancer: Targets and Therapy 2010;1:119-140). Cells need to divide for the drug to be active, therefore it work particularly well in cancer cells as they divide faster. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic reprogramming is the clearing of epigenetic marks, which happens in two phases: the primordial germ cell development and early development in the pre-implantation period. These periods are referred to as ‘sensitive periods’. It is periods during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms (Nagy and Turecki, 2012, Epigenomics 4(4):445-457). Epigenetic marks need to be cleared between generations to restore totipotency. This clearance of epigenetic marks is mitotically inheritable, thus, once the marks are cleared, when the cell divide to form two daughter cells, these cells will also be cleared and at every mitotic division from there onwards cells will have the 'cleared' phenotype. When treating patients during sensitive periods these drugs might interfere with the normal processes of epigenetic clearance, which might lead to disruption of normal epigenetic clearance.</p></div>
