    <div class="field-value"><p> Normal DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin.  Hypo or hypermethylation of DNA – can cause cancer by activating oncogenes or suppressing tumour suppress genes and causing genomic instability.   </p>
<p>Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. Methylation of a CpG island is a faithful marker of silencing of its associated gene. Methylated CpG islands are strongly and hereditably repressed . Therefore, DNA methylation has been considered as a mark for long-term inactivation</p>
<p>CpG islands  are found in about 60% of promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation,  independent of their activity state. However, in cancer cells promoter <strong>CpG islands</strong> tend to become <strong>hypermethylated,</strong> which then causes <strong>silencing</strong> of the underlying genes which may be tumour suppressor genes.</p>
<p>It is mitotically heritable. Epimutations are selected.  This leads to tumour formation. as wells as metastasis. CIMP or CpG island hypermethylations disrupt  a set of genes. <em><strong>CpG island shores</strong></em> are defined as regions within 2000 bp but not inside CpG island  Hyperrmethylation of CpG shores  also correlates with gene expression. Hypomethylation of CpG promoters  can cause oncogene activation. E.g R-RAS gastric cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions maintains genomic integrity, while at repetietive elements it prevents transposons  from affecting gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer cells there is DNA HYPOmethylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Genomic instability is caused by  illegitimate recombination between repeats in different chromosomes causing possible deletions, translocations as well as insertions; activation of  repeats and transposition. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Wilms' tumor is a type of embryonic kidney cancer that is associated with the <em>IGF2</em>/<em>H19</em> locus on chromosome 11. Igf2 and H19 exhibit imprinting. The two genes share enhancer elements and monoallelic expression of both genes is dependent on cis-acting sequences upstream of the H19 promoter.<em> H19</em> is a noncoding RNA  that can suppress growth. <em>IGF2</em> codes for a growth factor highly expressed in many types of tumors. </p>
<p> Several sites upstream of H19 are methylated on the paternal allele  and unmethylated on the maternal allele. In<strong> normal c</strong>ells, <strong>the paternal IGF2</strong> and <strong>maternal H19</strong> genes are <strong>expressed</strong>.The methylated regions upstream of H19 work as  transcriptional insulators and bind factors that prevent expression.</p>
<p> In Wilms' tumor cells with Loss Of Imprinting (LOI), the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, <strong>IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off</strong>, causing increased cell growth.</p>
<p>Loss ofimprinting of the <em>IGF2</em>  is associated with many other types of cancer, including lung, colon, and ovarian tumors. Cancers can also form in cases in which a tumor suppressor gene is imprinted, and the single expressed copy of the tumor suppressor is mutated or loses itsfunction</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to DNMTi. DNA Methyl Transeferase Inhibitors. It is a <span>cytidine azanucleoside analog. </span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>Decitabine </span><span>causes hypomethylation of DNA. </span><span> </span></span><span>By  demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. (<span>An increase in DNA methylation can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth.  When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer)</span></span></p>
<p><span>Decitabine is also an antimetabolite and causes cell toxicity by DNA damage. It is prescribed for blood cancers rather than solid tumors.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Inappropriate epigenetic activity plays a significant role in cancer development but, unlike DNA mutations, which are permanent,<strong> epigenetic changes can be reversed.</strong> Epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. </span></p>
<p><span>H<span>istone acetyltransferases (HATs)*, methyltransferases, and chromatin-remodeling enzymes, are essential for controlling and maintaining normal gene expression patterns in humans. Deregulation of these epigenetic regulators, results in aberrant gene expression  leading to cancer and other diseases.  <strong>Anticancer drugs targeting DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs)* have successfully demonstrated antitumor activity.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>.<span>Epigenetic therapies affect chromosome structure</span><span>, which could cause side effects over a long period. </span>Role of DNA methylation depends on tumour type and stage of disease - so timing  and dose of  epigentic drugs ( application needs to be carefully done - in order to increase chnace of survival and not cause fatal harm to patient.</p>
<p>Epigentic marks are laid down during germ cell development and during early embyo formation .These are sensitive periods of development.  Epigentic drugs that alter DNA methylation or histone acetylation can permanently change  the epigenome pattern  and therefore caution is needed  is treating  pregnant or young patients with such drugs.</p>
