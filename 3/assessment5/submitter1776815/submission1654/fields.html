    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is low in normal cells as CpG islands often colocalize with gene promoters that are generally protected from methylation. On contrary, CpG islands in cancer cells are generally hypermethylated, for example in the promotors of tumour suppressor genes resulting in their silencing. Cells with silenced tumor suppressor genes may exhibit some advantage, e.g. unregulated growth that may favour them in comparison to normal cells and promote the disease.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements and intergenic regions are generally methylated in normal cells to maintain genomic integrity (prevention of transposition, block of transcriptional interference, etc.). In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated that can lead to genomic instability resulting in recombinations, deletions, translocations, etc.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster can be found on chromosome 11 in humans. It comprises imprinted control region (ICR) that might be methylated on the paternal allele and then Igf2 gene is expressed due to interaction with enhancers. H19 expression is silenced in this case as the promotor of this gene is hypermethylated.  On the maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated allowing CTCF insulator protein to bind it. In this position, CTCF insulates Igf2 from enhancers and these may promote H19 expression. Under normal conditions, Igf2 is expressed only from paternal allele.</p>
<p>At Wilm’s tumour the maternal allele of Igf2 that is normally repressed might be aberantly activated due to loss of imprinting (detetions, mutations), uniparenatal disomy, etc. Two copies of the Igf2 gene might be then expressed leading to excessive growth promoting signalling. Similarly, two copies of Igf2 are expressed at Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, where silencing of tumor supressor Cdkn1c contributes to the manifestation of disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA- demethylating (or hypomethylating) agents that inhibit DNA methylation. Decitabine is a cytosine nukleoside analog that once incorporated into DNA inhibits further DNA methylation by direct blocking of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). These DNMTs cannot then maintain the level of methylation within treated cells that can lead to hypomethylation. In case of severely hypermethylated DNA that was reported in certain malignacies may such a hypomethylation lead to re-expression of previously aberrantly silenced genes (e.g. tumor suppressors, cell cycle regulators, apoptotic pathway activators, etc.). Once expressed, these genes may act in their standard non-pathological roles to maintain cell functions and the cell generally may overcome some of the cancer hallmarks at the same time.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation status of a cell is maintained also after cell division and is present in both daughter cells. Therefore, the cells of the tumor that are originally hypermethylated and become hypomethylated as a result of a treatment can maintain their hypomethylation pattern (until something else happens that cause hypermethylation them again). Even if when the tumour is growing, new cells still keep the hypomethylated pattern of their mother cells.</p>
<p>It might be inadviseable to treat patients with any epigenetic drug during the time of epigenetic reprogramming in embryo and gametes development. That’s the time when epigenetic patterns are removed and laid down in the embryo and germ cells/gametes and some disruption in this process may cause alterations in the development. Precisely, the pre-and early postimplantation periods are concerned and also the primordial germ cells development to gametes period. Both are considered to be sensitive periods. Epigenetic drugs treatment in these periods can cause inappropriate epigenetic make-up of cells as the epigenetic machinery will be affected by the drug.</p></div>
