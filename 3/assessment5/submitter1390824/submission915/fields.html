    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of a CpG dinucleotide is the addition of a 5-methyl group to the cytosine ring base, followed by guanine in the DNA (hence the name CpG dinucleotide, p being the phosphate bond between the two). CpG islands are places where a cluster of CpG dinucleotide is found, and usually at the promoters of a gene. The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is silencing of gene expression, thus DNA methylation is an inactive epigenetic mark. Normally in a genome, the majority of CpG islands are unmethylated; in the case of cancer, however, the CpG islands are found methylated frequently, the phenomenon of which is called CpG island hypermethylation, in turn leading to condensation of chromatin. And generally, CpG islands are found at promoters of tumor suppressor genes. When both copies of a tumor suppressor gene silenced epigenetically (being one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis), because of DNA methylation, tumorigenesis could occur. This reversible, locus-specific DNA hypermethylation is found in essentially all types of tumors studied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. The normal function of DNA methylation at these two areas is to maintain genomic integrity. For instance, when DNA methyltransferase-1 is absent at the intergenic regions in a cell, the cell display genomic instability. The silenced repetitive elements (by DNA methylation) can prevent illegitimate recombination of the chromosomes. In cancer, a genome-wide hypomethylation is usually found at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, i.e., they are unmethylated. This leads to illegitimate recombination of the repeats, which in turn results in reciprocal translocation between chromosomes, insertion or deletion of the gene, because the chromatin structure become more open. This genomic instability because of hypomethylation also contributes to most cancer types. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region on the paternal allele is methylated. Thus CTCF (an insulator protein) cannot bind the imprint control region, and the enhancers act on Igf2 freely, hence Igf2 is expressed. By contrast, the imprint control region on the maternal allele is unmethylated. The CTCF protein can bind to the imprint control region, thus insulating Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. The enhancers loop to enhance H19 expression, and Igf2 is not expressed normally on the maternal allele. This is called monoallelic parent-of-origin specific expression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, the above expression at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted and imprint of expression does not occur. The imprint control region on maternal allele, instead of being unmethylated, is hypermethylated, allowing the expression of Igf2. Hence, a double dose of Igf2 is expressed, both from the paternal and maternal allele. As Igf2 (an oncogene) is growth-promoting, its overexpression in turn leads to the growth of the childhood kidney tumour, the Wilm’s tumour. Moreover, the disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster, leading to overexpression of Igf2, together with the loss of Cdkn1c (a tumour suppressor in the Kcnq1 cluster), can result in what is called Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. DNA methyltransferase-1 is an enzyme which helps copy the DNA methylation from the parent strand to the daughter strand during DNA replication, facilitating mitotic heritability of DNA methylation. Decitabine is a nucleotide analog which binds to DNA methyltransferase-1 irreversibly, thus inhibiting the release of DNA methyltransferase-1 to copy DNA methylation to the daughter strand. In order to have an anti-tumour effect, dosage of Decitabine should not be very high, as it was prescribed in the past, when Decitabine became more than toxic to cancer patients.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome by its mitotic heritability. That means changes in gene expression (in this case DNA methylation) can be transmitted through cell division, maintaining cell identity.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is the period within which epigenetic reprogramming occurs to the genome. The sensitive periods of development in human are during early pre-implantation development and primordial germ cell development. Pre-implantation period is the time following the fertilization of sperm and egg (formation of zygote), but before the embryo implants and make a placenta; within this period, DNA methylation is being removed (and also probably histone mark) and the level of DNA methylation reach a global low at the blastocyst stage, just before implantation. After that there will be a resetting of the epigenetic mark, in our case, methylation of DNA. The same (DNA methylation clearance and resetting) occurs when during primordial germ cell development. The epigenetic reprogramming is essential in ensuring the totipotency of subsequent generation.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because this may lead to disruption in epigenetic machinery of those patients. This may in turn, like in the case of assisted reproductive technologies, or cloning, causes imprinting disorders like Angelman Syndrome or Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome, and even cancer or early embryonic lethality.</p></div>
