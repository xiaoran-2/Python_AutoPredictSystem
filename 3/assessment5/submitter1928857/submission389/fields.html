    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Increased DNA methylation (hypermethylation) in and around CpG islands (including the island shores) is usually associated with silencing of the gene associated with that island. Genome-wide hypermethylation is associated with tumorgenicity.</p>
<p>Normal DNA methylation at CpG islands helps regulate gene expression. But in many types of cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated, and the repetitive elements, introns, and intergenic regions are hypomethylated. This disruption of normal methylation patterns may lead to aberrant gene expression; for example, if a tumor suppressor gene is silenced, this can allow cancer to grow.</p>
<p>However, both hypermethylation and global hypomethylation can contribute to cancer formation. When hypomethylation occurs at repeats, this may cause genomic instability. Usually, repeats are highly methylated and tightly packed into heterochromatin. When they are not properly methylated, and the genome becomes unstable, then DNA deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations may occur, which can result in cancer and other diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When normal DNA methylation patterns are disrupted at Imprint Control Regions (ICRs), they can cause loss of imprinting. Loss of expression of growth restricting genes, along with increased expression of growth promoting genes, such as Igf2, can be found in pre-cancerous tissue, eventually resulting in tumors.</p>
<p>Looking at the H19/Igf2 cluster as an example, when the maternal allele is normal--that is, unmethylated at the ICR--then CTCF can bind, H19 is expressed, enhancers act normally, and Igf2 is silenced.</p>
<p>However, if the paternal allele is hypermethylated (preventing CTCF binding and H19 expression), downstream enhancers then act on Igf2 directly, increasing its expression.</p>
<p>This situation can also occur in reverse, where the paternal allele is unmethylated at the ICR, and it is the maternal allele that is hypermethylated, which increases Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In a case where both parental alleles are hypermethylated, then CTCF cannot bind to either one; H19 is blocked, and downstream growth enhancers act on Igf2. This greatly increases the expression of Igf2, which results in Wilm’s tumor. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug in a class called DNA-demethylating agents. It inhibits DNA methyltransferases, so that methyl groups cannot be attached to DNA. DNA methylation also alters chromatin structure, which also affects gene expression. </p>
<p>When somatic cells divide, the DNA double helix is split into two strands, and each one is copied to create a full double helix in the two daughter cells. Epigenetic marks are rapidly copied to the new daughter strands by<em> </em>DNA methyltransferases, creating perfect copies of the double helix from the parent cell. Tumor cells are very active and divide frequently.</p>
<p>Blocking DNA methyltransferase with decitabine prevents methylation of one of the daughter strands in each daughter cell; this prevents cancer cell reproduction, so that the cancer cannot grow or spread. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, are present throughout the genome. Since nearly all cells will divide at some point, altering DNA methylation could have wide-ranging effects. DNA methylation patterns are maintained through mitosis, so that when a cell divides, both of its daughter cells will have identical methylation. This means that, once established, DNA methylation is stable for the life of the organism.</p>
<p>There are two “sensitive periods” during development of an organism; during these periods, all epigenetic marks are erased and reset; The first sensitive period os during very early embryonic development up to the blastocyst phase; and the second one is during primordial germ cell development. </p>
<p>Treating patients to prevent DNA methylation during a sensitive period would be inadvisable, because many epigenetic marks are helpful and necessary. Preventing establishment or resetting of all epigenetic marks would be lethal to an embryo, and could have other detrimental effects, especially on germ cells in younger patients.</p>
