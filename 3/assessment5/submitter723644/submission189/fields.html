    <div class="field-value"><p>There are several abnormalities in epigenetic control in cancer, including changes in DNA methylation, histone modification and variants, architecture and noncoding RNA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When comparing normal functioning and in cancer, we observe that the DNA methylation at CpG islands is increased in the latter. This methylation is associated to silencing tumour supressors genes. These genes are usually involved in “fixing” defects in DNA (such as BRCA2). This hypothesis is based on the fact that methylation frequently occurs in tumour cells, being mitotically heritable. Thus, hypermethylation leads to an increase in the probability of the development of cancerous cells and spread. This issue has been described in colorectal cancer, gliomas,</p>
<p>neuroblastoma among others. Furthermore, the hypermethylated CpG islands are different depending on the tumour type, which makes difficult to define biomarkers. In addition, CpG islands shores have also an increased methylation in tumorous cells. Conversely, there is a also hypothylation of CpG poor promoters, which may result in oncogenes activation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Furthermore, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in DNA are hypomethylated in cancerous cells. This issue occurs in most tumour types tested and progresses according to the severity of the tumour (like CGI hypermethylation). The hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to an increased expression of genes that may lead to genomic “instability”. This instability could be due to bad recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition or even the activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. These deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions contribute to the development and spread of defected tumorous cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In summary, we observe a hypomethylation genome-wide and hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes in cancer, when compared to normal functioning.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, which hypomethylates the DNA. There are differentways that Decitabine can act as a anti-tumour effect. Shin et al. (2012) have demonstrated that Decitabine induces apoptosis leukemia cells thorugh intracellular reactive oxygen species generation (ROS). In Onda et al. (2012), the authors have shown that it  decreased the ABCB1 mRNA and P-gp expressions, which increased sensitivity to anticancer drugs. Kalac et al. (2011), suggested that there is an interactions between histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) and decitabine. Briefly, although there are several studies on decitabine as an anti-tumour drug, the mechanisms of action depends on the tumour type and the context.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome since it is mitotic heritable and there are mechanisms of state maintenance (e.g., silencing Dnmt1 and Smchd1). There are sensitive periods in the lifespan, when altered environments (such as the use of medications, e.g.: decitabine) may have an effect on epigenetic control. These sensitive periods where epigenetic reprogramming may occur are during the formation of gametes, fertilized egg and epiblast stages, and primordial germ cells. Treating patients during these sensitive periods is inadvisable because some of these alterations in epigenetic states may have transgenerational effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In typical (non tumour) cells, the maternal lgf2 is inactived and only the paternal Igf2 is expressed. This inactivation occurs by the methylation of CpG of Igf2. The activation of the silent maternal Igf2 allele has been associated with the delopment of Wilms' tumour. This activation leads to biallelic expression of Igf2 and was it was suggested to be a key event in the onset of the tumour (Reeve, 1996). In addition, gene disruption experiments have suggested that inactivation of the H19 gene may result in the biallelic lgf2 expression and disproportional overgrowth. Moreover, it has been found that the biallelic IGF2 is associated to epigenetic modifications of the H19 gene (Reeve, 1996). Thus, we may speculate that an epigenetic alterations of the H19 gene leads to to the relaxation of IGF2 imprinting. Finally, the upregulation of lgf2 may result in growth promoting (oncogene), leading to the development of tumours contributing to the disease.</p>
