    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is just a simple addition of a single methyl (CH3-) group to cytosine at position 5. In mammals, it can almost exclusively happen only on cytosines preceding guanine (CpG) in the DNA sequence. The majority of CpG sites in human DNA are methylated. CpG methylation is a silencing epigenetic mark and may have developed as a defense against expression of parasitic DNA elements. DNA methylation is established and maintained by specific <em>de novo</em> DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, 3a and 3b). Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as an important component of cancer development. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns - hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue have been associated with a large number of human malignancies. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic region functions in a way that it maintains genomic integrity such that Dnmt1 null cells display genomic instability and silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites whereas silencing of repeats or mutation of the repeats to prevent transposition, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and may prevent illegitimate recombination in case of maintenance by methylation of repetitive elements. DNA methylation is mutagenic, so must also be a benefit i.e. protects the genome from transposable elements. All of these properties of defense are lost during tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>By example,in  the<em>H19</em>/<em>Igf2</em> imprinted locus,maternally-expressed <em>H19</em>gene and paternally-expressed <em>Igf2</em>gene share enhancers and their reciprocal imprinting is governed by a CTCF-dependent insulator that is located between the genes. On the maternal allele, CTCF binds to 4 binding sites within the ICR,generating an insulator that prevents <em>Igf2</em> from accessing the shared enhancers that are located on the <em>H19</em> side of the insulator. thus, the insulator effectively acts as an enhancer-blocker. On the paternal chromosome, methylation at the ICR not only prevents CTCF from binding, allowing <em>Igf2</em> to engage the enhancers, but it is also required for methylation at the<em>H19</em> promoter and silencing of <em>H19</em>.</p>
<p> Wilms' tumor is a type of embryonic kidney cancer that is associated with the IGF2/H19 locus on chromosome11. H19 is a noncoding RNA of unknown function with properties that can suppress growth. IGF2, stimulates cell growth. Wilms' tumor cells show loss of imprinting of the maternal chromosome and a switch to the paternal pattern of methylation indicating that H19 is inactivated in tumor cells resulting in the over-expression of IGF2. Loss of imprinting at the H19/IGF2 locus results in uncontrolled cell growth that leads to tumor formation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that targets the epigenetic machinery and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It functions as a DNA-demethylating agent. Aberrant DNA methylation of genes controlling the cell cycle, proliferation, metastatis, drug resistance, apoptosis etc is a common hallmark of tumors. One of the most characteristic features is the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (stop the uncontrolled cell growth) by CpG- island hypermethylation of the CpG islands located in their promoter regions. These sites then serve as targets for DNA demethylating agents, as chemotherapeutic drugs which help in the activation of tumor-resistant genes.</p>
<p>When used in combination with a histone-deacetylase inhibitor the drug is known to have slowed tumour growth in lung cancer (notable fact is that solid tumours are harder to treat, because the drug has to penetrate them).</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span class="apple-converted-space"><span>A team lead by </span></span><span>Baylin has shown that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth by altering DNA methylation (hyper in case of tumor suppresor genes and hypo in onocogenes) leading to re-activation or prevent silencing.Certain participants in Dr Baylin's study who did not show much response to the trial itself went on to show an unexpectedly good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them next. The drugs so as to say altered the state of the tumor, maybe by demethylating action conversely leading to re-activation or suppression of silencing of tumor-suppressor genes or by meddling with hypomethylation of oncogenes. Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable i.e. passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. Hence,hypothetically epigenetic therapies can bring to effect changes which stop a malignancy from growing without having to kill all its cells involved.</span>Sensitive period refers to the time of modifications and any treatment or tinkering at that level would involve risks majorly.</p></div>
