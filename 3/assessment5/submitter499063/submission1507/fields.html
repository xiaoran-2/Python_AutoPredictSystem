    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG island in the DNA represents areas where are an high proportion of cytosine and guanine. These islands are near of promoters of genes. In coding region of a gene they are unmethylated if the gene is  expressed. When the CpG island is methylated produce the silent of the gen, some of these  are oncogenes.  In cancer the DNA suffer a gain and/or  loss of methylation.</p>
<p>CpG island hypermethylation is often associated with the repression of the gene in which they are found. Thus hypermethylation occurs when tumor suppressor genes, specifically favors the tumor process.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions usually normally methylated, whereas in cancer cells is a decrease in methylation leading to genomic instability, activation of repetitions and transposition, recombination between repeats, enzyme action of DNMT…</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The maternally-expressed H19 gene and paternally-expressed Igf2 gene share enhancers and their reciprocal imprinting is governed by a CTCF-dependent insulator that is located between the genes.</p>
<p>CTCF binds to ICR generating an insulator that prevents Igf2 from accessing the shared enhancers that are located on the H19 side of the insulator. </p>
<p>On the paternal chromosome, methylation at the ICR not only prevents CTCF from binding, allowing Igf2 to engage the enhancers, but it is also required for methylation at the H19 promoter and silencing of H19.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour occurs in the maternal H19 gene promoter is methylated, causing the CTCF factor can not bind to the enhancer-blocker. This leads to non-maternal H19 gene expression and gene overexpression both maternal and paternal Igf2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA- demethylating agent, i<span>t hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase</span></p>
<p> It works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</p>
<p><span>Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites.  Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering the DNA methylation of both normal cells and cancerous cells ultimately lead to the disappearance of the first but as genomic instability effects, expression of genes normally they would not in normal cells etc..<br />A sensitive period would gametogenesis where if the epigenome is altered may cause effects on the developing fetus.<br />Patients who wish to be parents should not undergo this type of treatment, or undergo egg retrieval and sperm before initiation of treatment.</p></div>
