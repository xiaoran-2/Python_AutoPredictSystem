    <div class="field-value"><p>During mammalian development, a cell-specific DNA methylation patterns are established and maintained in adult cells. Methylation occurs at C5 of cytozine, almost exclusively at CpG dinucleotides. Both strands of DNA are methylated, so the methylation pattern can be maintained through cell division - new strand is methylated after cell division by DNMT1, a DNA methylase that recognizes hemi-methylated DNA.</p>
<p>CpGs are found in islands in promoters, but also in intragenic regions and repetitive sequences. Methylation of CpGs in promoters (and enhancers) is the mechanism of gene silencing. Maybe the most extreme example is the inactivation of one X chromosome in females - inactivated X shows methylation at CpG islands, which is associated with condensation of chromatin through interaction with other proteins.</p>
<p>In cancer, there is a locus specific DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Since these genes control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair, their silencing is the way cancer progresses. Different genes are silenced in different tumors: RB in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer, BRCA1 in breast cancer, MGMT in gliomas and colorectal tumors.</p>
<p>DNA methylation occurs also in intragenic regions and repetitive elements, like satellite repeats and retroviral insertions - SINE and LINE elements. Here, methylation maintains genomic stability by preventing activation of these elements and their transposition, and by silencing cryptic promoters and cryptic splicing sites. LTRs of SINE and LINE elements contain strong promoters, so methylation is the way of preventing transcriptional interference by silencing those elements. Methylation of repeats prevents illegitimate recombination, which might lead to insertions, deletions, duplications or translocations - generally to instable genome.</p>
<p>In cancer, there is hypomethylation of these regions - it is genome-wide, found in all tumor types, causing illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposones, and disruptions of neighbouring genes. Hypomethylation of intragenic regions (CpG-poor promoters) is less common, but can activate some oncogenes - R-RAS in gastric cancer, miRNA21 in glioma. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is monoallelic expression of a gene, based on parent-of-origin of the allele. Expression of imprinted genes is controlled by imprint control regions (ICRs). H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted - DNA methylation of ICR on paternal allele prevents the binding of CTCF, an insulator protein. Without its binding, methylation spreads to H19 promoter and stably silence its expression. Now, downstream enhancers can access Igf2 promoter, and activate its expression from paternal allele. On maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated, and CTCF binds to it, insulating IGF2 promoter from enhancers and thus blocking its expression. H19 promoter is also unmethylated, so H19 is expressed from maternal allele only.</p>
<p>In cancer, hypermethylation of ICRs is a common and early feature in pre-neoplastic tissues (although in some cancers there is hypomethylation of ICRs). Since majority of imprinted genes control growth, their disregulation results in neoplastic growth. In Wilms tumor, both maternal and paternal alleles are hypermethylated at ICRs, so Igf2 is expressed from both alleles, and H19 is silenced on both alleles. Igf2 promotes growth, and gives rise to Wilm's tumor. H19 is gene for long noncoding RNA, that serves as a reservoir for micro RNAs, which are involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, which are nucleoside analogues, that get incorporated into DNA during replication and irreversibly bind DNA methyltransferases, facilitating its rapid degradation. In that way it acts as DNA demethylating agent, preventing DNA methylation of the new strand of DNA after cell division. Used in much lower doses than when they were first discovered - in the '70s, when it showed only non-specific, toxic effects, decitabne shows good antineoplastic effect, and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Its mechanism of action is still unclear, but it appears that it acts both by epigenetic alterations (reactivating epigenetically silenced tumor supressor genes) and induction of apoptosis. Its effects depend on hypermethylation of CpGs, which presents a poor prognostic indicator in these types of cancer.</p>
<p>Also, it has been shown that decitabine in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors acts very effectively on some types of solid tumors. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic control is essential for all cell types, and altering of DNA methylation, one of the mechanisms of epigenetic control, can have long-lasting effects on epigenome. Epigenetic marks are mitotically stable - they are passed on to daughter cells during cell division, and that is how the epigenetic status is maintained in adult cells. Once removed, DNA methylation marks will not be passed to daughter cells, and epigenetic state will be altered for all future generation cells. When thinking about epigenetic anti-cancer therapy, this is not the big issue in adult patients, especially older ones, past their reproductive years. But for younger patients, there is a big issue with epigenetic therapy -  the effects of it may be passed onto the next generation, because they still produce germ cells. There are two periods in human development when epigenetic marks are erased and re-established (in a cell type-specific manner): early fetal development and primordial germ cell development. These are sensitive periods, since epigenetic reprogramming is essential for cell diferentiation during early development. In primordial germ cells development, epigenetic marks are reset for future generation, and imprinted genes are also reprogrammed in this period. So, any alterations in DNA methylation, for instance, during these periods can have detrimental effects for future generations.</p></div>
