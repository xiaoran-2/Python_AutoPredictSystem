    <h1>Submission 616 from Anon (session_user_id: 17e2f767fad285331f760ec5909e750c19675af8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p>impact of using the drug is that DNA methylation decreases. </p>
<p>When Decitabine is used DNA methylation is decreased, which can prevent tumour suppressor genes being silenced inappropriately. This then allows the body's natural defense mechanisms against cancer work. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands turns genes off in mammals.</p>
<p>In cancer, methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in that methyl groups are removed from the CpG islands. There is hypomethylation of these sites, which means that they are not methylated as much as they should be in healthy cells.  Alternatively, promoters of genes can be hypermethylated at the CpG sites, which means that genes which should be expressed are not expressed. </p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation contributes to disease in two ways. When tumour supressor genes' promoters (e.g. RB, BRCA1 genes) are hypermethylated, their expression is silenced, which can lead to uncontrolled growth. This is an alternative method to genetic mutations that lead to cancer. Alternatively, when oncogenes' promoter regions are hypomethylated, they lead to higher expression of growth-promoting proteins, which leads to cancer.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to silence the genes which are located there. </p>
<p>In cancer, DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is hypomethylated, which means that there are not as many methyl groups found as in normal cells. </p>
<p>This means that genes which should normally be silenced, such as oncogenes, will be expressed and can lead to disease. There can be for example a double dosage of growth promoting genes, which will lead to uncotrolled growth. </p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele of Igf2 imprint contol region is methylated and the maternal allele is unmethylated. At the paternal chromosome,  Ig2 gene is expressed because enhancers are able to act on this gene and lead to its expression. On the maternal chromosome, Igf2 is not expressed because the imprint control region is unmethylated and leads to H19 expression. Enhancers are not able to act on the Igf2 gene in this scenario. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour the maternal imprint control region is also methylated, as it is on the paternal chromosome. this leads to Igf2 being expressed from the maternal allele as well as the paternal allele. There is a double dose of Igf2 gene being expressed.</p>
<p>Igf2 is a growth promoting factor and its double dose expression leads to increased growth and a childhood kidney cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> DNA methylation has effects on gene expression, therefore by removing or adding methyl groups to DNA we are able to affect gene expression. This is mitotically heritable so all daughter cells will have the altered methylation state after the drug is introduced.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period during development when epigenetic marks are established.</p>
<p>Two such periods are: pre-implantation early development stage and germ cell development. </p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would alter their natural epigenetic programme, which could result in abnormal methylation patterns. Genes that were not meant to be methylated might end up methylated and vice versa. This can easily result in disease.</p></div>
