    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually located at promoters in different genes. Methylation of the CpG islands results in the silencing of the gene it promotes and in normal cells they are usually unmethylated. What happens with cancer cells is that CpG islands in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated and this results in the silencing of their expression. Therefore, the cells will become become less likley to die and more likley to prolifarate in an unregulated manner and could then turn into a cancer tumour.</p>
<p>The intergenic regions and repeats are usually methylated en in normal cells. This helps to mantain genomic stability because it silence repetitive elements to avoid transposition with other genes, transcriptional interference and illegitimate recombination. Methylation to the intergenic regions results in the formation of heterochromatin and therefore silencing of a region of the DNA. In cancer cells these zones tend to be hipomethylated and this leads to formation of euchromatine in the intergenic regions and the activation of the repetitive elements. This disruption generates genetic instability by the repeats making copies of itself and jumping around the genome where they can affect by transposing in the middle of a gene or producing disrruptive behaviour on neighbouring genes. The repetitive elements in conjuction with the euchromatine state caused by the unmethylated intergenic regions can also produce illegitimate recombination producing reciprocal translocation, deletions or insertions. Genomic instability can end up in producing cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the <span>H19/Igf2 cluster there is an imprint control region (ICR). In the paternal allele this ICR is methylated, this results in the methylation of the H19 promotor and therefore in the silencing of it. Since the cl.uster has an enhacer-blocking mechanism, the methylation of the ICR also prevents the CTCF protein to attach and therefore the lgf2 gene gets to be expressed. On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated, so the CTCF insulator protein attaches to the ICR and silences the expression of the lgf2 gene and in the other hand it activates and enhaces the H19 gene.</span></p>
<p><span>In Wilm's tumour there is a hypermethylation of the ICR, thus both alleles will behave like the paternal allele resulting in the silencing of H19, and the overexpression of lgf2. Since the H19 is a tumour supressor gene and the lgf2 is an oncogene the disruption of the <span>H19/Igf2 cluster results in the generation of cancer tumours</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, this means that the drug will start to take out the methyl groups all along the DNA. Since in a cancer cell CpG islands are hypermethylated therefore silencing tumour suppresor genes, decitabine would help activate these kind of genes and have an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically hereditable, this means that the daughters of a cell will have the same marks as the mother cell. If some drug modifies the methylation then the effect would be prolonged due to the hereditability. Now since the germ cells also carry epigenetic marks, if at their devolpment an alteration ocurrs in the epigenetic marks, then it would be affect the entire life of the organism, and the life of their descendants. </p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Sensitive periods are those stages in development when DNA methylation decreases globally in the genome.There are two sensitive periods, one is in early devolpment from fecundation when methylation begins decreasing until the formation of the blastocist when methylation gets back to normal. The second stage is in germ cells devolpment. </span></p>
<p>Using epigenetic drugs during the sensitive periods can altered the epigentic marks (modifyng the expression and silencing of genes) and since these marks are mitotically hereditable, then the cells of the patients will start to present odd behaviour and could even lead to death. </p></div>
