    <h1>Submission 2019 from Anon (session_user_id: 7e0b07f42beb5722f5278da67b6e5179c1c42efa)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decreasing DNA methylation as a result of epigenetic drugs can then reactivate tumor suppressing drugs that will be passed on to offspring cells. Sensitive periods are times when epigenetic reprogramming is occurring. See chart extracted from notes to view developmental time periods that are sensitive. Due to the lack of specificity of these epigenetic drugs, unintentional damage done during sensitive periods can cause long term damage especially pregnant women. <br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-261e05624dd7dfb1fa6c3ff7/970238/asst-5/970238-5212f219831567.81523632.pdf">question 4.pdf</a></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor that targets epigenetic machinery. It is in the class, DNMTi. As the dosage increases the anti-neoplastic effect decreases after a threshold is met.  Based on the following quote (“two other sorts of epigenetic drugs are already on the market. DNA-demethylating agents.... and decitabine... are used to treat ... the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.”) it can be stated that DNA methylation decreases as a result). Other drugs that attack errors  have silenced myc-activated genes have slowed proliferation.  Proteins like EZHZ have been inhibited thus reactivating tumor suppressor genes when H3K27 was the target of methylation. This last example is most applicable to this drug.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The fathers % methylation at IGF2 was inversely related to BMI.  “Demonstrates incomplete methylation” Obese fathers had a negative correlation with methylation on IGF2.The mother % methylation at IGF2 was almost independent of  BMI. Obese mothers had a positive correlation with methylation on IGF2. Together having both obese parents resulted in a net decrease in methylation on IGF2. IGF@ is overexpressed in Wilms tumor. “For the IGF2 gene, however, the copy that is inherited from a person's father is the only active copy in most parts of the body” (http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IGF2) “Loss of imprinting of the IGF2 gene has been identified in several types of cancer known as embryonal tumors. These tumors include a rare form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor”  How this happens can be found at http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/model-of-loss-of-imprinting-of-igf2-38079- Check Out the cited article here<br />"Loss of <span class="glossaryTermLink">imprinting</span> (i.e., the loss of normal allele-specific <span class="ontologyTermLink">gene</span> expression) can also result in <span class="ontologyTermLink">cancer</span> when an imprinted, normally silent <span class="ontologyTermLink">allele</span> that provides cells with a growth advantage is activated, resulting in uncontrolled <span class="ontologyTermLink">cell</span> growth and division."</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually unmethylated in normal cells. DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer because it is methylated thus silencing tumor suppressor genes and mitotically heritable. :-(<br /><br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is methylated. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer because they are hypomethylated. It can cause genomic instability. Some examples are “Illegitimate recombination between repeats,Activation of repeats and transposition, Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes”<br /><br />Note: Slide 9 in Week 6 was very helpful along with the other slides</p></div>
