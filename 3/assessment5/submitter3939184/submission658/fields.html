    <div class="field-value"><p>- CpG islands are regions with highly dense CpG sites in promoters. Hypermethylation of cytosines in these regions is associated with the silencing of the underlying gene. Methylated CpG sites are bound with MeCP proteins which have transcriptional repression domain and also can recruit other proteins which finally lead to the condensation of the chromatin region. Moreover, methylated CpG prohibits the transcription factors from binding to the promoter, so that transcription will not occur.</p>
<p>- CpG islands are not usually methylated. However, in cancerous cells they tend to be hypermethylated which will silence the underlying genes (usually a tumor suppressor gene).</p>
<p>- Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG sites results in the overexpression of genes that normally should not be expressed or the silencing of the genes that should be expressed in the cell. For instance, cells with abnormal hypermethylation of tummor suppressor genes might not be able to stop excessive proliferation, leading to cancer.</p>
<p>- The main role of methylation in intergenic region is to maintain genomic stability. They silence cryptic promotors which may be located in the opposite direction of another gene's promotor causing transcription interference; They silence the repeat elements (especially transposposones) and inhibit their transposition. They also facilitate the mutation of Cytosine to Thymine, which is again helpful in blocking transposones. Besides, they prevent the illigimate recombination between similar repeats throughout the genome. Gene body methylation is also thought to repress the transcriptional noise from abberant start sites, antisense transcription, and direct RNA splicing.</p>
<p>- DNA methylation levels in intergentic region and repititive elements is decreased in cancer.</p>
<p>- Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic region leads to increased illegimate recombinations between repeats, activation of cryptic promoters which have abberant outcomes for the surrounding genes, higher rates of chrmomosomal insersions and deletions, and translocations (genomic instability) which could cause diseases like cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Parental imprinting is usually disrupted in cancer, which might be because many imprented genes are involved in growth regulation. Both hypermethylation and hypomethylation of imprint control region (ICR) could occur in cancer.</p>
<p>- Normal CTCF binding region in igf2 ICR is methylated on paternal allele, but unmethylated on maternal allele. Thus, in maternal allele it<span style="font-size:14px;"> allows the binding of CTCF and the effect of enhancement on H19 leading to its expression while IGf2 remains silent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">- In the paternal allele the CTCF binding region is methylated and CTCF can not bind to it. Therefore, enhancers bind to IGF2 and it is expressed this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">- In Wilms Tumor the ICR in both maternal and paternal region is hypermethylated, while it should normally be methylated only in paternal allele.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">- Because of the methylation of ICR in wilms tumor both maternal and paternal alleles of IGF2 will be expressed and we will have abnormal over expression of IGF2 which is a growth factor, and its overexpression could lead to cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine or Dacogen is a DNA demethylation agent which is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome.</p>
<p>This drug is a Nucleoside analogue which binds irreversibly to DNA methyl transferases after their incorporation into daughter DNA strands during DNA replication, and does not allow the daughter strand to receive those methyl groups. This is devision dependent as only happens when the DNA is replicating. As the cell division continues, in the presence of the drug, the methylation level of DNA is diluted. Therefore, their effect is much more severe on cells with higher proliferation rates, including cancer cells, while normal cells with a normal or low division rate remain almost untouched. Lack of DNA methylation in cancerous cells finally leads to their death. Moreover, it is most effective on tumors which are dependant on CpG island hypermethylation such as myelodysplastic syndrome.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigentic drugs do not function specificly and they tend to have effect on all body cells. Since epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, any change that is made to them will be passed on to the daughter cells and if the patient is at a young age, he/she might carry these changes up to an old age. This effect is more important in sensitive periods of the development when the epigenetic marks are being modified. These periods include pre-implantation period (early development) - when epigenetic marks including DNA methylation of paternal and maternal DNA (Sperm &amp; oocyte) are removed and re-established - and premordial germ cell development, which is again followed by the removal of the marks and re-establishment of them in a specific pattern for the sperm and the oocyte. Treating patients in these periods will interfere with these normal sets of reprogramming of epigenetic marks and could have lethal or abberant outcomes for the patient or his/her children.</p></div>
