    <div class="field-value"><p>Access to information collected in the DNA is restricted by the 3D arrangement of chromosomes; tightly packed chromatin (heterochromatin) keep genes from transcribing while opening this structure (euchromatin) allows access to such information. Several chemical changes to the chromatin (epigenetic changes) are responsible for this phenomenon. In particular, adding a methyl group to Cytosine bound-to-Guanidine groups (CpG islands) is one of them. Direct DNA methylation is quite frequent in mammalian cells and impedes gene transcription. Usually promoter regions have a high density of CpG islands but do not show methylation independently of their activity state. However, investigators have found these areas to be hypermethylated in tumor cells thus becoming silenced. This altered pattern leads to genomic instability and silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Some examples include RB in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer, BRCA1 in breast cancer or MGMT in gliomas and colorectal tumors.</p>
<p>In non-tumor cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements (RE) are usually methylated. In the case of the former it is thought to be a mechanism to maintain genomic integrity, while in the case of the latter silencing prevents transposition, avoids transcriptional interference from strong promoters and may prevent illegitimate recombinations. However these regions appear hypomethylated in cancer, contributing to genomic instability as shown by data obtained in animal models and human observational studies. Besides the mechanisms described above, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and RE can lead also to activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Imprinting is defined as a parent-of-origin epigenetic silencing resulting in monoallelic expression of genetic characteristics. Methylation at imprinting control regions (ICR) or differential methylated regions (DMR) is maintained irrespective of the transcriptional output. Aberrant imprinting patterns have been reported in different cancers, more specifically in embryonic neoplasm such as Wilms´ tumor which is characterized by overexpression of the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). The expression of IGF2 and H19 (a non-coding RNA gene) is regulated by a central DMR. In the maternal chromosome IGF2 is inactivated by the interaction of the zinc-finger protein CTCF and the chromatin insulator located between IGF2 and H19. In the paternal chromosome DNA methylation inhibits CTCF binding, thus inactivating the insulator and permitting expression of IGF2. H19 is also methylated only in the paternal allele. Loss of normal imprinting patterns allows overexpression of both maternal and paternal IGF2, a growth promoting gene. This abnormally increased growth stimulus leads to cancer development. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an analogue of cytidine deoxynucleoside that inhibits selectively DNA methyltransferases (DNMT). These are a series of enzymes in charge of adding methyl groups to the DNA thus silencing the expression of different genes. Increased enzymatic activity of DNMT is a property of almost all tumor cells. In the particular case of myelodysplasic syndromes (or MDS, a form of cancer in the blood), hypermethylation of CpG islands and levels of gene promoter methylation correlate with disease severity and survival. In this context it is likely that increased activity of DMNTs could lead to hypermethylation of genes related to cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis, adhesion and motility as shown in human studies. Decitabin- induced DNA hypomethylation has been shown to lead to cell differentiation and apoptosis, two cellular phenomena that fight cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA expression is regulated by epigenetic changes which fall roughly into 2 main categories, DNA methylation and Histone modifications. Both consist on chemical modifications to cytosine bases inserted in the DNA (the former) and proteins associated with the DNA (the latter). Patterns of cytosine methylation are copied and replicated during cell division via the action of DNA methyl-tranferases (in this case DNMT1). This enzyme, having predilection for hemi-methylated CpG nucleotides can induce methylation in a newly synthesized DNA strand based on the methylation pattern in the complementary strand. In multi cellular organisms there is also evidence of the heritability of specific histone modifications, although the exact mechanism is not completely understood. Heritability of the epigenetic marks ensures lasting effects of those drugs that act upon DNA-methylation as the changes induced will be passed on to future cell generations. During epigenetic reprogramming there is erasure of the epigenetic marks and establishment of new ones that will define the fate of the cells. Reprogramming occurs twice in life, following fertilization and during primordial germ cell formation. Altering the epigenetic landscape during these two (sensitive) periods may induce severe changes that will result in abnormal genetic expression which will be also inheritable.</span></p></div>
