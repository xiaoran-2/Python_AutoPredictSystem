    <div class="field-value"><p>Alternation of DNA methylation in cancer cells may involve methylation at CpG islands and in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>CpG islands generally have a high CpG density and are found in many promoter regions of genes.  These CpG island promoters have distinctive patterns of transcription initiation and chromatin configuration.  They are usually free of methylation and regulate proper expression of the underlying genes.</p>
<p> In cancer cells, the CpG islands become hypermethylated. </p>
<p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is an important regulator of gene transcription and hence its expression.  It has been shown that increased methylation at these CpG islands often leads to reduction in the transcription and hence the silencing of the genes.  When the underlying genes are the tumor suppressor genes, hypermethylation at the CpG islands can lead to silencing of the genes and causes cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is often found in intergenic regions and repetitive sequences (such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions).  They are important to maintain genomic integrity (for example, by silencing of repeats to prevent transposition or to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters).</p>
<p>In cancer, hypomethylation is found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. </p>
<p>Hypomethylation of these intergenic regions and repetitive elements can cause genomic instability (for example, enhancing illegitimate recombination, insertion or deletion in chromosomes, and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes).  All these events can lead to development of cancer and other diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process that affects a small number of genes and results in parent-of-origin-specific monoallelic expression.  Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and/or overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>The H19/Igr2 imprinting control region (ICR) is located upstream of H19 gene.  In normal cells, several sites at the ICR are methylated on the paternal allele, turning on the Igf2 gene, and turning off the H19 gene.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, these sites are unmethylated, turning on the H19 gene, and turning off the Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>Thus, in normal cells, the paternal Igf2 and maternal H19 genes are expressed. </p>
<p>In Milm’s tumor, the ICR at the maternal allele becomes methylated.   This disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster causes the maternal allele to behave as the paternal epigenotype, turning on the Igf2 gene and turning off the H19 gene. </p>
<p>This causes overexpression of Igf2 and results in increased cell growth, turning the cells cancerous.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine) is a member of a new class of drugs known as DNA-demethylating agents.  It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p>Methylation of DNA is a major mechanism that regulates gene expression in cells.  When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth.  When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. </p>
<p>Decitabine works by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA. </p>
<p>By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs altered the tumor cells in some lasting way.  Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because DNA methylation causes epigenetic changes that can be passed on during cell division for generations to generations until they are actively erased. Once erased, they may not return.  Therefore, the drug can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all the cells, but making them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is the developmental period during which the cells are most sensitive to epigenetic alternations. For example, DNA demethylation has been shown to occur in early development, in primordial germ cell development and at later specific stages of differentiation.</p>
<p>It is believed that developing fetus, neonate and early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms.</p>
<p>Since many of these epigenetic changes are maintained and can be passed on to future generations, extreme caution is needed in treating patients with these epigenetics drugs during sensitive periods, so that no deleterious effects will result.</p></div>
