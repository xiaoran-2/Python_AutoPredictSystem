    <h1>Submission 1445 from Anon (session_user_id: f960f3f252431a6a6e9e99e26335359fe01f235e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <strong>DNA methyltransferase inhibitor</strong>, which is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases, in other words, it decreases the level of methylation on DNA.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nuceloside analogue, that get incorporated into the DNA upon replication and bind DNA methyltranferases irreversibly, preventing their release of the enzyme. </p>
<p>This drug have anti-tumour effect by reverting the hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, which leads to tumor suppressor silencing. These kind of genes have a key role in human tumorigenesis, protecting cells from uncontrolled proliferation, that may lead to cancer. Therefore, it is importatn to revert hypermethylation-induced gene silencing of tumor suppressors, in order to restore proliferation control.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a biochemical process that involves the addition of a methyl group to the C5 position of the cytosine base and occurs almost exclusively at CpG dinucleotides. CpG islands are genomic regions with a high density of CpG dinucleotides that tend to be protected from methylation. However, when <strong>CpG islands</strong> are found methylated, then this methylation is associated with silencing of gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer cells CpG islands in the promoter region usually become <strong>hypermethylated</strong>, which then causes gene inactivation. One example is the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, which are genes that protect cells from uncontrolled proliferation.</p>
<p><strong>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong> are usually methylated in order to maintain genomic integrity. In cancer cells, intergenic regions, repetitive elements and also introns are likely to be <strong>hypomethylated</strong>, which is associated with an increased genomic instability. One consequence of this instability is illegitimate recombination between repeats.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A <strong>sensitive period</strong> is a period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals. <strong>Primordial germ cell</strong> <strong>development</strong> and <strong>early embryonic</strong> <strong>development</strong> are sensitive periods of development, where epigenetic reprogramming takes places.</p>
<p>We should avoid treating patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods, because disrupting these periods will affect how efficiently the epigenetic reprogramming occurs. Furthermore, these drugs can potentially affect any cell, including germ cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting refers to the monoallelic gene expression, which is the expression from just one of the two parental alleles. Imprint is associated with DNA methylation at the imprint control regions (ICRs).</p>
<p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is<strong> unmethylated on the maternal allele</strong>, so the ICR is bound by the protein CTCF, which is an insulator protein able to insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers. As a consequence, these enhancers are free to act in H19, and enhance H19 expressions in the maternal allele.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the ICR of this cluster is <strong>methylated on the paternal allele</strong>, so the protein CTCF can no longer bind it. Without CTCF, the enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and promote Igf2 expression from the paternal allele. Therefore, Igf2 will be only expressed from the parental allele. </p>
<p>Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilms tumour, where the maternal allele behaves as the paternal allele, resulting in biallelic expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>Several abnormalities can cause loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 region and contribute to disease, such as mutations of deletions in this regions or uniparental disomy (two copies of one parental chromosome).</p></div>
