    <div class="field-value"><p>Reference: Hassler MR, Egger G. (2012)</p>
<p>CpG islands could be found in 60% of promoter and are usually not methylated. Methylation of CpG islands will cause the silence of genes. In cancer cells, methylation of CpG islands is disrupted by genome-wide demethylation or regional hypermethylation. CpG islands around promoter of tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated which inhibit the function of tumor suppressor genes, while CpG islands of other genes are demethylated which cuases instability of genomes.</p>
<p>The normal functions of DNA methylation in intergenic regions, which often occurs at repetitive sequences are repression of transcriptional noise, inhibition of antisense transcription, inhibition of RNA splicing and related to timing of replication. Thus, DNA methylation in intergenic regions are related to regulation of gene expression and chromatin compartmentalization. In cancer cells, genome-wide demethylation happens. Therefore, the normal functions of DNA methylation in intergenic regions are disrupted and further lead to instability of genomes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is maintained by DNMT1 on the basis of hemi-methylated DNA. While non-methylated DNA cannot be methylated in somatic cells. Thus, if DNA is demethylated, methylation cannot be established again. In early development, from fertilized eggs to blastocyst, and in PGC development, reprogramming happens. In these periods, patients should not be treated with such drugs. Pregnant patients cannot be treated with such drugs, or the normal reprogramming of fetus will be disrupted. That means genes which should be methylated cannot be methylated, which include DNA methylation in intergenic regions, and instability of genome will happen, which further leads to tumor of fetus.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint control regions (ICR) is not methylated in maternal allele. As a result, CTCF, which is an insulator protein, can bind to ICR, which insulates Ifg2 from downstream enhancers. After that, H19 is activated by these enhancers.</p>
<p>In paternal allele, ICR is methylated and CTCF cannot bind. As a result, Igf2 was activated by downstream enhancers, while H19 is methylated.</p>
<p>Wilm’s tumour was caused when maternal allele behaves like paternal allele. That is, ICR is methylated in both maternal and paternal allele. And the expression of Igf2 is too high while the expression of H19 is too low. Many imprinted genes are related to growth. The overdose of Igf2, which is imprinted gene, leads to fetal and post-natal overgrowth, and Wilm’s tumour is one possible result.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Reference: 1. Cancer's epicentre; 2. Kantarjian, Hagop, et al. "Decitabine improves patient outcomes in myelodysplastic syndromes." <em>Cancer</em> 106.8 (2006): 1794-1803.</p>
<p>Decitabine, which belongs to cytosine nucleoside analog, is a kind of DNA-demethylating agents. As answered in Q1, methylation of DNA islands around promoter of suppressor genes can silence its expression. Thus, hypermethylation is related to cancer progession. If Decitabine binds to DNA, it will inhibit further DNA methylation. After that, silenced genes, especially suppressor genes, are re-expressed and fight againt tumour.</p></div>
