    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because CpG islands are symmetrical, DNA methylation is stable and is maintained. Also, because methylation of CpG islands almost always means silencing of gene expression, most CpG islands retain an unmethylated status.</p>
<p>Methylated CpG islands are a hallmark of cancer.  They can stop expression of tumor suppressor gene expression. Another hallmark of cancer is hypomethylation of inergenic regions and repetitive elements.  In normal cells, these regions are methylated, but in cancer they are not, and can lead to genome instability, which makes negative genomic events such as translocations, insertions and deletions easier to accomplish.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting of genes results in monoallelic expression by the parent of origin gene. In the example of the H19/lgf2 cluster, the insulator model of imprinting is used.  The H19 maternal allele and paternal Igf2 gene share enhancers.  A CTCF-dependent insulator is located between the genes. </p>
<p>On the paternal side, methylation at the ICR prevents CTCF from binding, and that enables Igf2 to access the enhancers.  On the maternal side, CTCF binds to sites within the ICR, which creates an insulator to prevent Igf2 from getting at the enhancers.</p>
<p><em>(Reference: Required reading - Genomic imprinting: recognition and marking of imprinted loci page 2)</em></p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, it is thought that the silent maternal Igf2 gene is expressed, and that this biallelic expression of lgf2, which is thought to be an oncogene is a key event in tumor formation.  This can happen if the imprinting fails to function properly.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, is a demetyhlation agent that inhibits DNA methyltransferease. It is incorporated into the DNA of rapidly dividing cells where it</p>
<p>Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites, which when incorporated into rapidly dividing cells produces apoptosis. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As stated in question #1, DNA methylation is a stable genomic mark, so once laid down, epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter cells and on and on until erased.  Then, they do not return.</p>
<p>A “sensitive period,” is when the environment can influence genetic makeup.  It includes the primordial germ cell development through egg and sperm period and the period around pre and post implantation.  During these times, active remodeling of the genome occurs and there is removal and laying down of epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>These periods are, therefore, most sensitive to environmental change.…periods of active remodeling of the genome…there is removal and laying down of epigenetic marks…these periods are most sensitive to changes in the environment. </p>
<p>Treatment during these periods changes the environment for cells, and risks introducing methylation errors.</p>
