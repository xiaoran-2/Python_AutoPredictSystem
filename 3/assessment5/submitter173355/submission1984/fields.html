    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found at promoters, and normally protected from methylation, which would interfere with the promoters and silence gene expression. Though overall hypomethylation is a classic hallmark of cancer, we also observe extensive hypermethylation at CpG islands, silencing tumor suppressors. Notable examples include RB in retinoblastoma and BRCA1 in breast cancer.</p>
<p>In contrast, intergenic regions are normally methylated for genomic stability -- methylation blocks recombination of repetitive elements, and silences tranposons. In cancer, we observe overall hypomethylation, causing chromosomal instability which drives tumorigenesis. This effect has been borne out in mouse models.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many imprinted genes are involved in growth and loss of imprinting (i.e. alteration of the methylation at imprint control regions) is a common feature in cancer. It can act both through overexpression of growth promoting genes and underexpression of growth suppressing genes.</p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster on human chromosome 11 is paternally imprinted -- that is, methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. The paternal allele expresses Igf2, and the maternal allele expresses H19. The imprint control region, when unmethylated, recruits an insulator protein that blocks enhancers of Igf2. When methylated, it silences H19 through heterochromatin spreading: so normally we get one of each. In Wilm's tumor, we see hypermethylation of the ICR, causing overexpression of Igf2, which is an oncogene and promotes growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, which is FDA approved and on the market, is used to treat <span>myelodysplastic syndromes. It acts by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, thus lowering the amount of methylation in the epigenome. While it is not clear why it works, we can speculate that it is undoing the inhibition of tumor suppressing genes that have been abnormally hypermethylated, while apparently not overly aggravating genomic instability or affecting normal epigenetic regulation.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG promoters is heritable across cell generations. As CpG is symmetric, both strands will have the same meCpG dinucleotide, and so daughter DNA will be hemimethylated. There are methyltransferases which find hemimethylated DNA and fully methylate them, thus propagating the mark.</p>
<p>While this is exciting in that it implies epigenetic drugs can have long term effects on treated tumor cells, it is troubling for the same reasons, as epigenetic regulation is systemic and critical to development. It seems prudent to avoid treatment during epigenetic sensitive periods, when epigenetic reprogramming is occuring and could be confused by these drugs which play with epigenetic regulation. There is systemic reprogramming during primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation embryo development, but individual organs have their own further periods of reprogramming. </p></div>
