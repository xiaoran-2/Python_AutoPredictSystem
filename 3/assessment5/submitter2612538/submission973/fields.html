<p>Disruption to DNA methylation in cancer can have one of two main types of effect, depending on the site of methylation. CpG islands, often at promoters, are usually not methylated. If methylated, this silences gene expression, mainly by allowing the binding of proteins that repress transcription or condense chromatin. In rare cases, the methylation prevents the binding of necessary transcription factors. In cancer, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, particularly in promoters of tumour suppressor genes, preventing their expression. CIMP cancers are ones where a set of genes’ CpG islands (different genes in different tumours) are hypermethylated, leading to clinically distinct tumours which have the potential for epigenetic therapy. There has also been found to be hypermethylation at CpG island shores, stretching 2kb either way around the CpG islands.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells. This helps prevent translocations, transpositions and transcriptional interference. In cancer there is a general hypomethylation of the genome. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements causes genomic instability due to allowing illegitimate recombination between repeats, the activating of cryptic promoters, and disrupting neighbouring genes. This has been found to be the case in, for example, mouse models, where hypomethylation in certain tissues due to deletion of Dnmt1 causes genetic instability leading to cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Wilm’s tumour provides a good example of the effect of the disruption of imprinting on oncogenesis. In the normal paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster the ICR is methylated, blocking binding of the CTCF insulator protein. This allows enhancers to act on Igf2, and also encourages methylation of the H19 promoter, silencing it, resulting in overall expression of Igf2. In the normal maternal allele, however, the ICR is unmethylated so CTCF can bind. This blocks access of the enhancers to Igf2, and its expression is therefore suppressed. In the absence of access to Igf2 the enhancers instead promote expression of H19. The overall result of all this is a balance in Igf2 and H19 expression.</p>
<p>However, when imprinting is disrupted by methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele the CTCF is unable to bind and block enhancer access to Igf2. This leads to overexpression of Igf2, which is a feature of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. As Igf2 is an oncogene and promotes growth this leads to a predisposition to embryonic and childhood tumours such as Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Decitabine is a member of the class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA-demethylating agents. It acts by incorporating itself into the DNA in place of cytosine. Due to having a 5’ nitrogen, rather than carbon, it cannot be methylated, and thus prevents the action of DNMT. On repeated mitosis, therefore, the methylation is gradually diluted out and the genes repressed by the cancerous changes (e.g the p15 gene in myelodysplastic syndromes) can be expressed again. However, these changes are reversible, and if the drug treatment is stopped hypermethylation and gene silencing recur.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have long-lasting effects, beyond the period of drug treatment, as the methylation, or its removal, persists through mitotic division. This has been shown in experimental mice models, and in human populations, where environmental changes during sensitive periods of development (i.e. when active reprogramming is occurring) have had permanent effects on both the subjects and their descendents. A good example is the effect on the agouti viable yellow allele in mice, of giving methyl donors such as B12, or alcohol, to a pregnant female. If the father carries the allele then methylation of the IAP promoter in the offspring makes them pseudoagouti, while the mother's coat colour is not affected.</p>
<p>Such sensitive periods occur during the pre-implantation phase (days 0.5-8.5 in mice), when imprinted X inactivation occurs, and at gastrulation, when random X inactivation occurs, as well as in the mid-gestation embryo when primordial germ cells are being formed. Treating patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation in these periods would be inadvisable as it could negatively affect imprinting and XCI, not only in the patient but in future generations.</p></div>
