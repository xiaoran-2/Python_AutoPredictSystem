    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer can be caused by genetic factors, primarily the mutation of genes and translocations, but also by epigenetic malfunctions. Main problems are aberrations in methylation related to tumour suppressor genes:</p>
<p>-  Methylation in loci which should not be methylated (Hypermethylation)</p>
<p>- Lack of methylation in loci which would require methylation (Hypomethylation)</p>
<p>In the gradual degradation of a normal cell via hyperplasia and neoplasia to a  invasive, metastatic cell the normal global methylation is being reduced constantly, whereas the methylation of some CpG islands grows.</p>
<p>In a normal cell the gene promoters CpG island and CpG island shores are not methylated, therefore the gene is active, whereas repetitive elements, intergenic region and inton are methylated, i.e. silenced.</p>
<p>In cancer cells the methylation distribution is just the opposite: Repetitive elements, intergenic region and inton are not methylated, i.e. active, whereas the gene promotors are methylated, i.e. silenced.</p>
<p>The silencing of tumour suppressor genes, which has been found in several cancers like retinablastoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer and gliomas, has the same effect as a genetic mutation to these genes: It destroys the equilibrium between growth promoting genes in the cell and growth restricting genes. The function of intergenic regions is still not fully known, repetitive elements, however, can cause serious diseases, also other than cancer. The DNA methylation aberrations which are mitotically heritable occur frequently in tumours, they are even more frequent than mutations, they vary by tumour type. However, there is one advantage to the patient: Other than with mutations, those epimutations are reversible, there is a chance to correct the aberration with the help of specialized drugs, the cancer cell need not be destroyed like in chemotherapy. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster the normal methylation pattern of the paternal allele is as follows: The ICR is methylated which avoids binding of the insulating factor CTCF and also silences H19, the enhancers can approach the growth promoter Igf2, which is expressed.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated, so CTCF can bind,  prohibiting the enhancers from approaching Igf2, which is, therefore, silent. The enhancers are redirected  to H19 which is expressed. In this combination the gene is paternally imprinted.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, which is a childhood kidney tumour, the H19/Igf2 cluster imprinting is disrupted, since the ICR in the maternal allele is also methylated, the maternal allele looks and functions exactly like the paternal allele.</p>
<p>The disruption causes an overexpression of  Igf2, the cell receives a double dosis of the growth promoter.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The FDA approved Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor in the form of azacitine.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylator, it binds DNMTs after they are incorporated in DNA, therefore it is replication dependent.</p>
<p>Decitabine is used against myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a percursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia. The mechanism is still unclear, but it reduces hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes. It has an anti-neoplasic effect when used in small dosis, it is toxic in higher dosis because it is not specific. DNMTis are primarily useful for haematol. malignancies, but may also be helpful for solid tumours when combined with histone deacetylase inhibitors and chemotherapy.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations to  DNA methylation have enduring effects on the epigenome because they are mitotically heritable, i.e. they are constantly passed on to newly formed cells during cell division. The problem with epigenetically effective drugs is the fact, that their impacts are not only felt at the loci where this is intended but at cell divisions in general.  So basically they are more suitable for older persons where cell division slows, than for children.  Especially sensitive periods are the periods when interfering in the normal epigenomic processes can be more dangerous than in other periods. Such phases are above all the periods of epigenetic reprogramming, the PGC development and the early development. Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because the treatment would heavily interfer with the process of clearing of DNA methylation and the following resetting of epigenetic marks.</p>
