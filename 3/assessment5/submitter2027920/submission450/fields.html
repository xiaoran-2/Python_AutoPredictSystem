    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands present in promoter regions of genes such as tumour suppressor genes are hypomethylated indicating transcription of these genes, whereas other regions such as introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements (all together called global DNA methylation; 5 mc) are higly methylated resulting in maintaining chromosomal stability. What happens in a cancer cell, possibly under the influence of cellular stress or mutations of proteins important in epigenetic regulation, is a swap of methylation pattern. What is seen in most types of cancer is that the CpG islands became methylated, resulting in decreased expression of the tumour suppressor genes, genes that are able to inhibit tumour growth. In contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements became hypomethylated in cancer cells. This may result in expression of non-coding RNAs such as piRNAs or lncRNAs, causing reciprocal translocations deletions and insertions, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of the adjacent genes thereby destabilizing the chromosome. In summary, cancer cells have frequently hypomethylated CpG islands at the promotorsof  tumour supressor genes and demethylation at regions such as introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements, both alterations will enhance tumourgenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The expression of the growth factor<em> Igf2</em> is controlled by an imprint control region (ICR), indicating in this case that the paternal allele is expressing <em>Igf2, </em>while the maternal allele is silent for it. <em>Igf2 </em>expression is induced by methylation of the imprint control region on which CTCF is unable to bind. Methylation of this region will spread towards he lncRNA H19, thereby clearing the road for the enhancers present upstream to induce expression of <em>Igf2.</em> In contrast, the maternal allele is unmethylated at the ICR and therefore CTCF can bind to it and prevents methylation to occur at the lncRNA H19. H19 is transcribed and the activated enhancers act on H19 instead of the <em>Igf2 </em>gene, which is silent. In the Wilm’s tumor, the ICR of the maternal allele is methylated, as a result H19 becomes also methylated through spreading and this allele will behave like the paternal allele and express also <em>Igf2.</em> This mean that the expression of <em>Igf2</em> is doubled resulting in accelerated growth of the cells, which may eventually lead to Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decatibine belongs to the group of DNA-demethylating agents (DNMTi). This means that is drug is able to remove methylgroups from the DNA, resulting in a hypomethylated state of the DNA and that genes that were silent become activated. This drug can be beneficial to treat types of cancer with the indication of presence of hypermethylated CpG islands on promoters on tumour suppressor genes. These tumour suppressor genes with hypermethylated CpG islands on their promoters are inactive, resulting in  exacerbated growth of the cells. Treating the patient with Decatibine, which mainly acts on fast dividing cells such as tumourcells, will result in a re-activation the tumour suppressor genes and  inhibition of the tumourgrowth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation are established  during early embryonic development; the period of development between the blastocyst and the epiblast. These marks are mitotically inheritable  e.g. are somatically maintained. However, during primordial germ cell (PGC) and germ cell (GC) development epigenetic marks are removed and re-established again (reset of marks). All together, these periods of early embryonic development and PGC development, where epigenetic marks are removed and established are called sensitive periods. Another sensitive period is during the slow growth period at the age between 9 – 12 years of age for boys and 8 – 10 years of age for girls, when germ cells are produced. If people are treated within these sensitive periods with drugs that alter DNA methylation, then the development of the embryo and/or its PGCs inside the womb of pregnant women will be severely or lethally affected. They same holds true for altering the methylation state of the GCs of the children in their slow growth period, their offspring will be severely affected. </p></div>
