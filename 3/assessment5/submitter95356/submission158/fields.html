    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration of DNA methylation is seen more frequently than genetic mutations as a cause of cancer. Contributions to cancer include methylating tumor-suppressing areas of the genome, demethylating tumor-promoting genes and destabilizing the genome.  </p>
<p>The CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor-supporessor genes and are normally hypomethylated, which allows these genes to be expressed.  In cancer, the CpG islands become hypermethylated, which suppresses expression of the tumor-suppressor genes, leading to in increased likelihood of tumors forming.</p>
<p>DNA hypermethylation can be used as a biomarket to identify tumor cells or specific features, such as metastasis. Panels of biomarkers can be used to identify tumor types. The type of methylation can affect prognosis in a particular tumor type. Since treatment is dependent on the type of tumor, analysis of DNA methylation can help identify the primary tumor when the cancer has metastasized.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally hypermethylated, which maintains genetic stability by suppressing repeats and silencing tumor-promoting genes. Cancer can be caused by these areas becoming hypomethylated, which increases repeats, deletions, and illegitimate recombination. This can cause genetic mutations which can lead to formation of tumors. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promotors can lead to expression of tumor-promoting genes which are normally silenced. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNMTI (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) class of drugs. It is a DNA demethylating agent.</p>
<p>Decitabine is incorporated into DNA and works while the cell is replicating. It binds DNA methyltransferase to prevent it from copying methylation to daughter strands. It has a greater effect on cancer cells because they divide more rapidly. The effect is unknown on non-cancer cells when they attempt to divide.</p>
<p>Low doses of the drug cause DNA demethylation, but it is not known whether there are any other ways in which it acts. It is most effective in mylodisplastic syndrome, probably because this disease is caused by CPG island hypermethylation, which silences tumor-suppressor genes. Demethylation would then allow these genes to be expressed, leading to less tumor growth. It is given to older patients who have already tried more conventional cancer drugs, and they generally respond well without many side effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is a method of controlling the dose of a gene, frequently in a gene that controls growth. Loss of imprinting can cause both alleles of a gene to be either expressed or silenced when normally one or the other is expressed.</p>
<p>The imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/lgf2 cluster is normally methylated on the paternal allele This allows the enhancers to act on igf2, so igf2 will be expressed</p>
<p>The corresponding ICR is normally unmethylated on the maternal allele. This causes CTCF to bind the insulator element, so the enhancers will act on H19 and igf2 will be silent</p>
<p>WIth hypermethylation, the ICR of both alleles are methylated, and igf2 is expressed on both alleles, giving a double dose. Since igf2 is growth-promoting, this can cause Wilm's tumor</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When a drug alters DNA methylation, it affects daughter cells that are a result of cell division. Since cancer cells replicate rapidly, this causes an enduring effect because the tumor cells will permanently be altered.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is when epigenetic reprogramming occurs, during germ cell development and early development. IVF and ICSI are performed during these periods and can disrupt epigenetic reprogramming. It is believed that this sometimes leads to increased risk of epigenetic diseases. .</p>
<p>Similarly, administering drugs that alter the epigenome during this time could also disrupt epigenetic reprogramming, resulting in reprogramming errors that may lead to disease.</p></div>
