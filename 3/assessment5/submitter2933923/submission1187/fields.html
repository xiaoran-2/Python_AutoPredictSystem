    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal tissue the global levels of DNA methylation at CpG islands are low, while the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hypermethylated. However, when a tissue progresses to a metastatic tissue, this level increases substantially in the CpG islands, becoming the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements hypomethylated. In cancer, on the other hand, the DNA hypermethylation of the CpG islands induces the silencing of tumour suppressor genes, making the control regulation of the cell inefficient. Thus, since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, this epimutation is rapidly selected, having the cancer cells more advantage in their division or simply die less, compared with the normal ones. Their abnormal rapid proliferation will lead to severe cancer diseases. Moreover, the hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements, in abnormal cells, also leads to genomic instability by promoting the recombination between chromosome regions without genetic identity - only possible because the unmethylated regions becomes euchromatin – and/or also through deletions and insertions. Less common than the described hypomethylation process is the CpG poor promoter hypomethylation that can activate the expression of oncogenes favoring diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinting control region (ICR) in a normal cell is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. Considering this normal situation, the unmethylated control region in the case of the maternal allele will allow the binding of CTCF to this region, the enhancers elements will promote the expression of the gene H19, but the Igf2 gene is inaccessible, so it is not expressed. In the paternal case, the ICR has not the CTCF bonded, so the Igf2 gene is accessible by the enhancers, being transcribed. However, once the imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted, the maternal allele becomes also hypermethylated leading to the expression of the Igf2 also in the maternal allele. It will results in overexpression of the Igf2 gene, compared with the one in a normal cell. As the Igf2 is an oncogene that promotes growth, this abnormal concentration is associated with the Wilm’s tumour disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents, binding to the DNA at specific control regions avoiding the fixation of methyl groups by the DNA-methyltransferase. Being hypomethylated, the DNA becomes less dense and so the genes in that region become expressed. As cancer cells have a high rate of division, the function of the mentioned hypomethylating agent is restore the normal division of the cells, having an anti-tumour effect by locking the proliferation of the abnormal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome once the methylation marks are mitotically heritable, being maintained in the new cells generated after division. During the development there is a sensitive period corresponding to the pre-implantation and post-impantation periods and also to the generation of the primordial germ cells in fetus. Along this critic period, exogenous factors are able to have an impact in the epigenetic control, reprogramming it, being the alterations suffered passed to the next generations. Once these changes passed to the new generation, the descendants can be carriers of some cancer epigenomic mark or even manifest a cancer disease. According to the aforementioned, the drug treatment should not be done during the sensitive period, in order to avoid the transference of this dangerous epigenetic marks to the descendants of this patient.</p></div>
