    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are regions of high CpG density enriched in promoter regions of genes throughout the genome that are usuallly kept unmethylated regardless of gene activity.  DNA methyaltion in CpG island regions is usually inversely correlated with gene expression.  In cancer, there is often locus specific CpG island hypermethylation associated with silencing of tumour suppressor genes and also hypermethylation in imprint control regions leading to loss of monoallelic parent-of-origin gene expression.  Hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores in cancer are also associated with the deposition of repressive histone marks and the spreading of heterochromatin often in large genomic regions.  This is thought to contribute to the transcriptional silencing of tumour supressor genes and genes involved in regulating normal cellular function.</p>
<p>CpG rich regions within repetitive elements and intergenic regions throughout the genome are usually found to be methylated in normal cells, and this is to prevent illegitimate recombination between repreats, prevent activation of repetitive elements and transposition events and also activation of cryptic promoters that may disrupt transcription of neighbouring genes.  In cancer, there is genome-wide hypomethylation of repetitive relgions, including intergenic and intronic regions, which leads to genomic instability and increased incidence of chromosomal deletions, insertions and translocations.  This global hypomethylation can also occur in CpG poor promoters that lead to the activation of tumour promoting genes i.e. R-Ras in colorectal cancer, or lead to increased expression of miRNAs (miR21) that contributes to the decreased expression of tumour suppressor genes such as PTEN.  </p>
<p>Changes in DNA methylation across the genome will have different effects in cancer depending on the main driver of tumorigenesis.  In other words, global hypomethylation can repress tumorigenesis, if the cancer is driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation.  On the other hand global hypomethylation can enhance tumorigenesis if the cancer is driven by chromosomal instability and activation of repetitive genomic elements.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome if they are somatically stable or 'metastable' for the lifetime of the organism.  This occurs in somatic cells in periods of somatic maintenance following epigenetic reprogramming that occurs during sensitive periods.  The sensitive periods are periods where the genome undergoes epigenetic reprogramming, meaning the majority of DNA methylation marks are removed either passively or by active mechanisms and then are reset by de novo and maintenance methyltransferases.  These sensitive periods occur during early embryonic development during the preimplantation period and during primordial germ cell development of gametes.  Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these periods would not be advisable as they would not have a lasting affect on the epigenome, as methylation and acetylation marks are largely removed and restored, and this may not have efficacy in modifying the eipgenetic state of  tumor cells.  Also drug treatement during these sensitive periods may also have adverse effects on embryonic development, which is sometimes observed in artificial reproductive technologies and may also lead to imprinting defects.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster share enhancers and their reciprocal imprinting is deregulated by a CTCF-dependent insulator (the imprint control region) that is located in between the genes.  The paternal imprint control region is methylated which prevents CTCF, and without CTCF binding, DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter region to silence H19 transcription of the H19 long non-coding RNA, and this allows enhancers to access the Igf2 promoter region to activate Igf2 transcription.  So Igf2 is paternally expressed.</p>
<p>The maternal imprint control region is unmethylated, and this allows CTCF insulator binding and this prevents access of the downstream enhancer elements in accessing the Igf2 promoter elements, meaning that the downstream enhancer then preferentially interact with the promoter elements of the H19 gene, leading to maternal specific transcription of H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster and the closely linked Kcnq1 cluster is disrupted by mutations and deletions leading to the loss of imprinting or by uniparental disomy, inheriting two copies of the paternal allele.  This loss of imprinting leads to disease due to the loss of tumour suppressor Cdkn1c that is maternally expressed and also by the upregulated expression of growth promoting Igf2 that is paternally expressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  It is a nucleoside analogue and irreversibly binds to DNMTs after they have been incorporatied into DNA, and therefore their function is dependent on cell replication.  Decitabine decreases DNA methylation.  </p>
<p>The mechanism of how decitabine works is till unclear, however it is likely that Decitabine can have anti-tumour effects in situations where the malignancy is driven by hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores in tumour suppressor genes leading to their silencing.  Inhibiting the action of DNMTs in this context, would decrease methylation in these CpG regions, and may also reverse the repressive heterochromatin state characterised by the loss of active histone marks (H3ac, H4ac, H3K4me) and increased repressive histone marks (K9me, K27me3) associated with hypermethylated CpG islands, leading to reexpression of tumor suppressor genes.</p></div>
