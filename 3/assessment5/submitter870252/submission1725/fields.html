    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation at CpG islands in normal cells is not widely spread (they are hypomethilated); the purpose of methylation at these islands is to silence gene expression. Cancer cells show a swap in the methylation of these islands (now hypermethylated), leading to silencing tumor suppressor genes so the cancer can spread. It's important to highlight that this hypermethylation is reversible, and its nature depends on the kind of tumor. It increases with time. CpG island shores are also hypermethylated in cancer cells.</p>
<p>On the other hand, repetitive elements and intergenic regions (that are methylated in normal cells; the main function of this methylation is to keep the integrity of the genome and prevent transpostion, illegitimate recombination and so forth) are hypomethylated in cancer cells. As they are not packaged densely, illegitimate recombination can occur. Another consequence would be the activation of the repeats, letting them to transpose and sometimes to activate near genes. To sum up, results of DNA methylation in these regions disrupted by cancer include: deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations (genomic instability), leading to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster under normal cell conditions, the paternal allele shows methylation in its IRC (Imprinting Control Region), whereas the maternal allele is unmethylated. In  this case, due to the unmethylated pattern, CTCF binds to the IRC, letting the enhancers act over H19. As a result, Igf2 is not expressed for the maternal allele. The opposite occurs in the paternal allele. As its ICR is methylated, CTCF is not bound to it, so the enhancers can lead to the expression of Igf2 for the paternal allele.</p>
<p>However, in Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele's ICR shows an hypermethylated pattern, while the paternal one maintains its degree of methylation. As a consequence, the dose of Igf2 is greater - in fact it is double - as  there is also protein expression for the maternal allele. So in this case we would be talking about a loss of imprinting, because the Igf2 expression is no longer inherited from just one parent, but for both. As Igf2 promotes cell growth, the imprinting disruption at this cluster (loss of imprinting) can be associated with cancer, specifically with Wilm's tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the group of the DNMTis (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors). It's a nucleoside analog, so it is bound to DNA during its replication and then joins DNMTs irreversibly, not allowing these enzymes to transfer methyl groups to DNA. As these inhibitors are only effective in cells that are in active division, they are also called division-dependent. That's why cancer cells, which replicate faster, suffer the most important modifications than the rest of normal cells. </p>
<p>At low doses(as opposed to larger doses), decitabine has a great anti-neoplastic (anti-tumor) effect, as it sometimes produces DNA demethylation and kills the cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some cancer drugs, such as the DNMTis, can cause a memory anti-tumor response. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming, when the removal and resetting of epigenetic marks take place. There are two crucial waves of epigenetic reprogramming: during preimplantantion development and during primordial germ cell development. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable (specially during primordial germ cell development), as the epigenetic modifications caused by these drugs can be inherited via the gametes to the offspring (transgenerational epigenetic inheritance). That would be the case of germline-dependent epigenetic modifications.</p></div>
