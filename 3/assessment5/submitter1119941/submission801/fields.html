    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are two types of problems in DNA methylation that can occur:</p>
<p>1. Locus specific DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands and CpG island shores and at ICRs.</p>
<p>2. Genome wide DNA hypomethilation of repetitive regions, CpG poor promoters and ICRs.</p>
<p>Methylation at CpG islands leads to silencing of gene expression. In normal cells, CpG island are rather protected from methylation (hypomethylated). If DNA methylation is disrupted in cancer, CpG islands and island shores are rather hypermethylated which can lead to silencing of tumour supressor genes. This can lead to loss of expression of growth restricting genes and therefore to tumourous growth.</p>
<p>On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in normal cells. In cancer cells intergenic regions and particularly repetitive elements are rather hypomethylated. Hypermethylation is necessary to maintain the genomic stability and therefore makes sure that in the genome chromosomes aren't gained, lost or illegitimately recombined. Consequently, hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to loosely packed euchromatin and therefore to genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If you're looking at the H19/Igf2 cluster, you can normally see two different methylation patterns on the paternal and the maternal allele. Those two methylation patterns are important to avoid an overexpression of Igf2, a growth promoter.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, which is imprinted, the ICR is methylated which blocks CTCF of acting as an insulator protein on the ICR between Ifg2 and downstream enhancers. The DNA methylation spreads from the ICR to the H19 promoter which silences H19 expression. Without CTCF working as an insulator on the ICR, lgf2 is then accessed by the enhancers and activated.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, it is the other way round: the ICR is unmethylated, CTCF can bind to the ICR, the H19 promoter is unmethylated and H19 is expressed. By binding of CTCF to the ICR Igf2 is insulated from the downstream enhancers, they can't access lgf2 and can't activate it.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, imprinting is disrupted. Not only the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated but the ICR on the maternal allele is hypermethylated. CTCF can't bind to the ICR and Igf2 is expressed from both the maternal and the paternal alleles. Igf2 as a growth promotor is expressed in a double dose and can lead to tumourous growth. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is drug that can target the epigenetic machinery in elderly patients, suffering from Myelodysplastic syndrome that has processed to AML, by acting as a DNAmethyltransferase inhibitor DNMTi. The drug is a nucleoside analog and gets built in the DNA during replication. When the DNMT comes to bind the Nucleoside, the drug irreversibly binds to the DNMT, so methylation can't take place. As this can only happen during cell replication, cancer cells that replicate much faster than healthy cells, will be more affected by the drugs than healthy cells.</p>
<p>DNMTi seem to be causing DNA-demethylation. Yet it's not clear whether there are other mechanisms of action of the drug but as Myelodysplastic syndrome is probably dependant on CPG-island hypermethylation, inhibiting of DNMT might be most effective in this form of cancer, i.e. if a form of cancer is caused by CPG-island hypermethylation, one form of an effective therapy can be to prevent methylation by blocking the DNMT.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have long lasting effects on the epigenome because epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, i.e. they are passed on to following cell generations during cell division.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming, the clearing and setting of epigenetic marks. Sensitive periods of development are during germ cell development and during early embryonic development.</p>
<p>If a person was treated during this phase of clearing of and setting of epigenetic marks, methylation could go wrong, i.e. genomic integrity and genomic stability of imprinted genes could be affected.</p>
<p>Furthermore, DNA methylation is also essential for the viability of a cell. For example, DNMT knockouts die around mid-gestation.</p>
