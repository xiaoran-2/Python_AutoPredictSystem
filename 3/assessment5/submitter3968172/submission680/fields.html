    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a type of epigenetic marks usually occuring in the regions rich in CpG dinucleotides (CpG islands). Methylation at CpG islands is normally related to gene silencing, although they tend to be non-methylated. In cancer <strong><em>locus-specific DNA hypermethylation</em></strong> is observed and this takes place at CpG islands located in the promoters of tumour-suppressor genes. Loss of these tumour suppressors is one of the factors that lead to tumourigenesis and it has been determined that in some cases DNA hypermethylation occurs more frequently than DNA mutation. It has also been shown that different types of tumours display different sets of methylated CpG islands and that the extent of CpG island methylation increases with the progression of cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements also exhibit inverted DNA methylation patterns in cancer. In normal cells these regions are silenced by DNA methylation, thereby preventing genome instability. In cancer cells these regions exhibit lower levels of DNA methylation, refered to as <em><strong>genome-wide DNA hypomethylation</strong></em>. This causes more likely illegitimate chromosome interactions, activation of transposable elements and disruption of genes. This all results in abnormalities in the karyotype which can lead to tumourigenesis. In contrast to CpG island methylation, overall DNA methylation tends to get reduced as the cancer progresses.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 gene cluster is an example of parent-of-origin specific gene expression<strong></strong> (<strong></strong><em><strong>gene imprinting</strong></em>). In normal cells maternal allele exhibits unmethylated imprint control region (ICR), which is bound by CTCF protein whose function is to insulate Igf2 from enhancers, making it silenced. Enhancers are then free to stimulate H19 expression on maternal allele. On the other hand, on paternally inherited allele ICR is methylated, there's no CTCF binding and enhancers are free to promote Igf2 expression, which has growth promoting function, and H19 is silenced.</p>
<p>In disease, hypo- or hypermethylation at the ICRs can occur, cause loss of gene imprinting and create a disbalance between growth suppressor and growth promoter genes that are being regulated by these ICRs. In H19/Igf2 cluster, <em><strong>DNA hypermethylation of ICR</strong></em> leads to silencing H19 in both paternal and maternal allele and therefore overexpression of Igf2, growth promoter. This condition is associated to <em><strong>Wilm's tumour</strong></em>, a type of childhood kidney tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine in a FDA approved drug, an epigenetic inhibitor belonging to <em><strong>DNA methyltransferase inhibitors</strong></em> (<em><strong>DNMTi</strong></em>). Being a nucleoside analogue, it acts by incorporating itelf into DNA strands during replication and irreversibly blocking DNMT1, enzyme in charge of laying down methylation in newly synthesized DNA strands. This results in decrease in DNA methylation and, having in mind that tumour cells exhibit DNA hypermethylation patterns and replicate at high rate, this can explain decitabine's anti-tumour effect. Decitabine is being used to treat <em><strong>myelodysplastic syndromes</strong></em>.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects on epigenetic makeup. When treating a cancer with an epigenetic drug, there's no selectivity nor specificity for cancer cells and every cell in the body can be potentially affected. Every epigenetic change is then mitotically heritable, that is passed over from mother cell to daughter cells and once occured, an epigenetic change can not be reverted. Special considerations need to be taken when treating younger patients, as the development of germ cells is highly sensitive period epigenetically. It's considered a sensitive period because of the epigenetic reprogramming (removal and resetting of epigenetic marks). Any epigenetic abnormalities made here can potentially effect reproductive potential and future progeny and therefore in such cases treatment with epigenetic drugs is inadvisable.</p></div>
