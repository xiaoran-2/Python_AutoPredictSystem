    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation consists in an addition of a methyl group in a cytosine. In mammals occurs almost exclusively in cytosines followed by guanines, why is called CpG dinuclueotide. These CpGs are found in CpG islands that present high density of CG dinucleotides. They tend to be protected from methylation but if that occurs that means that the gene is silenced.</p>
<p>In cancer we have to consider two types of DNA methylation abnormalities: DNA hypermethylation (Locus specific) and Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation (repetitive elements and intergenic regions). In a normal cell there are hypomethylated CpG island but the genome in general is methylated in the repetitive elements and in the intergenic regions. On the other hand, in a cancer cell the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated and the intergenic region and the repetitive elements are hypomethylated. CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, so these genes can be silenced by DNA methylation and since it is mitotically hereditability that will mean the spreading of tumour.</p>
<p>In what concerns to intergenic regions and repetitive elements they are often methylated. In both DNA methylation maintain genomic stability that prevents chromosomic modifications. The repetitive elements will be silenced to be able to prevent transcriptional interference and since DNA methylation is mutagenic may also prevent transposition - cytosine is change by thymine.</p>
<p>In cancer, these modifications result in genomic instability - deletions, translocations and insertions that lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats, which does not occur in a normal cell since there are heavily methylated and repeats are also heterochromatised. The repeats can also be activated by hypomethylation that can result in activation of neighboring genes. Some tumours are driven by that tumour suppressor hypomethylation that result in a quick and continuous division.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells display loss of imprinting, the genes become expressed for both parental alleles or silenced on both. Lots of genes that are imprinted are involved in growth - promoting or supressing. Hypomethylation can also be found in ICR's. In H19/Igf2 the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. When is unmethylated CTCF will bind the insolater element which means that the enhancers will act on H19 but Igf2 will be silenced. On the paternal allele since it's methylated the enchancers can act in Igf2 and so it will be expressed. On the other hand with loss of imprinting there will be hypomethylation on the maternal allele and so there will be expression of Igf2. It's going to be produced a double dose of Igf2 and since it's growth promoter It's going to be associate with Wilm's tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer can also be a result of epigenetic modifications and so this recent discover leads to a different approach in what concerns to treatment, can be developped a drug treatment. One of these drugs is Decitabine, a DNA-demethylating agent - it inhibits the methylation of DNA. It’s a DNMT inhibitor, used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes since it acts in CpG islands that are hypermethylated in the disease. It’s incorporate into DNA upon replication and so when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, the DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly. It’s replication dependent, which means that cancer cells, since they divide quicker, will be more affected. This is all supported by the fact that epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to the next cells until they are erased, and when that happen they don’t return.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modifications are a mitotically hereditable proccess. In mitosis the epigenetic marks will be copy to daughter cells from the original cell and then they’ll have the same function and the same phenotype. DNA methylation is one epigenetic mark that is laid down by de novo methyltransferases. Will be formed a hemi-methylated DNA and then DNA methylation is maintain by DNMT1. So altering DNA methylation will have enduring effects on the epigenome since this alteration will be maintain for many generations as a result of mitosis.</p>
<p>The environment, more specific chemical exposure, could have an influence in epigenetic control.  In mammals there are sensitive periods when the environment may be able to influence epigenetic control. The first sensitive period is the one that goes from the primordial germ cell development all away through the production of mature eggs and sperm, additionally the second period goes from pre-implantation to post-implantation period.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods could have consequences in what concerns to transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. The modifications pass through generations and may have negative consequences in the offspring, since the epigenetic information that is modified by this drug treatment is transmitted through the gametes. </p></div>
