    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- In normal cells DNA methylation at CpG islands at gene promoters is absent, and therefore genes can be expressed.<br />- In cancer cell we can observe hypermethylation at CpG island, which is mitotically heritable<br />- This hypermethylation prevents the expression of tumor suppressor genes, leading therefore to cell proliferation<br />- In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated in order to prevent aberrant recombination and activation of transposable elements, which are connected with genomic instability<br />- In cancer cells we observe hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements<br />- When intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, they are active and therefore can give rise to illegitimate recombination between repeats and insertion of transposons in genes with consequent disruption.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- Imprint control region of  paternal allele (H19/Igf2 cluster) is hypermethylated and promoter of gene H19 is hypermethylated too, so gene H19 is not expressed. Methylation of ICR prevents protein CTCF from binding, therefore enhancers, located downstream, can contact Igf2 promoter and activate the expression of Igf2 gene.<br />- Imprint control region of  maternal allele (H19/Igf2 cluster) is hypomethylated and promoter of gene H19 is hypomethylated too, so gene H19 is expressed. Protein CTCF binds to hypomethylated ICR preventing the contact of the enhancers, located downstream, with Igf2 promoter. Igf2 gene is therefore unexpressed.<br />- In Wilms tumor ICR on the maternal allele is hypermethylated, therefore maternal allele behaves as paternal allele<br />- Igf2 gene is overexpressed; the higher level of protein Igf2, which is a growth factor, is critical for oncogenesis</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent<br />- Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase, preventing the methylation of the new strand of DNA when the cell divides.<br />- Decitabine can have an antitumor effect because it can epigenetically reactivate silenced tumor suppressor genes in myelodisplastic syndrome progressed to AML</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- The alteration of DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and therefore can also have effects after the end of treatment<br />- During the sensitive periods epigenetic modifiers have huge and long lasting effects <br />- There are 2 sensitive periods during development : early embrionic development and germ cell development<br />- During sensitive periods the epigenetic marks are erased and reprogrammed and the use of an epigenetic modifier drug could interfere with the correct laying down of the epigenetic marks</p></div>
