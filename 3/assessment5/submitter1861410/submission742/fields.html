    <div class="field-value"><p>In non-cancerous tissues CpG islands are normally unmethylated. In cancerous tissues, it has been found that many CpG islands upstream of promoters are methylated. Specifically, in cancer, there is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hyper</span>methylation of tumour supressor genes, resulting in silencing of those suppressor genes. Conversely, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hypo</span>methylation of CpG islands can cause activation of oncogenes. Cancer is thought to be the result of multiple hits to DNA.  Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal tissue. Methylation of these areas maintains genomic integrity by silencing repeats which could otherwise transpose to other areas of the genome causing mutations. Since DNA methylation is mutagenic, it has been proposed that there must be a beneficial reason for methylating areas of DNA, exemplified in the 'genome defense model'. <br />The normal state of methylation of these intergenic and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer. THese areas are hypomethylated which can lead to genomic instability. Reptitive elements can translocate to similar areas of repeats on a different chromosome. Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can contribute to disease not only by facilitating transposition of repeats (genomic instability) but also in a long-range way by genome-wide hypomethylation. This genome-wide hypomthylation can cause a variety of effects such as activation of cryptic promoters of oncogenes or disruption to neighbouring genes. Long range epigenetic alterations (LRES) have been specifically implicated in prostate cancer and are thought to contribute to alterations in nuclear architecture. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted, meaning that the Igf2 gene is methylated on the paternal allele but not on the maternal allele. In the normal state, the cluster on the maternal allele is unmethylated, the maternal Imprint Control Region (ICR) is bound by the insulator protein CTCF, insulating <em>Igf2 </em>from downstream enhancers. The enhancers act on H19 instead.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour is a maternally transmitted imprinted disorder, resulting from various abnormalities in linked <em>H19/Igf2</em> clusters at chromosome 11 including upregulation of the oncogene and growth promoter <em>Igf2</em>. It is caused by methylation of the maternal allele (it behaves like the paternal allele - through mutation and loss of imprinting, uniparental disomy). Loss of imprinting is a hallmark of cancer. </p>
<p>In disease, the maternal H19/Igf2 cluster is hypermethylated. The insulator protein CTCF is not bound to the ICR, and enhancers act upon <em>Igf2</em> which upregulates production of Igf2 protein which is an oncogene. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is also known as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. It is used to treat <span>myelodysplastic syndromes. it acts by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, resulting in hypomethylated DNA. </span></p>
<p><span>In cancer, most disease results from hypermethylation of certain oncogenes which are overexpressed. By inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, decitabine can stop the epigenetics markers of gene activation (hypermethylation for many oncogenes). </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is maintained in daughter cells by DNMT1 which recognises a hemi methylated DNA strand and methylates the corresponding strand. In this way, the epigenetic mark (methylation) is carried from one cell to another. </p>
<p>sensitive periods are those periods of time during which environmental exposures may have persistent effects on the epigenome.</p>
<p>There are two sensitive periods of development: Early development (pre-implantation embryo) and Primordial germ cell development. </p>
<p>Treating patients during this time would be inadvisable due to the possibility of imprinting defects. The long term effects of widespread hypomethylation caused by these drugs is not known and could cause suppression of tumour supressor genes, or other genes which are crucial to embryo or primordial germ cell development. </p></div>
