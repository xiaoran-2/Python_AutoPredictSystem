    <div class="field-value"><p>In DNA methylation, there is an addition of methyl group to the cytosine or adenine DNA nucleotides. it alters the stability of of expression of genes in cells as cells divide and differentiate from embyonic stem cells into specific tissues. DNA methylation typically occurs in CpG dinucleotides. CpG islands methylation plays an important role epigenetic gene control during mammalian development and is frequently altered in disease situations such as cancer. The majority of CpG islands are normally unmethylated but a sizeable fraction is prone to become methylated in various cell types and pathological situations. DNA methylation at CpG islands silences the expression of crirical genes or increases expression of detrimental factors. Thus, its methylation status functions as a<strong> molecular switch</strong> that can turn off or turn on the expression of downstream genes. In cancers,there is a hypermethylation at CpG islands. This hypermethylation is one of the major cause of tumor suppressor gene (such as p53 gene) inactivation. In cancers, CpG islands at 5' region of tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated and their expressions are switched off.</p>
<p>In normal cells, DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated and this methylation maintains genome integrity. This means that DNA in intergenic region and repetitive elements helps in silencing of repeats to prevent transposition. In cancer cells, there is a hypomethylation of DNA at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This hypomethylation is responsible for illegitimate recombination of repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes. Thus, this DNA methylation leads to genomic instability and hence, this disruption contributes to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation pattern of the paternal allele is very active and rapid. It is fastly methylated when the gametes are formed and after fertilization it is rapidly demethylated before the stage of blastocyst. The Igf2 (insulin growth factor) is paternally imprinted gene. There are two differentially methylated regions (DMR1 and DMR2) present on Igf2 locus and they are preferentially methylated on paternal allele. Thus, this Igf2 gene is expressed only in paternal alllele. </p>
<p>The methylation pattern of the maternal allele is passive and slow. It is passively methylated when the gametes are formed and it is demethylaed at the stage of blastocyst after fertilisation. Two DMRs located on Igf2 locus of maternal allele are unmethylated and therefore this gene is maternally silenced. There is a third DMR which is located upstream the gene and methylated maternally and restricted to placenta.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, there is a hypermethylation of imprint control regions and thus, there is loss of imprinting. In this type of tumor, H9 enhancers activates Igf2 gene on both maternal and paternal allele. This activation occurs due to the methylation on maternal allele. In Wilm's tumors, there is overexpression of Igf2 gene and H9 gene is silenced.                    </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA methyl transferases inhibitors. It is used for treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndrome progressed to Acute Myeloid Leukemia. It is replication dependent drug. It is an nucleoside analogue which binds to DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA. Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA.Decitabine is metabolised inside the cell and phosphorylated and then binds to DMNTs. It acts by removing inhibitory methyl groups from the cytosine residues of promoter sequences, which presumably restores downstream gene transcription. Decitabine reactivate the expression of tumor suppressor genes and apoptosis related genes silenced by methylation, thus favoring the induction of apoptosis in tumors. Moreover, induction of DNA damage seems to contribute to their antitumor effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>An epigenome consists of a record of the chemical changes to the DNA histone proteins of an organism, these changes can be passed to an organism's offspring. Changes to the epigenome can result in changes to the structure of chromatin and changes to the function of genome. <span>When methyl groups are added to a particular gene, that gene is turned off or silenced, and no protein is produced from that gene. </span></p></div>
