    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands tend to be located at the promoters of genes. While these islands are typically not methylated, the normal function of the DNA methylation which does occur at CpG islands is to silence gene expression. CpG islands are considerably more likely to be methylated in cancer. One impact of this disruption (increase) in methylation is to silence the action of genes which promote tumor suppression, which in turn enables profileration of tumors.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity and stability. These regions are generally methylated, but in cancer lose methylation. The disruption (loss) of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease through the increased likelihood of adverse events such as recombinations, translocations, insertions and/or deletions of chromosomes, and transcriptional interference. </p>
<p>The combination of DNA hypermethylation specific to CpG islands with hypomethylation elsewhere genome-wide is typically found in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The mechanism of expression in the case of H19/Igf2 cluster involves enhancer blocking. The imprint control region for this cluster on chromosome 11 is unmethylated on the maternal allele, and methylated on the paternal allele. But unmethlyated ICR on the maternal allele is bound by the insulator protein CTCF, which insulates Igf2 from the action of downstream enhancers. On the paternal allele, CTCF cannot bind on the methylated ICR, allowing enhancers to act to promote expression of Igf2. Normally, the net effect is that Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumor is associated with Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, an imprinted disorder in which (whether due to mutation or deletion of the maternal allele, or paternal Uniparental Disomy) BOTH of the alleles express Igf2. At the same time there is no Cdkn1c expression in the linked cluster.</p>
<p>The overexpression of growth promoting oncogene Igf2 together with absence of tumor suppressor Cdkn1c results in a phenotype of fetal and post-natal overgrowth and predisposition to embryonic and childhood tumors (eg Wilm's). Disruption (loss) of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 causes loss of appropriate controls on growth and this dynamic is a hallmark of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Per the articles and our lecture notes, Decitabine is a DNA de-methylating agent, specifically a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. This drug is a "nucleoside analog" which is incorporated into DNA during replication, and then acts to bind and inactivate methylation laid down by DNMT enzymes.</p>
<p>The mechanism of Decitabine's anti-tumor effect in cancer cells is thought to be driven primarily by its reversal of the DNA methylation which silences tumor suppressor genes. When the tumor suppressor genes, which influence cell cycle, apoptosis and/ or DNA repair, are expressed and active, proliferation of tumor cells is reduced.</p>
<p>While Decitabine is not specific to cancer cells, its action is division-dependent, so it has particular impact on those cells (including cancer) which divide rapidly. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since epigenetic marks (including DNA methylation) are mitotically heritable, drugs that act to alter those marks can be anticipated to have enduring effects on the epigenome for the remaining life of the treated organism.</p>
<p>Theoretically, once DNA methylation has been altered by therapeutic agents, those alterations would be incorporated into the epigenome  and replicated in subsequent generations of cells without the need for continuing administration of drugs (though there might be some natural random degradation of methylation with aging).</p>
<p>Sensitive periods include those periods when epigenetic reprogramming is occuring during germ cell development and early development; there is also a sensitive period leading up to puberty when germ cells undergo a further process of maturation.</p>
<p>While patient treatment at any stage of development may have unanticipated side effects or consequences, there is particular risk during sensitive periods, when the organism or germ cells of future generations are most acutely sensitive to epigenetic regulation. Drugs which alter DMA methylation  promote genomic instability throughout the organism. While we might predict outcomes like imprinted orders and cancer in some circumstances, there are many unknowns about the full range of possible impacts; mice in which all DNA methylation is eliminated do not survive gestation.</p>
