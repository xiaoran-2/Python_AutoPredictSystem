    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to silencing of gene expression, which is why most CpG islands remain unmethylated. In cancer, CpG islands are oftentimes hypermethylated. Sometimes, these hypermethylated CpG islands result in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, disrupting a cell's normal relgulatory mechanisms and allowing tumor formation to occur. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation's function is to maintain genomic instability and to protect the DNA from transposons. In the case of cancer, oftentimes the normal operation of intergenic and repetitve element methylation is disrupted and genome-wide hypomethylation is observed. This results in genomic instability as well as activation of oncogenes (genes with potential to cause cancer), contributing to the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In many cancer cells, there is loss of imprinting due to hypermethylation of imprinting control regions (ICRs). Oftentimes, genes which should exhibit monoallelic (single parental allele) expression end up expressing both parent alleles or are silent from both parent alleles. This is because many imprinted genes are involved in growth promotion/suppresion.</p>
<p>In the case of lgf2 in a normal organism, the paternal allele is hypermethylated, preventing CTCF binding and allowing the enhancers to increase the expression of lgf2. In contrast, the maternal allele is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind and causing the enhancers to act on H19. This results in a silenced lgf2 from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>This goes wrong in Wilm's tumour, where both the paternal and maternal alleles are hypermethylated. In this case, both alleles express lgf2. SInce lgf2 is growth promoting, this causes the growth of Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (aka Dacogen) is an epigenetic inhibitor which belongs in the class of drugs known as DNA Methyl Transferase inhibitors (DNMTis) . Decitabine impacts DNA methylation by irreversibly binding DNMTs after they are incorperated into the DNA. Thus, the cell must be replicating for Decitabine to have an effect. This is a desirable property as it causes Decitabine to have a stronger affect on cancer cells, which are rapidly dividing and will be more severly effected. At an effective dose, Decitabine seems to be causing a decrease in DNA methylation. We are currently not very clear why Decitabine is effective, but a strong theory is that since CpG island hypermethylation oftentimes has a poor prognosis for certain tumours, Decitabine's demethylating effects improves the prognosis of the patient.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is unlikely that DNA methylation is inherited from the parents, so if there is another mechanism of enduring epigenetic effects from methylation, it is more possible that a messenger carries the mark and re-establishes the methylation in the gametes.</p>
<p>Another way DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome is if it is not completely reset during epigenetic reprogramming. This causes transgenerational inheritance through the gametes (germ cells). Incomplete reprogramming can occur if the sensitive period is interrupted or disturbed.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is when significant epigenetic reprogramming occurs. This happens during gametogenesis (formation of gametes) and early preimplantation development (formation of blastocysts). If a patient is treated with epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods, the drugs may interfere with epigenetic reprogramming and cause incomplete epigenetic reprogramming. In addition to persisting the parental DNA methylation, this may lead to the cell failing to become pluripotent and cause an array of downstream problems.</p>
