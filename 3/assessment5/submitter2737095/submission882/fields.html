    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation refers to the attachment of a methyl (CH3) group to the 5' site of a DNA nucleotide.  In mammals, this is almost exclusively seen at CpG dinucleotides.  Most CpG islands will be unmethylated in each cell, with different cell types showing different patterns of CpG methylation.  the CpG methylation is preserved through mitosis, allowing daughter cells to maintain the differentiation of their parent cell.  CpG island methylation acts to silence the associated genes by preventing transcription at the gene promotor.  It is also essential for dose compensation in females by silencing of the second female chromosome, where CpG island methylation is seen in all the islands of the inactive chromosome.</p>
<p>In cancer, the normal pattern of methylation is disrupted, with an increase in methylation seen at CpG islands and a decrease in methylation overall throughout the genome.</p>
<p>The methylation of CpG islands is synonymous with suppression / silencing of the associated genes.  In cancer, increased CpG island methylation can silence the expression of tumour suppressor genes, forming one of the “hits” required for tumoregenesis to occur, as described in the Knudson hypothesis.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation can also be demonstrated in areas surrounding CpG islands (CpG shores); there is now evidence that this may be a better predictor of gene expression than island methylation itself.</p>
<p>Examples of tumour suppressor gene silencing, which can occur via CpG island hypermethylation, include RB1 in retinoblastoma and BRCA1 in breast cancer</p>
<p>Reduced methylation in intragenic regions, particularly in repetitive elements can contribute to genomic instability.  The reduced methylation allows for expression of repetitive elements which are able to insert around the genome, creating abbarent transloactions, interrupting the DNA sequences and expression of genes and contributiung to the breakdown of normal nuclear function.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal genome, expression of Igf2 is imprinted (silenced) in the maternal allele and expression of H19 is imprinted in the paternal allele; this is controlled by an imprint control region.</p>
<p>If the imprint control region is unmethylated, as is the case in the maternal allele, then it allows CTCF protein to bind and act as an insulator, preventing the downstream enhancers from acting on Igf2; instead, the enhancers act to promote H19 expression.</p>
<p>The imprint control region is normally methylated in the paternal allele, allowing the enhancers to promote Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In malignancy, the maternal allele displays hypermethylation at the imprint control region, preventing CTCF from binding and allowing Igf2 to be expressed from both maternal and paternal alleles (H19 expression is also lost, from the maternal allele).</p>
<p>As Igf-2 is a growth promoter (insulin-like growth factor 2), the double dose expression deregulates cell growth and reproduction in an  oncogenic fashion and is associated with Wilm’s tumour, a renal tumour of childhood.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a demethylating (DNMT inhibitor) agent: it acts as a nucleoside analogue and incorporates into the normal DNA sequence of the cell.  This means that as the cell enters mitosis and the epigentic markers are copied to the daughter strands, it will be read by the cellular apparatus as if it is part of the host genome.</p>
<p>Decitabine acts in a replication dependant fashion, binding and inhibiting the progress of DNMT along the genome and hence reducing methylation throughout the genome.  As epigentic changes are mitotically heritable, the changes in methylation triggered by decitabine are mitotically heritable to all daughter cells.</p>
<p>The antitumour effect of decitabine is thought to be related to the genome wide reduction in methylation (which is increased in all cancers so far studied).  This allows for normal expression of tumour supressor genes which may have been previously silenced by this abarrent methylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenome is known to be mitotically heritable.  As the DNA replicates, the epigenetic markers are copied from the parent strand on to the daughter strand allowing for conservation of the epigenome.  Alterations to the epigenome, be they abarrent alterations that accumulate during neoplasia or therapeutically induced by demethylating agents such as decitibine, are preserved in daughter cells of the effected progenitor.</p>
<p>Whereas this can be beneficial in cancer, synergising with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy and potentially reducing the doses required, it means that care must be taken when treating patients during epigenetically sensitive periods, in which epigentic markers are being laid down.</p>
<p>The two main sensitive periods in human beings are during gestation (during gastrulation) when the markers are first laid down, and during childhood when the germ cells are developing.  Treatment during development of the primordial germ cells could have profound consequences on the epigenome of the childs oocytes or sperm (depending on sex) and subsequent impact on the patient's fertillity and the health of their offspring.</p>
<p>For example, disruption of methylation during the normal imprinting process could put the offspring at increased risk of imprinting disorders such as angelman's, prader willi, and Beckwith Widemann syndromes.</p></div>
