    <div class="field-value"><p>In genome, regions containing high frequency of CpG sites are called CpG islands. CpG islands are often at promoters of genes. The methylated CpG island (meCpG) silences gene expression by two mechanisms. First, the meCpG can be bound by meCpG binding proteins e.g. MeCP1 &amp; 2, which have transcriptional repression domain and can recruit other factors that compress the chromatin. By this mechanism forms a repressive chromatin structure is formed to supress gene transcription. Second, in rare cases, meCpG can inhibit the binding of transcription factors, which suppresses gene expression. However, the CpG islands are usually unmethylated in genomes of normal cells. Cancer cells show an increase of methylation rate in CpG islands. This hypermethylation is locus specific, occurring on CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes. The DNA methylation silences tumor suppressor genes, resulting in uncontrollable growth of cancer cells.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the global methylation of the whole genome is reduced in cancer cells. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells, to maintain genomic integrity. DNA methylation can silence repetitive elements, or it can mutate the sequence of the repeats (from meC to T) to prevent transposition. This avoids transcriptional interference from strong promoters. The methylation of repeats can also prevent illegitimate recombination. In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This can cause combination between repeats and activate repeats and transposition, increasing genomic instability. As a result, cancer cells often show abnormal karyotype, caused by deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertion of large chromosome regions. The hypomethylation can also activate cryptic promoters and disrupt neighboring genes, resulting in oncogene activation, which promote growth of cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can be used as parental-specific allele marks, these marks are stable and heritable. The imprinted genes have allele-specific DNA methylation regions, called imprint control regions (ICRs). ICRs are established in the germline by de novo DNA methyltransferases and is maintained throughout the development. The mechanism used by H19/Igf2 gene is insulator model of imprinting, mediated by a CTCF-dependent insulator. H19 gene is maternally expressed, Igf2 gene is paternally expressed, both share downstream enhancers. On the maternal allele, CTCF binds to the binding sites between H19 and Igf2, generating an insulator that prevents downstream enhancers from activating Igf2. Thus, the H19 is expressed and Igf2 is blocked. On the paternal allele, DNA methylation at the ICR blocks the binding of CTCF, allowing the access of enhancers to Igf2 gene. Without CTCF binding, the DNA methylation spread to the H19 promoter, silenceing H19. In Wilm’s tumour, there is a loss of imprinting in H19/Igf2 maternal allele. ICR at H19/Igf2 locus is hypermethylated also at maternal alleles, silencing H19 gene and activating Igf2 gene, resulting in overexpression of Igf2. Since Igf2 promotes cell growth, overexpression of Igf2 gene causes uncontrolled cell growth, forming tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic alterations are reversible, drugs targeting epigenetic machinery could be used for treating cancers. Also, drugs targeting enzymatic epigenetic regulators are more easily to develop because enzymes are more readily targeted than RNAs or other regulators. Decitabine inhibits the function of DNMT (DNA methyltransferases). DNMTs transfer methyl group to DNA, so decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, thus a DNA-demethylating agent. Decitabine is a nuceloside analogue which can irreversibly bind to DNMTs. Upon replication it is incorporated into DNA of daughter strand, and when DNMTs bind to Decitabine, they can no longer be released. Therefore, thefunction of Decitabine is replication dependent. The effect of Decitabine is dose-dependent. At high doses, it is toxic and non-specific, generating severe side effects. However, at much lower doses, the effect of Decitabine is specific and anti-neoplastic, thus can be used to stop tumor growting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic marks allow each cell type to express restricted subsets of genes. The epigenetic state is mitotic heritable. It ensures the same sets of genes are expressed in daughter cells, maintaining cell identity and tissue homogeneity. Epigenetic reprogramming actively ocurs in primordial germ cell development, early development and specific stages of cell differentiation. These periods are sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming. Disrupting epigenetic reprogramming during sensitive periods causes epigenetic abnormalities and imprinting disorders. Therefore, treating patients during sensitive periods with epigenetic drugs affects the normal process of epigenetic reprogramming. In somatic cells, during cell division, epigenetic marks are also passed by to daughter cells, and this process could also be disrupted by drugs. Thus the epigenetic drugs affect tumor cells, but also germ cells and somatic cells. Through cell division, the disrupted epigenetic state is inherited by daughter cells, changing the features of these cells in the long run. This disruption in tumor cells could help treating cancer, as Dr Baylin saw in his study, but the disruption in normal cells can result in tissue heterogeneity and abnormal oocytes and sperms. By affect the inhebility of epigenetic marks the drugs generate long term consequences even after stop taking them.</p></div>
