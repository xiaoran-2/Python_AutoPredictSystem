    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence the genes whose promoters are associated with those islands. The genes to be silenced depend on the cell type. In general, CpG islands are sparsely methylated in normal tissue. But in cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands leads to silencing more genes than usual, including many tumor suppressor genes. This makes it easier for the cancer cells to grow and replicate. Mitotic heritability of DNA methylation marks allows the cancer cells to perpetuate this trait, as an alternative to genetic mutation, which happens more rarely, as it is harder to achieve. In cancer, entire contiguous sets of CpG islands are often hypermethylated, along with the “shores,” i.e. the ~2kb regions on both sides of the set.</p>
<p>On the contrary, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be heavily methylated in normal tissue but hypomethylated in cancer. In normal tissue, DNA methylation of repetitive elements suppresses their expression and potential illegitimate recombination, whereby some portions of the repetitive elements, called transposons, may copy themselves into other parts of the genome during cell replication. Disruption of DNA methylation in repetitive elements, therefore, allows transposons to be active, makes illegitimate recombination possible, and thus induces genomic instability. DNA methylation in intergenic regions normally silences cryptic promoters and splice sites. Its disruption in cancer leads to transcriptional interference from the strong cryptic promoters and the resultant deficiency of expression of the genes with affected intergenic regions, the end result being, again, genomic instability.</p>
<p>It is likely that, for cancer to develop, a combination of these factors must come into play, in order to be able to efficiently overcome the multiply redundant genomic defenses—a concept also known as the Knudson hypothesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer in many ways. Depending on the affected cluster, this may occur through DNA hypermethylation or hypomethylation of the imprint control region. In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the former mechanism leads to the Wilm's tumor, as follows.</p>
<p>The paternal allele of this cluster usually has its ICR methylated. As a result, the CTCF transcriptional repressor protein cannot bind to the ICR. Further, the DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, silencing it, so that the enhancer factors can reach the Igf2 gene. As a result, the Igf2 gene is expressed by the paternal allele. On the contrary, the maternal allele has its ICR cluster unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind to it and block the enhancers from reaching Igf2. Thus, the enhancers ends up transcribing H19 instead, and Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>If the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on both alleles, then the maternal allele also ends up expressing Igf2 while not expressing H19. This leads to overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth factor, resulting in Wilms' tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-hypomethylating agent. Being a cytidine analog, it can be incorporated into DNA strands, where it replaces cytosine. But, due to its additional ribose ring, it can't be methylated, while still allowing transcription to proceed. Thus, administration of decitabine leads to global hypomethylation of the cell's genome. This can be therapeutically useful in cancer patients whose tumors rely heavily on tumor suppressor genes being silenced by DNA methylation of their promoters' CpG islands. To date, decitabine has been found to be effective in treatment of myelodisplastic syndromes (a class of blood tumors).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Therefore, altering DNA methylation leads to the daughter cells inheriting the altered methylation patterns, which persist through further cell divisions, potentially to the end of life of the organism. In particular, such changes may activate or silence various genes that affect the efficacy of the standard chemotherapy treatment.</p>
<p>However, there are time periods during which most of the epigenetic marks are erased and new ones established (with few exceptions, such as methylation of repetitive elements, which tend to persists always, and gene imprinting during early embryonic development). These so-called sensitive periods include the period of early embryonic development and the period of primordial germ cell formation.</p>
<p>Because the changes to the epigenome during these sensitive periods are so much more radical, drug treatment that alters the workings of epigenetic machinery would therefore have a much broader effect during these periods. An incomplete and/or aberrant epigenetic cell reprogramming may lead to potentially severe side-effects. In particular, if the primordial germ cells develop abnormally, this may have repercussions even for the affected patient's progeny.</p></div>
