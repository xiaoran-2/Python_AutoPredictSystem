<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">CpG islands are clusters of CpG  dinucleotides which as such could be methylated in a mitoticaly heritable way. These islands are often promoters of gene and their methylation will silent the associated gene expression. This by condensing the chromatin helped by a then bindable MeCP protein or by prohibiting the necessary transcription factor binding to a methylated promoter. Most CpG islands are normally unmethylated with rare exception for specific cell types. Often in cancer, specific CpG are more likely to be hypermethylated silencing tumor suppressor genes. This may be one or more of the necessary cell alteration leading to cancer complementing the genetic mutation  also often found in cancer. These epimutation are mitotically heritable and acquire 'selection' advantage by knocking these tumor suppressor genes. They appear to be  often more present than genetic mutation in cancer. The set of affected(silenced)  genes is used  to characterize the specific cancer instance allowing tuning of treatment and prognosis. Contrary to normal hypomethylation of CpG islands in cells, intergenic and repetitive elements are normally hypermethylated. This is important to maintain genomic stability by avoiding otherwise too easy recombination of these too similar repeats. Also  because methylated cytosine is mutagenic, a mutated repeat ( cytosine transformed into thymine) is more  likely to prevent transposition by confusion of repeat.  All cancer appear to present more or less an hypomethylation of intergenic and repetitive element proportional to tumorgenicity. This lead to unwanted activation of repeats, to spurious activation of cryptic promoters and to unmatched recombination and transposition. And so,  this acquired genomic instability of the cell is an important facilitator of cancer initiation.</p></div>

answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Alteration of imprinting related epigenetic mark could lead to cancer. An example is the Igf2/H19 cluster. Igf2 is a fetal grow factor, normally expressed from the paternal allele. The cluster itself is constituted from the Igf2 gene, an imprinting control region (ICR) , the H19 gene and a pair of enhancers. Normally the ICR on the  paternal allele is methylated, while it is unmethylated on the maternal allele. The unmethylated ICR allow an 'insulator' protein (CTCF) to bind, isolating the Igf2 gene from the enhancers, effectively silencing it on martenal allele. On paternal allele, the methylation of the ICR avoid CTCF binding, allowing the expression of Igf2 by enhancers. Also the ICR methylation spread to the H19 gene silencing it on paternal allele. Aberrant hypermethylation of the maternal ICR prevent CTCF binding on both allele leading to overexpression of Igf2.</p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">This Igf2 overexpression is a factor of Wilm's tumor : a kidney cancer</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Decitabine is an DNA methyltransferase(DNMT) inhibitor.Decitabine inhibit DNMT effectively unmethylating the DNA copy during DNA replication. Normally, DNMT is responsible for the methylation of the twin GpC site of a replicated CpG methylated pair.</p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Decitabine, is a citidine analogs. This nucleoside analogs when incorporated in the ADN, bind irreversibly to DNMT making it unavailable for further action.</p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">While the mechanism of action of DNMT inhibitors are  unclear, we can see two anti-tumor action :</p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">First, excessive or total unmethylation of dividing cell attack the most dividing cells : tumor cells. This is a classic chemotherapeutic mechanism.</p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Second, unmethylation of hypermethylated tumor suppressor genes could lead  to the  recovering of these tumor suppressor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and for some genes heritable between meiosis, and for both reason has an enduring effect.</p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Sensitive periods are period during which active reprogramming of the epigenome are occurring : the first period is between  primordial gem cells development and  eggs or  gamete  maturation included, the second is between  fecundation and epiblast included. </p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Treating patient during one of these period (primordial gems cells) could interact with natural development of the methylation pattern of their gem cells and could have a reproductive impact.</p>
