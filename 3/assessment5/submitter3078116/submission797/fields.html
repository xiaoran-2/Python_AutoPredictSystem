    <div class="field-value"><p> Regions in the genome which are CpG rich are called CpG islands and are usually found in the promoters of genes .CpG islands are normally kept unmethylated for proper gene expression.</p>
<p><strong>In normal cell CpG island methylation</strong> (a)enables differentiation and development by expressing only a restricted(tissue specific) subset of genes in each cell type and the other genes are silenced by CpG Island methylation.(b)X-Chromosome Inactivation &amp; genomic Imprinting.</p>
<p><strong>Disruption of CpG island DNA methylation in Cancer:</strong>In cancer cells CpG islands are hypermethylated and cause silencing of the underlying gene.Most of the tumour types shows CpG Island Methylator Phenotype(CIMP).CIMP is unique to tumour type and progress with time.</p>
<p><strong>Hypermethylation of CpG Island leads to silencing of tumour suppressor gene</strong>(which controll cell cycle,apoptosis&amp;DNA repair) and hence result in uncontrolled cell division i.e cancer.</p>
<p>Methylated CpG(metCpG)can bound by meCpG binding proteins(eg.MeCP1&amp;2).These proteins can recruit other factors at its transcriptional repression domain which results in condensing of the chromatin and silencing of the gene.</p>
<p><strong>Normal function of DNA methylation in Intergenic regions(IR) &amp; repetitive elements(RE)</strong>:is to maintain genomic and chromosomal integrity.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in IR is requied for siliencing of Cryptic splice site &amp;Cryptic transription sites and DNA methylation in RE is required for silencing the repeats to <em>prevent transposition,</em>avoid<em> transcriptional influence</em> from strong promoters and prevent<em> illegitimate recombinations.</em></p>
<p><strong>Disruption of DNA methylation in IR &amp;RE in Cancer:</strong>Hypomethylation of IR and RE is common epigenetic event in cancer which progress with time.Hypomethylation of these regions leads to(a) upregulation of the actively silenced genes which leads to lots of trancriptional aberrations and (b)open access to the chromatin region which results in illegitimate recombinations.</p>
<p><strong>Hypomethylation of IR &amp;RE results in:</strong> activation of cryptic promoters &amp; disrupting neighbouring genes,activation of repeats and transposition Illegitimate recombination.All these events leads to genomic instability and increased genetic mutations which results in causing cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>IGF2 and H19 are two imprinted genes located adjacent to each other at 11p15.5 chromosome and share the same ICR(imprinted controll region).</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Paternal Allele :</span></strong><span>ICR is methylated at paternal allele(paternally imprinted) Methylation at ICR blocks the binding of CTCF protein .In the absence of CTCF protein the methylation spreads to the promoter of </span><span> </span><span>H19 gene and leads to silencing of this gene.Enhancers get access tio Igf2 gene and increase the expression of Igf2 which promote the growth.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Maternal Allele :</span></strong><span>ICR is unmethylated at maternal allele which allows the binding of CTCF (insulating protein).CTCF insulate the Igf2 from enhancers .So enhancers loops to H19 and increase its expression.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Wilm's Tumour :</span></strong><span>In Wilm's tumour the imprinting of Igf2 is relaxed(Loss Of Imprinting) , that is the normally silent maternal allele becomes active and the gene is biallelically expressed .Biallelic Igf2 expression in Wilms tumours is accompanied by de novo methylation and silencing of the maternal H19 allele.ICR in maternal allele is methylated and now the maternal allele also behave as paternal allele and express Igf2.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Disrupting Imprinting cause :</span></strong><span>Igf2 promotes growth so it is an oncogene,when it is expressed biallelically there is an upregulation of Igf2.</span></p>
<p><span>Overexpression of  Igf2 leads to uncontrolled cell divison. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza′-2-deoxycytidine) is<strong> DNA methyl Transferase Inhibitor(DNMTi) </strong>also known as DNA demethylating agents.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Decitabine:</strong>Decitabine is a neucleoside analogue which get incorporated in DNA during replication(It is replication dependent).</p>
<p>When DNMT comes along for methylation it get binds to the incorporated DNMTi <em>irreversibly</em> hence DNMT is no longer available so it result in hypometylation of the gene.</p>
<p><strong>Anti -tumour Effects:</strong>Decitabine is used to treat Myelodysplastic syndrome which progressed to AML.</p>
<p>Global hypomethylation, likely reactivate expression of multiple silenced genes including oncogenes and tumour suppressors genes.Demethylation could therefore cause both therapeutic and deleterious effects.</p>
<p>Lower dose of Decitabine had shown antineoplastic effects.</p>
<p>It have no specificity and hit almost all dividing cells but is mostly effective on rapidly dividing tumour cells.</p>
<p>Transient exposure of cells to low (relatively non-toxic) doses of Decitabine could induce a “memory” response with sustained reduction in CpG island methylation and reactivation of expression of previously silenced genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Altering DNA Methylation:</strong>DNA methylation can be considered a long-term, relatively stable(mitoticaly inheritable) epigenetic trait, the effects of which can contribute to maintenance of the cellular phenotype.DNA methylation is a nongenetic trait which can be passed from cell to cell and also found involved in transgenerationl epigenetic inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitive Period:</strong>This is the timeperiod during development when active remodelling of the epigenetic marks takes place.Previously laid epigenetic marks are erased and then re-established.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitive Periods of Development:</strong>There are two SensitivePeriods</p>
<p>(a)<strong>Gametogenesis</strong>:During the primordial germ cell development their original biparental DNA methylation patterns is erased and re-established based on the sex of the transmitting parent..</p>
<p>(b)<strong>Preimplantation</strong>:After fertilisation parental genomes are epigeneticaly reprogrammed<span>(except differentially methylated regions associated with imprinted genes) to maintain cellular totipotency.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Treating patients during sensitive period:</strong> Cancer drugs aims to reverse the epigenetic marks rather than killing the tumour cells but they are not specific.These drugs hit all the dividing cells but during  the normal phase these hits don't have much consequences. </span></p>
<p><span>The epigenetic modification during sensitive period have a<em> wide range of long lasting side effects becuse it is the time of reprogamming the epigenome</em>.</span>So the side effects of the drug on young children and pregnant women should be considered .</p></div>
