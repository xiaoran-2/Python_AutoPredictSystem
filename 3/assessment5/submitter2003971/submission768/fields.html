    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Generally CpG islands are not methylated.  However the intergenic regions and the repeats are generally hypermethylated, thus silenced and allowing for a stable genome.  When the methylations patterns are changed in a normal cell then the genome behaves differently, both locally and genome wide. Wrong methylation patterns can cause imbalances in the normal healthy cell processes and loss of imprinted marks. This allows daughter cells to continue the errors.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Methylation patterns change, increasing with time or age, during normal cell conductance and also in cancer dependent on the type of tumor, the stage of the tumor. </span><span>Mistakes, errors, or “hits”(Knudson Hypothesis), including the incorrect methylation pattern of a single gene, a panel of genes and shores or hypomethylation of the repeats, can be seen in cancer and disease.  </span></p>
<div><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The hypermethylation of normally non-methylated locus specific CpG islands can lead the cascade of events that can contribute to cancer in some cells. Some usually expressed genes are silenced and the opposite; some normally silenced genes are expressed.  The methylation changes can spread to CpG islands surrounding area, the shores, to further effect errant expression.   The silencing of tumor suppressor genes and the increase of growth factor cause disruptive cell growth. Some groups of CpG islands are super methylated, CIMP, and related to several different types of cancer. Conversely if a CpG promoter, sparsely populated with CpG islands, that <em>normally</em> <em>suppresses</em> tumors by being methylated is vulnerable to change and hypomethylated, oncogenes can be created.  </span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>When the large number of repeats and intergenic regions are abnormally hypomethylated they are activated and create instability in the now open accessible genome by "jumping" around and causing errors; deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.(week 6, lecture 4).   Now these newly created non-normal combinations in the damaged genome and on the chromosomes can result in cancer, genetic disorders, mutations, more changes and death. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>In a normal cell the maternal and paternal alleles at the Imprint Control Regions of the H19/Igf2 cluster are different.  The methylation pattern is different.  In a normal maternal allele the imprint is for a CTCF “insulator element” (week 6, lecture 3), in order to keep the bind site unmethylated and allow H19 to be expressed and enhanced.  H19 a lncRNA is a “reservoir for a particular miRNA” (week 4, lecture 4).  CTCF protein also insulates against the enhancers by not allowing access to lgf2.  In a normal male allele the imprint site is methylated, CTCF does not bind and H19 is methylated downstream and silenced.  So in the paternal allele the enhancers can access and increase the lgf2.  </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In Wilms tumor cells the maternal allele is methylated at the binding site which causes both alleles to act like a paternal allele.  This means the insulin like growth factor 2 is expressed and not inhibited at all.  The epigenetic imprinting marks are not maintained on the maternal allele, they are lost in concert with hypermethylation. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This faulty H19/igf2 cluster promotes unwanted growth; loss of the normal imprinted maternal allele allows cancer cells to rapidly develop and divide, unrestricted and enhanced. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Decitabine is a de novo DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  It belongs to the drug class Nucleoside Metabolic </span>Inhibitor and is approved by the FDA as a chemotherapy for treatment of the blood disorder Myelodysplastic Syndromes.  Decitabine works to hypomethylate the disorder's hypermethylated CpG islands and is instrumental in returning normal gene expression, causing tumor cell opoptosis and extending lives.  Decitabine is currently used in small doses configured as an analog to become part of the cancer cell's DNA after the cell has divided.  It is used to stop a methyltransferase from copying by firmly binding. By stopping the methylation of daughter cells, the cancer is not able to continue through that lineage.  Cancer cells replicate quickly but because Decitabine adheres, targets DNMT1 and acts as a roadblock to new cancer cell creation, the damaged tumor cells die. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr. Stephen Bayin describes how a combination of drugs given to cancer patients did not change the cancer at first for all participants but after stopping the drug and continuing on to chemotherapy an improvement was noticed.  This allowed a theory that the drugs enabled the chemo to work because of perhaps epigenetic changes made in the cells of the cancer itself:  Changing cancer epigenetically.  Decitabine is another example of epigenetic altering drug.  This drug did not allow the methyltransferase to continue through the daughter cells of cancer cells.  </p>
<p>Although several of these drugs work well with older patients and several types of tumors, these patients are well past the sensitive childhood, puberty, child bearing, breast feeding and ultra sensitive primordial germ cell development (i.e. x chromosome silencing) and implantation periods.  A problem might also come up when the epigenetic changes alter the methylation in a normal dividing cell.</p>
<p>Not enough is known yet of the possible harm to the "epigenetic machinery" (week 6, lecture 8) of young cells.  During the sensitive times the viability and health of the cells depend on normal non or methylation distribution patterns in epigenetic reprogramming.  These chemo drugs can alter methylation patterns and perhaps result in critical errors. </p></div>
