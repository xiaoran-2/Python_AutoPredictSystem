    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a process involving the addition of a methyl group to the adenine or cytosine nucleotides. It is known that in mammals, CpG islands are clusters containing unmethylated CpGs. When cancer appears, gene promoted CpG islands are highly ypermethylated and as a result they are silenced in the level of transcription. This is an epigenetic change, that can be passed on to daughter cells and so, it causes the affected cells to divide more and not become apoptotic therefore causing diseases and cancer. In normal cells, intergenic regions and reppetitive elements are hypermethylated whereas in cancer these regions are hypomethylated. This disruption that causes hypomethylation is something that progresses over time and it causes genomic instability (wrong recombinations deletions and translocations of chromosomes)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine is a drug used in treating cancer. Chemically, it is a cytidine analog. Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent and it acts by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase which is known to methylate tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells and maintaining this methylation. Furthermore, Decitabine is considered to be an epigenetic drug, a drug that performs epigenetic changes on tumor cells so that they are more susceptible to other drugs and mechanisms used to treat cancer, as epigenetic drugs cause inheritable changes that may have the potential to eliminate cancer without affecting the genome. This is truly a breakthrough in the field of epigenetics and medicine.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The two genes are part of the chromosome 7 and are regulated by two regions. Igf2 is regulated by a set of tissue-specific enhancers and H19 is regulated by <span>a differentially methylated region. In normal cells, s<span>everal sites upstream of H19 are methylated (Igf2 is expressed) on the paternal allele and unmethylated (Igf2 not expressed) on the maternal allele. When cancer exists, the maternal chromosome gets the paternal type of <span>methylation of the H19 promoter, in which Igf2 is turned on, and H19 is turned off, causing increased cell growth and therefore cancer. Wilm's tumor is caused when the maternal copy of Igf2 is activated, while the maternal copy of H19 is silenced and this is called loss of imprinting.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs can have effects on cells that last beyond the period of treatment and this is because they cause epigenetic changes in the genome which means that those changes do not cease to exist and are heritable so that they can be passed to the daughter cells. A sensitive period refers to the important periods of childhood development and they consist of a childs birth until the age of six or seven in which the child aqcuired certain skills. It would not be good to treat patients during those periods, as the drugs used inhibit the epigenetic machinery, causing lots of trouble with the normal and expected development of the child.</p></div>
