    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of CpG islands is to inhibit expression of genes that are not needed at specific tissues. In cancer, there is hypermethylation at CpG islands that inhibit expression of tumor supressor genes. This hypermethylation results in uncontroled cell proliferation that contribute to the disease. The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to condense chromatin regions that include repetitive elements and to silence their potential to disrupt the normal transcription from neighbouring genes. In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated and therfore there is disregulation of gene expression by activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes. These aberations will contribute to the disease by inhibition of tumor suppressor gene expression and induction of oncogene expression. In addition, this hypomethylation results in illegitimate recombination between repetitive elements. This abberation contribute to the disease by generating abnormal karyotype that includes deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.         At last, hypomethylation of repetitive elements results in their activation which leads to their transposition into other locations in the genome. This can lead to destroying the nomral structure of genes or to imped their regulation. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The patternal H19/Ig2 cluster is DNA methylated in the intergenic region between the Igf2 and the H19 alleles. This methylation prevent binding of the intergenic region by CTCF insulator. Therfore,  the enhacer that is located downstream to the H19 allele can become closer to to the promoter of Igf2 and enable it to be transcribed to RNA. Normally, the maternal intergenic region is not methylated  and therfore CTCF can bind it. Because of this CTCF binding,  the enhancer remains far away from the maternal Igf promoter and therfore the maternal Igf allele can not be expressed. In Wim's tumor the maternal  intergenic region is also methylated which prevent CTCF binding and therfore there is expression of Igf2 from both patternal and maternal alleles. Because the Igf2 protein promote cell proliferation the expression of Igf2  from both alleles (the maternal in addition to the patternal) will result in its overexpression. Therfore, the cells will proliferate abnormally fast which contribute to the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylation drug (from the Economist,"Cancer's epicentre", Apr 7th 2012).  Decitabine cause to a reduce in the DNA methylation level  in hypermethylated CpG islands. Because hypermethylated CpG islands located at promoters of tumor supressor genes in cancer, their expression level decrease. Therefore, treatment with Decitabine can increase the expression levels of the silenced tumor suppresor genes toward the normal state. The result of this function is anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methyls are located  in the DNA in a symmetric manner in relative to its two strands. The symmetric nature of the methylation enable it  to be completely self-renewed after each mitotic cells division. This is done by the enzyme DNMT1. A sensitive period is when epigentic reprogramming is occuring by passive or active removal of methyls from the DNA. There are two sensitive peroids that occurs during development: 1. During the time between the egg was fertalized and the blastocyt was generated. 2. At mid gestation in the production process of promordial germ cells in the embryo.</p>
<p>Treating patients by epigenetic drugs during sensitive peroids is inadvisable because it can damage the epigenetic reprogramming in the early embryo and/or the epigenetic reprogramming of  primordial germ cells. This might cause to abnormal development of the embryo or his/her offsprings.</p></div>
