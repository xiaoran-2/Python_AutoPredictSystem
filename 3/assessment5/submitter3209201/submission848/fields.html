    <h1>Submission 848 from Anon (session_user_id: f60619c61b1e44c317071e9095b9d0b7e08f13dc)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation status can have effects that last longer than their administration due to the fact that these epigenetic changes in DNA methylation are maintained and carried to daughter cells during subsequent cell divisions.  Thus the beneficial effect remains for a longer time. The DNA marks must be actively erased in order for the effect to be terminated.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a time of epigenetic reprogramming when clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks (eg. methylation, acetylation) occurs.  There are two epigenetic sensitive periods: one during pre-implantation development from the zygote to the blastocyte (remove paternal and maternal marks in order to lay down lineage-specific marks) and one during primordial germ cell development (remove somatic marks in order to lay down germ cell-specific marks).  During these times, the genome is progressively demethylated. You would not want to treat patients during these sensitive periods with drugs that alter DNA methylation as this would interfere with the endogenous methylation process, and result in potentially decreased ability of the patient to produce offspring in the future, or if given to a pregnant patient, would increase the likelihood of producing offspring with imprint disorders or other conditions.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in ~60% of gene promoters.  The normal function of CpG islands is to regulate transcription starts.  Their effects on chromatin structure and interactions with binding proteins causes transcription initiation at the genes which they regulate.  CpG islands are normally kept free of DNA methylation, allowing transcription to occur.  However during cancer these CpG island become hypermethylated, thus stopping transcription starts.  This inhibition of transcription starts is thought to silence tumor suppressor genes and to alter cell cycle regulation and DNA repair, events that would facilitate the cancer phenotype and contribute to the disease.  These unusually high methylated CpG islands have been called CIMPs (CpG island methylator phenotype); these were first discovered in colon cancer and are now known to be associated with other types of cancers.</p>
<p>Most of genome is made up of intergenic regions or repetitive intervals (not CpG islands).  Under normal conditions the CpGs that are located in these intergenic regions and repetitive intervals <em>are</em> methylated.  This methylated state maintains genomic stability.  However in cancer these CpGs are hypomethylated. This results in an opening of chromatin and a decrease of genomic stability.  This disruption of the normal DNA methylation pattern contributes to disease by producing increased illegitimate recombination of repeats, increased translocations of repeats (leading to deletions and insertions), and activating previously silent promoters (leading to transcriptional starts of oncogenes).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of drugs known as DNA demethylating agents.  These drugs usually inhibit the main enzyme that methylates DNA, <strong>D</strong>NA <strong>N</strong>-<strong>M</strong>ethy <strong>T</strong>ransferase, and so are also called DNMT inhibitors.  By inhibiting DNMT, Decitabine causes a decrease in DNA methylation.  DNA methylation is associated with silencing gene expression, and if this occurs for tumor suppressor genes, cancer can result.  Decitabine, by decreasing DNA methylation, turns on gene expression, and if tumor suppressor genes are affected this provides the beneficial effect in cancer treatment.  Tumor suppressor genes have less methylation due to Decitabine, allowing them to be expressed and to suppress the cancer phenotype.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in methylation (both hyper and hypo) at imprint control regions (ICR) can lead to loss of imprinting, either both parental alleles are expressed or neither are.  This is a common and early event in many cancers, as many imprinted genes are involved in growth.  The H19/IGF2 cluster is an example of hypermethylation of the ICR.  The paternal ICR is normally methylated, keeping insulator protein CTCF from binding, allowing enhancers to act to express IGF2 and keep H19 silenced.  The maternal ICR is normally unmethylated, allowing CTCF protein to bind and leading to expression of H19 and silencing of IGF2.  During hypermethylation, both the paternal and maternal ICR becomes methylated leading to expression of IFG2 from both parental alleles.  This disruption of H19/IGF2 imprinting occurs in Wilm’s tumor.  Since IGF2 is involved in promoting growth, this double IGF2 dose tips the balance toward increased growth, and this is the mechanism responsible for the phenotype in Wilm’s tumor. </p></div>
