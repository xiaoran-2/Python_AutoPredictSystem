    <div class="field-value"><p class="ecxmsonormal">The CpG dinucleotide are sensitive sites for methylation in the 5 carbone, and DNA methylation is mitoticaly heritable wich is importante in the growth of the number of cancer cells. In normal cells, we can found unmethylated CpG islands because this region is usually expressed. However, when an aberration is present in the CpG Island we can see a hypermethylation, which produce a silencing of tumor suppressor genes. The CpG islands hypermethylated are called call CIMP and when they act over a certain kind of genes, cancer may be developed. These particular genes wich distinguish the cancerous cells from the normal cells are called biomarkers and are really important to diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of the disease. Some examples of cancer biomarkers are RB, MLH1, BRCA1, MGMT, etc…wich have a different implications indifferent types of cancer. We might to note the CpG island shores are extend around 2Kb up-stream and down-stream producing silencing of that entire zone.</p>
<p class="ecxmsonormal">In the case of normal cells we found the intergenic regions and repetitive sequences have high methylated level, silencing a specific part of the genome. However, cancer cells show a demethylation in these regions, inducing the loss of integrity and structure of the genome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the general case when we have cancerous cells is present a hypermethylation or hipomethilation of different regions of the genome depending with the context, this caused the loss of imprinting. This occurs in the early development of the cancerous cells. To illustrate what happened in the imprinting regions in cancer development we talk about H19/Igf2 cluster. In normal tissues this cluster presents an unmethylated ICR maternal allele causing CTCF binds with ICR and the enhancers work with H19, in other hand the paternal allele ICR is methylated causing the enhancers work over Igf2. However, the cancer cells of Wilm’s tumor show a methylated ICR maternal allele, causing a uniparental disomy, increase of Igf2 expression and H19 underexpression. This affects an important cellular development cluster.</p>
<p>The imprinting regions are susceptible to cause cancer because they are involved in growth and development, in Wilm’s tumor we found an excellent example of how these epigenetic changes can affect and produce the disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylated agent like azacitidine. It is a member of an epigenetic drug class that grows every day; this drug shows a slower cellular cancer proliferation. This phenomenon occurs because cancer cells present high methylation in functional genes, and when low dosage of DNA demethylases are added, the silencing of important genes is reduced. This treatment has shown really good results, showing that the most promising drugs are the epigenetic-based ones.</p>
<p>This drug is used to treat myelodisoplastic syndroms precursors of leucemia myeloide. Also, studies have been done to combine DNA demethylases like Deciptabine and Azacitidie with deacethylases, showing a significant reduction in cancer, leukemia and lymphoma development. They affect the cell, making it more sensitive to chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The changes made by the DNA demethylases are inherited while cell division is happening. They go from the mother to the daughter until the inactivation period is achieved, because there they are fully erased. This represents a specific treatment for cancer cells that will not affect healthy cells. But this only happen if we use low dosage, because in the epigenome, there are parts that should be totally silenced, like heterochromatin, intergenic regions and the repeated sequences. If they are demethylated with DNA demethylases drugs, the genome stability and integrity could be affected.</p>
<p>To administrate accurately the DNA demethylases drugs, we should notice about the sensitive periods in the early development and primordial germ cells development. In these periods occurs a cell reprogrammation that may loses the DNA methylation. If drugs that affect methylationin that periods are administrated, it can cause that intergenic regions, repeated sequences or heterochromatin do not be restored appropriately, causing genome instability and this could be seriously problematic even for subsequent generations. Even a treatment of DNA demethylases with a pregnant woman may cause baby loss.</p></div>
