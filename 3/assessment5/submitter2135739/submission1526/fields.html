    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually associated with promotor regions of the gene. They tend to by hypomethylated, or not methylated, in normal cells. In cancer however, the opposite occured. These CpG islands on cancer tends to be methylated, or hypermethylated, and this results in many abnormalities. Methylation of CpG islands result in gene silencing that is connected to the promotor that CpG island belongs to, and demethylation normally results in gene expression. One of the genes that are usually methylated and repressed the Tumor-suppressor gene which, as the name suggest, suppress tumors. As a result of silencing the Tumor suppressor gene the tumor and grow without resistant. Similarly,this happened to other genes and cause many diseases.  disruption of DNA methylation may causes the genes to either express or become repressed at times that it is not suppose to, and that disrupts the cell function and ultimately the body. For example, the a gene coding for a protein gets methylated and silenced, the cell is unable to trascribe and translate into that protein which may plays an essential role for the body.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated in normal cells in order to maintain genomic stability. In cancer, again, the reversed happened. They tend to not be methylated, and this consequently leads to genomic instability and mulations. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells because they cause mutation or transcription interferance. Disruption or failure to do so will cause mutation and disease because of genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent that causes DNA demethylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. This prevent the genomer from hypemethylation, which is one of cancer's characteristics. In cancer cells, CpG islands are methylated in an abnormal amount, which causes silencing of  many genes, especially the tumor suppressor gene. And so, by inhibitin DNA methyltransferase it prevent hypermethylation of the tumor suppressors gene which might allow the cell to prevent its cancer state.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The sensitive period is the period most suseptable to epigenetic changes, usually at reprogramming stages. Alteration of DNA methylation results in altered expression pattern. At sensitive periods the genome is easier to manipulate,affected by enviromental factors, and lasting. Treating patients in this stage should not be done because the genetic materials are sensitive to change and may cause undesirable effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of the paternal genome occurs considerably sooner than the maternal genome during development. Igf2 gene is said to be maternally imprinted, which means it will only be expressed by the paternal genome. H19 contain the imprint control region which controls the expression of Igf2 which in turn control growth and development. Disruption of methylation in those region may result in abnormal growth and potentially, tumors</p></div>
