    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the main regulations at the epigenetic level is the DNA  methylation in CpG islands. The evidence suggests that this is associated to gene expression regulation, mainly through transcriptional silencing. This mechanism may be understood on the basis that methyl groups modulate accessibility to chromatin transcription factor binding sites. The reduced representation bisulfite sequencing  (RRBS) has been used to quantitatively profile DNA methylation. This technique showed that some aberrant methylation in cancer cell lines can occur in CpG that are linked to genomic imprinting. These aberrations may cause an altered stability of heterochromatin which can lead to an excessive exposure of transcription factor binding sites that should be otherwise more restricted. Also, a defective methylation in CpG is not only involved in tumorigenesis but also in the development of other diseases. This could be mediated by inhibition of DNA methyltransferases by xenobiotics, for example, resulting in re-expresion of   silenced genes. There are some studies showing that healthy volunteers exhibited reversion of CpG island hypermethylation after treatment with antiarrhythmic drug procainamide.</p>
<p>Furthermore, hypermethylation in intergenic or repeat regions seems to have a role in the stability of the genome-wide. In fact, a disruption like hypomethylation has been demonstrated to cause genome instability if it takes place in those regions. Indeed, some observations suggest that loss of DNA methylation from intergenic or repeat regions may modify transcription rates helping to the tumor formation and progression using several other signaling pathways, like some troubles with transcription in cis. In general, changes in the methylation patterns either in intergenic, repeats or CpG islands, may lead to chromosome instability, interfering with transcriptional process and contributing to pathogenesis of disease. An example of the disrupted methylation in a repetitive element (SAT2CHRM1) showed that poor sperm quality was associated with hypermethylation of that element.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Insulin-like growth factor II (Igf2), a mitogen implicated in growth, cell proliferation, is imprinted in a paternal way. Interestingly H19 gene, located about 130 kb downstream of Igf2 encodes a highly expressed growth regulator, non coding RNA that shares regulatory elements with Igf2 and is maternally imprinted. The expression of these two genes is controlled by specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs). One DMR is located 5’ of the H19 promoter and methylated on the paternal chromosom and has a role of control of the imprinted region (IC1) acting as an insulator. Deletion of the maternal IC1 results in activation of the maternal Igf2, which in normal conditions is silent, and in down-regulation of H19. Wilm’s tumour is a type of cancer in kidneys that occurs in children.The evidence suggests that a possible cause for this tumour is a biallelic expression (loss of heterozygosity) of Igf2 associated with loss of methylation at a DMR controlling this gene. Overall, studies in mice have demonstrated that a defective or altered imprinting of H19 and Igf2 can be associated with placental and fetal abnormalities. Indeed, modified epigenetic regulation of the H19-Igf2 region in human placenta could be associated with pregnancy complications as preeclampsia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an aza-nucleosides, inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases, hence hypomethylates DNA. Its actions include removal of inhibitory methyl groups from cytosines located in promoter sequences, which most likely restores downstream gene transcription. Some observations suggest that aza-nucleosides target epigenetic mechanisms associated with malignancies that are linked to energy metabolism. It has been demonstrataed that decitabine can only be integrated into DNA strands, while others like azacitidine is incorporated either in DNA or RNA. These epigenetics inhibitors are able to reactivate the expression of death receptor Fas in tumour cells and can target the Fas-mediated apoptosis-signaling pathways to increase apoptosis in tumour cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes due to epigenetic modifications are passed on during cell division to daughter cells. A sensitive period is defined as the moment when the epigenetic reprogramming is taking effect.</p>
<p>The first sensitive period is during the development of germ cell and the other one is during early development. Subjects that are treated in those periods can suffer disruptions of the final stage of epigenetic reprogramming. For example in in vitro fertilization the females are in a super ovulation state, which induces to release many eggs that could be immature. In this moment a disruption of epigenetic reprogramming can happen. Also, the role of environmental components in disease either in the transient early-life exposures in individual or the potential involvements of the germline are factors to be considered in the onset of disease in adults.</p></div>
