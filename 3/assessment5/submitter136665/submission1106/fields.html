    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In healthy cells CpG sites in CpG islands tend to be unmethylated regardless of the expression state of their associated genes (Takai, et al, 2002). However, in cancer cells the islands in genes tend to be hypermethylated  (over methylated) resulting in gene inactivation (Egger, et al 2004). This can result in cancer through inactivating tumor suppressor genes that are normally active in healthy cells (Egger, et al, 2004).  In contrast, CpG sites located in intergenic and repeat regions tend to be methylated in healthy cells but hypomethylated (under methylated) in cancer cells (Hodges, et al 2011). This lack of methylation leads to activation of transcription in retroviral insertions and satellite repeats, which can lead to transpositions than can cause genomic instability in addition to transcriptional noise (Hodges. et al, 2011).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The gene H19 encodes a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that is known to silence the expression of Insulin Growth Factor 2 (igf2) (Kim and Lee, 1997). Normally H19 is methylated (and therefore not expressed) in the paternal allele, resulting in expression of igf2 (Gao, et al, 2002). However, in the maternal allele this not the case, as H19 is unmethylated resulting in igf2 not being expressed. In the case of patients with Wilm's tumor, both the maternal and paternal alleles of H19 are methylated, leading to an overexpression of igf2 (Steenman, et al, 1994). The overexpression of this growth factor igf2 can lead to kidney tumors (as in Wilm's patients) and to giantism (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome; <span>Leighton, et al, 1995</span>).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a demethylating agent; it works by binding to methyltransferase enzymes preventing them from methylating DNA. This results in genes that were silenced by methylation to be expressed again. This can have a anti-tumor affect if a previously silenced regulator of an oncogene is thereby allowed to be expressed, theerby silencing the expression of the oncogene. The example given in the Economist article was the regulator gene BRD4, which when expressed, silences the oncogene Myc.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has been shown (at least in some cases), to be mitotically inherited. This means that altering the expression through methylation/demethylation not only affects the cell but other cells descended from it. This is particularly a concern during "sensitive periods" in development where cells are differentiating and are undergoing large scale demethylation and methylation. These periods include the period just after fertiization of the egg (and subsequent formation of the zygote), and later as the fetus is developing gonads and gamates. It would be inadvisible to treat either the fetus or the mother with epigenetic drugs during these times as they could result in unwanted disruptions of the development process and lead to birth defects.</p></div>
