    <div class="field-value"><p>Studies over the last decade have shown that epigenitic alterations including histone markings, chromatin structure regulation and DNA methylation are inherent in cancer. DNA methylation may play a significant role in all three types of alterations.  In most of the genome including intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation is inversely responsible for gene regulation, allowing a gene to either be expressed or not, such as in genomic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation and regulation of histones.  Unlike most of the geneome however, methylation of CpG islands appears to be independent of their level of expression and are usually kept methylation free. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cancer studies have identified hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands.  Hypermethylation at these areas results in impairment, via silencing of genes that control cell cycles such as growth, DNA repair and apoptosis.  As methylation state is stable, these disruptions are passed to the daughter cells during normal cell division.  With this disregulation in gene expression both healthy and damaged cells can continue to multiply without restriction causing tissue, organ, and organism level dysfunction.  Additionally, cancer specific differentially methylated regions, cDMRs, may impact the 3D chromatin architecture via hypermethylation resulting in changes to the chromatin boundries.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>In contrast to the regional hypermethylation at CpG islands, DNA genome wide hypomethylation occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells causing variable expression, such as the loss of expression control provided by parental imprinting, over expression of repeats, and systemic instability.  Increased expression of ncRNA could result in changes in histone markings resulting in additional system instabilitiy.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is a process that silences an allele based on the parent of orgin.  Imprinting is acheived through DNA methylation and histone modulation.  These epigenitic marks are established in the primordial germ cells are are maintained throughout the life of the organsim.  Examples of imprinted genes include H19/Igf2 cluster.  The paternal Igf2 insulator gene is methalated inhibiting the gene repressor CTCF from binding to the insulator. In it's absense, an enhancer is now free to turn on the father's IGF2 promotor.  Since the mother's insulator has not been methylated, CTCF does bind to it resulting in maternal gene silencing.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> H19 is responsible for coding a long ncRNA in humans that is believed to be responsible for regulating expression of IGF2.  H19 is normally only transcribed from the maternal allele.  However, mutations in the imprinted methylation pattern, as in Wilms tumor, can cause several systemic defects.  Overexpression of IGF2 can result from full methylation of both the maternal and paternal H19. As H19 promoter methylation reaches 100% expression of IGF2 increases. This mutation can be responsible for organism overgrowth and tends to be lethal.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a epigenetic inhibitor hypomethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.   Decitabine inhibits the function of DNA methyltransferase.  As discussed in previous questions in this assignemnt, hypermethylation at CpG islands causes silencing of tumor suppressor and other cell regulatory genes.  Restoring proper levels of methylation through methylation erasure can restore cellular functions.  As the cells continue to divide normally the cells impaced by decitabine will pass the erased methylation state to daughter cells. With cellular functions such as aptoposis restored the tumor would fail to grow and possibily shrink.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation state has been shown to be stable and heritable.  This means that as cells divide and differentiate from embryonic stem cells into specific tissues, the level and location of methylation remains constant.  Daughter cells retain the methylation state of the parent cell.  This ensures that cells of one type do not revert to stem cell state or another tissue type.  This charateristic provides hope that treatment with pharmacuticals such as Decitabine that alter methlyation state without damaging the cell will be a permenent treatment for cancer.  However, there are unknown and know risks of applying stable methylation altering treatments to live organisims. </p>
<p>For example, sensitive developmental periods where the cell is naturally is changing the methylation state of the genome.  Examples of sensitive periods include during primary germ cell creation, during zygote formation and during rapid periods of growth. Treatment during these periods could cause inaccurate or incomplete methylation.  Interference with the demethylation/methylation during sensitive preriods has a high likelyhood of creating methylation errors that could result impairment (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrom) or death of the organism.  </p></div>
