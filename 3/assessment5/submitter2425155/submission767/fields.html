    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation does not occur often at CpG islands but at CpG sites. The main function of DNA methylation is to repress gene expression and maintain genomic stability. In cancer tissues, hypomethylation is present so transcription and transaltion can easily occur. This region is now open to environemental factors such as carcingogens where as non demethlyated parts are not at all affected because the genes are silenced. Intergenic regions consist of genes that are harmful to the cell such as IAP's. DNA methyaltion of these regions prevents the transcritpion and transaltion of these harmful genes so the cells can survive. Similalrly, DNA methylation occurs in repetitive elements to preent the  expression of transposons. In cancer, dna methylation is removed causing the expression of the genes which lead to uncontrolled profileration cells. Once the methylationn marks are removed, transcription factors are eaily able to attach to  the sites. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylation agent, so it as methyl inhibitor agent. As a demethylation agent, Decitabine acts by removing the DNA methly marks through DNA demethyltransferase. As a result, the gene becomes open to transcriptional factors producing more protien. In the case of Decitabine, hypomethylation takes place causing the epression of gene which in turn has an anti-tumor effect through activating tumor supressor genes such as p53. The activation, transcription, and translation of the tumor supressor genes causes an anti-tumor effect which reduces the tumors. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can permanently remain because it mitotically heritable. Once epigenetic factors are introduced they can be inherited during embryonic development. During gamete development all epigenetic factors are removed so the genes are completely viable to change. A sensistive period is when all epigenetic factors are removed. In this stage, any gene is open to transcription but can be altered very easily leading to mutations and possibly cancer. Sensitive periods of development occur dring pre-embryonic developement and the second stage of embryonic development. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would cause genetic damage leadig to cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is the process of laying epigenetic marks during the development of a fetus. If this impriinting is disrupted then improper methylation and acetylation makrs are layed which can lead to the expression of the wrong genes. For example, a methylation mark  could be layed on anti-tumor supressor gene resulting in the overexpression of a cancer gene. The methylation of the maternal allele deteremines Igf2 expression. If there is hypermethylation then the Igf2 expression is reduced. If hypomethylation of Igf2 occurs then there will be significant expression which leads to cancer. The H19 and Ifg2 cluster are associated for gene expression. The supression of the H19 gene leads to the expression of Igf2 viceversa. In Wilm's tumor, methyl marks are removed which causes the genes to be translated. The disruption of the cluster leads to overexpression of the genes which causes an accelerated profileration of cells. </p></div>
