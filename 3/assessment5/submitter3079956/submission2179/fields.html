    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Abnormal methylation of DNA can be a hallmark of cancer. Normally, CpG islands, which are enriched in promoter regions, are unmethylated at nearby “shores’ if the gene is expressed. In cancer, this pattern is disrupted. CpG islands become hypermethylated and if this occurs in a tumor-suppressor gene, abnormal cell division can follow.</p>
<p>CpG methylated islands can recognized by binding proteins that cause the DNA to be inaccessible to transcription machinery by condensing the chromatin structure and blocking transcription factors from binding.</p>
<p>Inappropriate methylation can also cause other diseases by silencing critical genes. An example would be a disease caused by improper imprinting during development.</p>
<p>Methylation also occurs at intergenic regions and at repetitive elements. Methylation at these regions can maintain genomic integrity by preventing transposition, transcription from nearby strong promoters, and inappropriate recombination. Disruption of these patterns can lead to cancer by causing inappropriate cell division. This can be caused by silencing gene expression by altering the chromatin structure. If a tumor suppressor gene becomes silenced because the chromatin structure is altered or because it is disrupted by a transposition, cancer may ensue. These mechanisms can also explain non-cancer diseases—the altered gene expression patterns do not necessarily have to be involved with regulation of cell division.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA imprinting is mechanism where genes are expressed or silenced depending on the parent-of-origin of the alleles.</p>
<p>In the example of H19/Igf2 cluster, normally H19 is expressed only from the maternal allele and Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. The mechanism is that on the maternal allele, the insulating protein CTCF blocks methylation of an ICR between H19 and Igf2; this causes interaction with enhancers with the H19 promoter and the enhancers do not interact with Igf2.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, the ICR site is methylated and CTCF does not bind and this methylation spreads to the H19 promoter and causes silencing. The enhancers on the paternal chromosome now bypass the block H19 locus and interact with the Igf2 promoter and cause expression of IGF2.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor Igf2 is overexpressed in the cancer and this may be caused by loss of imprinting of Igf2 from the maternal allele. There is also a lncRNA--AIR--which is anti-sense to Igf2 and can regulate expression of Igf2. </p>
<p>Loss of imprinting of IGF2 is a commonly seen in the childhood cancer Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. The mechanism is the overexpression of Igf2, and  Cdktn1c loss.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a molecule that inhibits DNA methylation by DNA methyltransferases, such as EZH2, and so is considered a hypomethylation or de-methylation agent.  Decitabine is a cytidine nucleoside that is incorporated into newly synthesized DNA and covalently binds DNMTs, sequestering them and leading to hypomethylation. This can have anti-tumor effects because tumor suppressor genes are commonly inactivated by methylation and the drug can prevent this from happening. It works as a treatment in some cancers by blocking inactivation of tumor suppressors caused by DNA methylation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have effects that can be long lasting because the alterations are covalent modifications to DNA and they are passed on to daughter cells when the DNA is replicated. Sensitive periods are time periods when epigenetic programming (i.e., modifications) is taking place, such as during pre-implantation fetal development and gametogenesis. This epigenetic programming is passed on to daughter cells and is tightly regulated. Treatments that occur during this programming will cause inappropriate modifications and disrupt appropriate modifications, and due to the inheritable characteristics of these modifications, the disruptions will have long lasting effects, mostly effects that are not desired.</p>
