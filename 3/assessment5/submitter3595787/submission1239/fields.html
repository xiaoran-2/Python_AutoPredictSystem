    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation almost excusively occurs at CpG dinucleotides in mammals. CpG's are clustered into CpG islands, often at the promoters of genes. Promoters are at the start of genes and are where transcription machinery binds. CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation, but when methylation occurs, silencing of gene expression happens. However, during cancer, t<span>umor suppressor genes are often silenced in cancer cells due to hypermethylation. In contrast, the genomes of cancer cells have been shown to be hypomethylated overall when compared to normal cells, with the exception of hypermethylation events at genes involved in cell cycle regulation, tumor cell invasion, </span><span class="ontologyTermLink">DNA repair</span><span>, and others events in which silencing propagates </span><span class="glossaryTermLink">metastasis. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated. DNA methylation helps maintain genomic integrity at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. At the intergenic regions, the Dnmt1 null cells display genomic instability, and help silence the cryptic transcription start sites or splice sites. At the repetitive elements, silencing of repeats occurs to prevent transposition. Transposition results in the duplication of a transposable element, which is a DNA sequence that can change its position within the genome, sometimes creating mutations. In addition, DNA methylation helps silence the repeats to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and methylation of the repeats helps prevent illegitimate recombination. During cancer, hypomethylation occurs at the intergenic regions/repeats. Illegitimate recombination between the repeats begins occurring, activation of repeats and transposition occurs, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes begins occurring. In cancer, there is high promethylation of the repetitive or intergenic regions. They align, misalign, and then illegimate recombination occurs because they're not densely packaged down into heterochromes. The repeats are activated because of hypomethylation, therefore the repeats can make more copies of themselves and jump around genome and transpose. This may disrupt the coding region of the gene or activate neighboring genes. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region is unmethylated in the maternal allele and methylated in the paternal allele, indicating that the DNA methylation imprint is on the paternal chromosome. When the ICR is unmethylated in the maternal allele, it is bound by the protein CTCF, an insulator protein. Hence, CTCF binding insulates Igf2 in the maternal allele from the downstream enhancers. Because it is insulating Igf2, the enhancers are free to act on H19, a long noncoding RNA, and enhance H19's expression on the maternal allele. On the paternal allele, where the ICR is methylated, CTCF can no longer bind. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence, and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate. Therefore Igf2 is only expressed from the paternal allele. However in cancer, with loss of imprinting, you have hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal and paternal allele, and expression of Igf2 on both alleles, resulting in a double dose of Igf2. Therefore, alteration in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo/hypermethylation) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes. Because these events occur early, often pre-neoplastic tissue, this results in the early action of tumorigenesis, before detectable. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. Decitabine is part of a class of "demethylating" agents. Methylation of DNA is a major mechanism that regulates gene expression in cells.  When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in the blockage of the activity of suppressor genes that regulate cell division and growth. When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer.<span><span> </span></span></span>Decitabine works by demethylation/interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites. Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Aberrant DNA methylation patterns - hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue - have been associated with a large number of human malignancies. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms. A sensitive period is a<span> period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals, eg. in vitro culture. </span></span>Sensitive periods of development are during embryogenesis and gametogenesis, when epigenetic marks are established rather than maintained. Sensitive periods are predominantly during establishment of epigenetic marks, rather than maintenance. Epigenetic marks may be transmitted transgenerationally, so any environmental effects may have multi-generational effects. Hence, treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because if the treatment goes incorrectly, marks in the form of epigenetic marks can form on an individual's genes. <span>Although these epigenetic marks do not cause mutations in the DNA itself, the chemical modifications - including DNA methylation - change gene expression by silencing or activating genes. This can alter fundamental biological processes and adversely affect health outcomes throughout life.</span></p></div>
