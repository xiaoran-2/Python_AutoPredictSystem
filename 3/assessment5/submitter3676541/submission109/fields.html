    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 imprint control region, there is methylation of the CTCF binding site. This methylation prevents the binding of the insulating factor CTCF, the methylation spreads into the H19 promoter, and the downstream enhancers activate expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, a lack of methylation at the CTCF binding site enables CTCF to bind to the locus. In this position, CTCF now blocks the effects of downstream enhancers on the Igf2 gene. This results in a decreased expression of Igf2, and a corresponding increase in H19 expression.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm’s tumour, hyper-methylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster in the maternal allele prevents CTCF binding to the locus. This allows for expression of the maternal copy Igf2 in addition to the already expressed paternal copy. Since Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene, any cells with increased expression will have a competitive advantage over their neighbours and will likely contribute to pre-neoplastic tissue.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation generally functions to silence gene expression. In most cases, a ‘normal’ genome would consist of heavily methylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements, with little methylation of CpG islands in promoter sequences. As tumorigenesis proceeds, we see a reversal of this trend, in which the CpG islands of promoters become increasingly hyper-methylated whilst intergenic sequences and repetitive elements become increasingly hypo-methylated.</p>
<p>The normal, hypo-methylated state of CpG islands at promoter sequences allows for proper transcription of the associated genes. As differentiation proceeds, genes targeted for silencing in a particular lineage will naturally see their promoters become increasingly methylated. Improper DNA methylation in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes (such as RB, MLH1, BRCA1, etc.) can result in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, there are predictable sets of genes that appear to be consistently hypermethylated in certain gliomas, neuroblastomas, and colorectal cancers.</p>
<p>Conversely, the normal, hyper-methylated state of intergenic regions and repetitive elements allows for the silencing of typically non-coding DNA sequences. If these regions lose this silencing as a result of DNA hypo-methylation, they could cause increasing instability in the genome through illegitimate recombination of repeats, disruptive transposition/translocation events, and the unwanted activation of cryptic promoters to disrupt regular gene expression. Activation of cryptic promoters and hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can cause the silencing of tumour suppressors and activation of proto-oncogenes, respectively. On the other hand, the hypomethylation of repetitive regions and transposable elements, confers an overall loss of genomic integrity, increasing the probability of hits in the genome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a demethylating agent. It is a nucleoside analog that irreversibly binds to –and hence inhibits - DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Since DNMTs are required for methyl groups to be added to DNA, this inhibition will result in a body-wide hypo-methylation, but only in cells that are actively dividing. Consequently, tumour cells will be preferentially targeted, since they will be dividing more than any other cells in the body.</p>
<p>Currently, Decitabine is being used to treat Myelodysplastic Syndrome, a hematological condition that can progress into acute myelogenous leukemia, although research is still ongoing regarding its use in solid tumours. It is known that Myesdysplastic Syndrome progression is dependent on heavy CpG island hypermethylation, and that heavy CpG island methylation results in a poor prognostic outcome for patients.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation patterns are mitotically heritable, thanks to the functionality of methylation maintenance enzymes such as DNMT1. Consequently, the changes to methylation patterns brought about by drug usage can persist long after the drug has been removed from the body.</p>
<p>A sensitive period – with respect to epigenetics – refers to points in development in which significant epigenetic reprogramming is occurring. In human development, the two primary sensitive periods occur during the pre-implantation stage of embryonic development and during primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>Because these sensitive periods are defined as developmental points at which extensive epigenetic reprogramming is taking place, any medical treatment that targets the epigenetic machinery used during these periods would be likely to drastically alter the epigenome of the individual. As we have seen, epigenetic alterations that influence the expression of only one gene (for example, Igf2) or repetitive element (for example, an IAP) can have enormous consequences on the development of an individual. Interfering with epigenetic programming during sensitive periods could potentially have effects on the entire genome.</p></div>
