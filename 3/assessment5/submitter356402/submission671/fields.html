    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, there is little or no methylation at CpG islands, while there are methylation in intergenic regions, repetitve elements or within introns of genes.</p>
<p>In contrast, the oppositie occurs in cancer cells. CpG islands are hypermethylated while introns, repititve elements and introns are hypomethylated. Normally, cytosine guanine dinucleotides are methylated to slience genes that are meant to be silenced. For example, CpG islands are methylated in inactivated X chromosomes, where gene expression from the inactivated chromosome is completely inhibited.</p>
<p>In cancer, there is hypermethylation at CpG islands, and this leads to silencing. Silencing of tumour suppressor genes is one of the ways to disrupt cell cycle regulation in cells, leading to an increased risk of cancer, as cells are not properly regulated even when there are damages or mutations in DNA. These cells do not die as frequently. This can be described as one of the "hits" to cancer cells. Silencing of tumour suppressor genes through epigenetic means is one of the many alterations made to cancer cells.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genome stability. DNA methylation would reduce chances of translocation, deletions, insertions or duplications. Repeats are methylated to prevent transposition, as well as to silence cryptic promoters which would disrupt gene expression if not properly methylated.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, these repeat elements and intergenic regions are not methylated. The harmful effects of random transposition occur, where genome instability results and normal gene expression is disrupted. Genes expressed in different directions may result in RNA polymerase interference, where RNA polymerase transcribing in different directions block each other. Random duplications and deletions may disrupt cancer-critical genes or activate oncogenes, leading to cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, methylation for the paternal allele occurs at the imprint control region, and thus CTCF cannot bind to the imprint control region. Without the CTCF, the methylation pattern is spread to the nearby H19 gene as well, and thus H19 is not expressed in the paternal allele. This means that enhancers can act on Igf2 gene which is expressed, producing Igf2. For the maternal allele however, the imprint control region is not methylated, allowing for CTCF to bind. CTCF acts as an insulator protein, which in a sense blocks the enhancer from being able to act on Igf2 gene in the maternal allele. As a result, H19 becomes expressed instead of Igf2. Only Igf2 on the paternal allele is expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, imprint control regions in both parental alleles are methylated, which means that no CTCF can bind. Thus Igf2 at both alleles are expressed, resulting in two times the expression of Igf2 compared to normal cells.</p>
<p>Igf2 is a growth promoter. With high levels of Igf2, cells divide more rapidly and there is excessive cell proliferation. These cells make up the tumour, and eventually if other genes are disrupted cancer may result.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, allowing epigenetic changes to be preserved by all the daughter cells in the same cell line. This is made possible by DNMT1, which copies epigenetic marks to the complementary DNA strands after replication by recognising CpG dinucleotide pairs that has only one cytosine methylated.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods where the cells are susceptible to epigenetic reprogramming. It is the time where imprinting is reset and DNA methylation patterns are reset. This happens during primordial germ cell development and during blastocyst formation. Such drugs should therefore not be given to young children who are still developing into adults.</p>
<p>Disrupting DNA methylation may cause drastic changes in gene expression if drug dosage is too high. Epigenetic information may not be properly reset for the next generation should the drugs interfere with primordial germ cell development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent, acting as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.</p>
<p>Decitabine prevents DNA methylation from being copied over to different daughter cells. This would mean that DNA methylation patterns will be diluted over time, allowing cells to reexpress genes that were previously silenced. In other words, the silencing effects are reversed.</p>
<p>When this demethylation over time occurs, cells are able to express silenced tumour suppressor genes again. Normal functioning of cells' regulation system is reactivated. As a result, tumour suppressor genes regain their function, and will prevent tumour formation by activating apoptosis when required or stopping cell cycle progression when there are damages in the genome.</p></div>
