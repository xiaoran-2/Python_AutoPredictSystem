    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the cytosin and adenine DNA nucleotides, it changes the expression of genes in cells as division and differentiation takes place. Altering of DNA methylation in cancer is reversible, the changes in methylation maybe similar to the effect of mutation of tumor suppressor genes. The purpose of methylation st CPG islands include the long range silencing of repetitive sequences. However methylation of CPG island is disrupted in cancer by hypermethylation of the CPG island. Hypermethylation of the CPG island in cancer represses the transcription of promoter region there by silencing the underlying gene.   </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent. It hypomethylates the DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It is used for treating myleodysplatic syndromes. Decitabine belongs to a class of histone-deacetylas inhibitor. Hypermthylation of CPG islands leads to silencing of underlying gene, henceforth the hypomethylation property of decitabine enables it to act as an anti tumour agent when administered.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>seive period is the early stages of child conception it is ther stage in which there is increased sensitivity to epigentice mechanism. There are two main sensitve periods in humans. Sensitive period influence DNA methylation pattern on genes. The human sensitive period takes place right after fertilization later in the embryonic sage  </p></div>
