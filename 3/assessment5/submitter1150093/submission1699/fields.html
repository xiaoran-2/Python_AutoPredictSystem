    <h1>Submission 1699 from Anon (session_user_id: 593019b0260632d2ac74c4e1903e4c2b65bfb70e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors that target enzymes that lay epigenetic marks. Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase, which is responsible for methylation of the non-methylated strand of DNA during DNA replication and thus keeps the DNA methylation pattern. As a consequence of the function of DNMT, decitabine inhibits the mantainance of DNA methylation.</p>
<p>DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands causes gene silencing. If hypermethylation happens at the CpG island of a tumour supressor gene, then this help a cancer to arise. Consequently, the drug has an anti-tumour effect for those tumours affected by DNA hypermethylation that causes the silencing of a tumour supressor gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer both as hypomethylation and hypermethylation.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is often associated with gene silencing. That is, methylation at CpG islands that are the promoter of a gene cause the gene not to be expressed. It has been observed in cancers that both hypermethylation or hypomethylation of CpG islands can be altered. Cancer can be influenced by hypermethylation of a CpG island neighbouring a tumour supressor gene. Alternatively, hypomethylation at CpG can trigger them to be poor promoters and allow expression of the gene. If the gene is an oncogene, this contributes to cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements of DNA are usually methylated, probably to mantain genomic integrity and to protect the genome from transposable elements. <span>DNA hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is associated with genomic instability, e.g, illegitimate recombination between repeats can occur, activation of repeats and disruption.. All these events contribute to the disruption of normal gene activity and this might lead to an aberrant growth of the cell by altering the normal function of several genes (tumour supressor and oncogenes). Hypomethylation of the whole genome is observed in all cancers.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because the DNA methylation pattern is mantained during DNA replication and hence the marks are mantained after cell division. As a consequence, the effect a drug could have on DNA methylation lasts beyond the duration of the treatment.</p>
<p>Because the drug affect the whole body equally, there can be periods in which it is not desirable to take such a drug. Namely, there are periods in which the environment can have an effect in epigenetic control, and these are called sensitive periods. In general, these are periods when epigenetic marks are layed down. The two major periods are 1) primordial germ cell development all the way to the production of mature gametes (eggs and sperm); 2) pre-implantation and post-implantation period. There are also minor sensitive periods in the development of specific organs. </p>
<p>A drug taken during one of these periods might have dramatical consequences for the individual in that a very wrong pattern of DNA methylation might be fixed in their organism and hence alter their normal function.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Gene imprinting refers to the methylation of a specific copy of a gene, which is determined by parent of origin.</p>
<p>For the H19/Igf2 cluster, DNA methylation occurs at the ICR of the paternal allele. Methylation of the ICR blocks the binding site of a protein called CTCF and this is turn causes enhancers downstream from ICR to promote Igf2 expression (by further methylation of the H19 promoter). Therefore, methylation at ICR causes Igf2 to be expressed. This happens in the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In the maternal alelle (no methylation at ICR) CTCF freely binds to DNA at ICR and this insulates the enhancers from Igf2. As a consequence, Igf2 expression is silenced.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, which is associated to Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, contains disruption in the imprinting in that the maternal alelle behaves like the paternal allele, that is, methylation occurs at both alelles and Igf2 is expressed from both copies. Since Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, and hence an oncogene, overexpression of Igf2 is associated with cancer.</p></div>
