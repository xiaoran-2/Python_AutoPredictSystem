    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, DNA methylation occurs in repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns, but not in CpG islands.The converse occurs in a cancer cell. By the hypermethylation of CpG islands, tumour suprressor genes are silenced in cancer and this is mitotically heritable, This cell is able to divide more rapidly starting cancer. In some cases, the hypermethilation of sets of genes is what causes the different types of cancer. Also, in case of cancer, the 2Kb forward and rewind of CpG islands are also hypermethylated.</p>
<p>Normally, the methilation of repeats and intergenic regions ables the genomic stability, making shure that we have "no problems" in our karyotype. When this regions are hypomethylated we have a genomic instability, causing problems such as illegitimate recombination between repeats, and activation of repeats and transposons.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the maternal allele, the ICR is hypomethylated, and CTCF binds to it and the activity of the enhancers activate the expression of H19, but Igf2 is silenced.</p>
<p>On the patternal allele, the ICR is hypermethylated, the enhancers able the expression of Igf2 but not H19.</p>
<p>When there is hypermethylation od ICR on the maternal allele, there is expression of Igf2 from both alleles (double dose). Since Igf2 is a growth promotor, this event is associated with Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. Is a nucleoside analogue that binds to DNMTs after being incorporated in DNA (are dependent of replication). Since cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells, they will be more affected by the inhibitor. Al lower doses, they have an anti-neoplastic effect because they are causing DNA demethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, and so it can habe enduring effects on the epigenome. A sensitive period is when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control, and in mammals they are present in times such as gametes, fertilised egg, blastocyts, epiblast and PGCs. Treating a patient during a sensitive period would deregutale the normal pattern of DNA methylation of imprinted genes, repeats, and maternal or patternal genomes in very imporant periods. As a consequence, the normal DNA methylation on PGCs and gametes would be altered and could cause problems in the descendents.</p></div>
