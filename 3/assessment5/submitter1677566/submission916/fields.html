    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal cell, CpG islands have generally low levels of methylation regardless of the transcription status of their adjacent genes (active or inactive). In cancer, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated compared to their normal state. This happens frequently in the CpG islands located in promotors of tumor suppressor genes; increased methylation in these regions leads to a decrease in transcription of these genes and less regulation on the cell cycle.  Lack of circulating tumor suppressor proteins can result in tumor formation.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in the normal human genome. Methylation at these sites maintains DNA integrity by preventing recombinations between chromosomes and forestalling a variety of possible transcriptional aberrations.  In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated, and loss of methylation results in the negative effects described above. An example of genomic instability resulting from DNA hypomethylation contributing to disease would be ICF syndrome in humans; mutation of DNMT3B leads to hypomethylation and increased expression of pericentromeric repeats. Many human cancers are also driven by genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 ICR is controlled by an enhancer-blocking mechanism. In normal imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the maternal allele’s ICR is unmethylated, leading to expression of the H19 protein and binding of CTCF which prevents expression of Igf2.  In the normal paternal allele, methylation at the ICR prevents H19 transcription and binding of the CTCF insulator; this allows the downstream enhancers to promote production of Igf2. In Wilm’s tumor, both the paternal and maternal alleles have methylation at the ICR, so therefore both alleles follow the expression pattern seen with the paternal allele; this aberrant methylation pattern leads to an increase in Igf2 expression and a decrease in H19 expression. As Igf2 is an oncogene and promotes cell growth, an increase in its expression leads to a kidney tumor common in children with Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a DNMTi-type drug approved by the FDA for treatment of certain cancers, encourages DNA demethylation. This class of drug promotes an anti-tumor effect through its action as a nucleoside analog; once it is incorporated into the DNA of an actively dividing cell, it binds DNMT irreversibly and prevents methylation as cell division continues.  This mechanism of action is particularly efﬁcient in tumor cells as they tend to divide more rapidly than other normal cells in the body.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is heritable through cell divisions due to the activity of a variety of DNA methyltransferase enzymes, so altering a cell’s methylation state would impact the epigenome of any cellular progeny it produces.  Epigenetic marks are systematically removed then selectively reestablished in sensitive periods of development, notably early embryonic development and germ cell development.  Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because of the risk of impacting methylation marks that need to be maintained or removed and reestablished during reprogramming phases.  This would particularly impact cancer patients in their puberty and childbearing years; changing the methylation status of their still-developing germ cells could lead to a detrimental impact on imprinted gene methylation status as well as somatic cell methylation status and therefore patient infertility or genetic diseases in future offspring.</p></div>
