    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normally functioning cells CpG islands are unmethylated leading to the expression or silencing of certain genes downstream of the CGIs. There is a locus specific increase of DNA methylation of CpG islands in cancer. Most often this hypermethylation is found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. There is also hypermethylation of the regions surrounding the CGIs. The hypemethylation of CGIs leads to the silencing of the tumor suppressor genes which leads to the growth of tumor cells. Over time, due to the mitotic heritability of the hypermethylation, the number of cancerous cells increases. But such hyper methylation is also a feature of normal aging. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells throughout the genome. Intergenic region methylation leads to the silencing of certain gene promoters. Methylation of repetitive elements leads to silencing and promotes the stability of the genome. In cancer cells both of these regions are hypomethylated throughout the genome. In CpG poor promoters (intergenic regions) hypomethylation can result in the expression of genes that are otherwise silent in normal cells such as the oncogenes. Hypomethylated repetitive elements lead to genomic instability in the form of deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One feature of cancer is the loss of imprinting due to the hypermethylation of imprinting control regions (ICRs). This loss of imprinting can lead to the loss of expression of growth restricting genes and/or the over expression of growth promoting genes leading to the development of cancerous tumors. Paternal allele is methylated at ICR and H19. This leads to the expression of Igf2 in normal cells. Maternal allele is unmethylated at ICR. This leads to expression of H19 which acts to silence Igf2 in normal cells. Hypermethylation of the maternal allele at IRC and H19 leads to both alleles behaving like the paternal allele. Loss of imprinting leads to over expression of growth promoting Igf2. The resulting cell growth is Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA-demethylating agents. As a DNA-demethylating agent Decitabine likely acts to demethylate areas of the genome that are hypermethylated in cancer such as CpG islands and certain imprinted genes. Decitabine’s anti-tumor effect likely arises when demethylated DNA begins to function normally by expressing tumor suppressor genes and restoring normal function to imprinted growth regulation genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations to DNA methylation are mitotically heritable meaning that the epigenetic changes made to the genome are preserved during mitosis and passed on to multiple generations of daughter cells. In the context of epigenetics a sensitive period is any period during development when epigenetic marks are being established. Sensitive periods include primordial germ cell development, namely oogenesis and spermatogenesis. The second sensitive period is pre-implantation early development in embryogenesis. Treating patients with DNA methylation altering drugs during sensitive periods could lead to the disruption of the normal establishment of epigenetic marks leading to further negative impacts to patient health and possibly future offspring of the treated patient.</p></div>
