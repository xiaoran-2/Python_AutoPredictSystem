In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I'm sorry but, when I wrote the instructions in the writing assignment I had seen this:<em> "The purpose of this assignment is to get you to synthesise information about cancer and epigenetics gleaned from the lecture videos" . </em>And I thought that they wanted a summary and I did this thing. And now, when I have gone to upload the text I have seen different instructions. I have no more time to change my work. In this sense, it's just a summary and not the answer to the questions above.<br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-7ef115225366a79b874070fa/970238/asst-5/970238-520413ad2b6ab0.98040196.pdf">Cancer epigenetics.pdf</a></p></div>
