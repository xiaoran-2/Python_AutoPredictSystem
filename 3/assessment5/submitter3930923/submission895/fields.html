    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated.  They are instead likely to be hypermethylated in cancer.  This hypermethylation occurs at the CpG islands that are in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes.  Methylation silences the gene, thereby disabling that particular tumor supressor.  The methylation is mitotically heritable, so its daughter cells will also silence tumor suppressors and divide rapidly.</p>
<p>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements of a normal cell are methylated, but tend to be hypomethylated in cancer.  The lack of methylation of repetitive elements causes an open chromatin structure, which allows for illegitimate recombinations, transposition of repetitive elements, and general genomic instability.  Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can cause activation of oncogenes or of other epigenetic machinery that then silences tumor supressors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the maternal allele the imprint control region is unmethylated.  This allows binding of CTCF, an insulator protein, which blocks the enhancers from reaching Igf2 and causes them instead to act on H19.  In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated.  This methylation prevents CTCF from binding.  Without CTCF in the way, enhancers can act on Igf2, causing it to be expressed.  Igf2 is a growth promoter, or oncogene.  Hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele (disrupted imprinting) results in twice the dose of Igf2 and causes Wilm's tumor, a childhood cancer of the kidney.  In cases such as paternal uniparental disomy or other abnormalities where the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele, not only is Igf2 overexpressed, but an important nearby tumor suppressor on the maternal allele is also absent, resulting in Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is in the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) class of chemicals.  It affects DNA methylation by becoming incorporated into DNA as a nucleoside (cytidine) analogue and irreversibly binding DNMT.  Without DNMT, daughter cells cannot be methylated.  This method of action means that affectiveness is replication dependent.  Since cancer cells replicate more rapidly than normal cells, Decitabine affects cancer cells more than normal cells.  With treatment, as each cell generation loses methylation, hypermethylation is reversed.  Some cancers feature hypermethylation at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, and when that methylation is removed the tumor suppressor gene can once again be expressed.  Decitabine is currently approved for use with myelodysplastic syndromes, which can progress to acute myeloid leukemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.  Therefore changes that are made will be inherited by every daughter cell throughout the life of the person.  At certain times during development, epigenetic marks are actively reprogrammed throughout the genome and may be sensitive to changes in the environment.  These sensitive periods occur during pre-and post-implantation of the fertilized egg, and during the development and maturation of germ cells.  If drugs that alter the epigenetic machinery are given during these stages, undesirable effects may be greater or more widespread  than if the drugs are given during times of epigenetic maintenance.  Those effects would then be mitotically inherited for the rest of the patient's life.</p></div>
