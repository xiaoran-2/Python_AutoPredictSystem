    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has effects that depend on its location. DNA methylation includes the binding of methyl groups to cytosine nucelotides, typically in a Cytosine phosphate Guanine sequence. CpG islands are regions of DNA where there are more CpG sequences than would otherwise be expected. These regions are usually promoters at the start of genes. DNA at CpG islands is normally unmethylated so genes are active. Methylation at CpG islands is associated with silencing associated genes either by directly blocking or recruiting other elements that block transcription. DNA methylation is necessary for X inactivation and parental imprinting, establishing allele specific epigenetic marks and other purposes.</p>
<p>DNA at CpG islands is usually hypermethylated in cancer. There is more methylation at CpG islands and shores in cancer than normal. This tends to silence tumor suppressor genes allowing tumors to grow faster. This is very locus specific, depending on the CpG island, the type or even sub-type of tumor and the stage of the cancer.</p>
<p>DNA CpG sequences are normally methylated at intergenic regions and repeats. This tends to prevent illegitimate recombination and transposition.  The methylation at these regions tends to prevent them from recombining improperly.</p>
<p>There is usually gemone wide loss of methylation, or hypomethylation in cancer. DNA CpG sequences are usually hypomethylated at intergenic regions, repeats and CpG poor promoters in cancer. This lack of methylation can lead to greater genomic instability and expression of oncogenes. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can lead to excess expression of microRNA that promotes tumor growth.</p>
<p>There can also be long range epigenetic silencing in which there are long ranges of nucleotides that are silenced, for example through methylation. The chromatin can also be methylated or hypoacetylated in histone tails in long areas or silenced through nuclear changes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele at the H19/Igf2 ICR is normally methylated, or imprinted. This blocks CTCF from binding to the paternal ICR. Other genomic enhancers increase expression of IGF2 in preference to H19 on this allele. The methylation also spreads to H19 further blocking its expression, called heterochromatin spreading</p>
<p>The maternal allele ICR is normally unmethylated, which allows CTCF to bind to the ICR. This CTCF insulates the enhancers from IGF2 so that is not maternally expressed. Instead, they enhance H19 expression.</p>
<p>In Wilms tumor, both alleles are hypermethylated, so they both act as paternal alleles. This can occur as a result of uni-parental disomy, two copies of the paternal chromosome. It can result from a maternal chromosome being methylated because that mark was not cleared in the mother's primordial germ cell development. It can result from aberrant de novo methylation of maternal chromosome's imprint control region </p>
<p>This leads to neither being bound to CTCF. Instead, the enhancers allow excess expression of IGF2, on both alleles, which is growth promoting and associated with Wilms tumor in the kidney in childhood.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. This agent removes methyl groups from Cytosine  (CpG). CpG islands can be hypermethylated in cancer, having more methylation than usual. Methylation in CpG tends to silence those genes. If those are tumor suppressor or growth limiting genes, then their silencing allows tumors to grow.</p>
<p>These DNA-demethylating agents can suppress or remove methylation which could remove the CpG DNA hypermethylation. Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase enzymes that add or maintain methyl groups on DNA cytosine. Decitabine can allow the growth limiting and tumor suppressor genes to be more expressed. The demethylating agents usually operate on cellular replication so when cells divide the methylation is not maintained. As cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells, the demethylating agents act more on cancer cells. The hypermethylation of CpG islands is very locus specific depending on the cancer type and stage.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because DNA methylation  can be mitotically heritable and maintained. They can alter the levels of DNA methylation at CpG islands and intergenic or repeat areas by increasing or decreasing methylation or by affecting the maintenance of methylation. For example, DNMT1 functions to establish methylation on daughter strands of DNA after replication.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of extensive epigenetic reprogramming, in which epigenetic markers are cleared and established, which include early embryonic development and primordial germ cell creation.  Treating patients in these periods could affect epigenetic marks that need to be established for their lives or in primordial germ cell development affecting offspring. Methylation of repeats is mostly maintained in both periods. Methylation of imprinted genes is maintained in early embryonic development, but cleared and reset in primordial germ cell development to set markers for parent specific imprinting of the next generation. Excessive demethylation then can result in loss of imprinting or loss of repeats methylation. Prevention of demethylation can result in not clearing the previous imprinting marks in primordial germ cell creation or or not clearing other marks in either sensitive period.</p></div>
