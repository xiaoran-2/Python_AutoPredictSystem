    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation at Cpg islands is essential for regulation and silencing of genes which is required for normal development and is associated with a number of key processes including genomic imprinting, X-Chromosome inactivation,</span><span> suppression of repetitive elements, and carcinogenesis.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele is highly methylated and this leads to predominant expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>Maternal allelic pattern is similar to the paternal allele but the expression is lesser than the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Biallelic expression of <em>IGF2</em> has been observed in association with loss of methylation at a DMR in <em>IGF2 </em>in Wilm's tumour.<strong></strong><span>This DMR, known as DMR0, has been shown to be methylated on the silent maternal </span><em>IGF2</em><span> allele presumably with a role in repression. The effect of </span><em>IGF2 </em><span>DMR0 methylation changes in the aetiology of BWS or SRS is unknown.</span></p>
<p><span>Mutations and abnormal methylations at the H19/Igf2 cluster leads to defective expression of the gene.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span> Decitabine is a histone-deacetylase inhibitor.</span></p>
<p><span>Decitabine interferes with the function of histone deacetylase. Gene expression requires coiling and uncoiling of DNA around histones by the action of histone acetylase. Histone deactylase <span>removes the acetyl groups from the lysine residues leading to the formation of a condensed and transcriptionally silenced chromatin. <span>Reversible modification of the terminal tails of core histones constitutes the major epigenetic</span><span> mechanism for remodeling higher-order chromatin structure and controlling gene expression.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Histone-deacetylase inhibitors (HDI) block this action and can result in hyperacetylation of histones, thereby affecting gene expression and <span>inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells in culture and in vivo by inducing cell cycle arrest, differentiation and/or apoptosis.</span></span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Somatic epigenetic inheritance through epigenetic modifications,</span><span> particularly through DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling, is very important in the development of multicellular eukaryotic organisms. The genome sequence is static (with some notable exceptions), but cells differentiate into many different types, which perform different functions, and respond differently to the environment and intercellular signalling. Thus, as individuals develop,morphogens</span><span> activate or silence genes in an epigenetically heritable fashion, giving cells a "memory".</span></p>
<p><span>Sensitive operiod is the time period in which DNA is most susceptible to epigenetic modifications through DNA methylation and chromatin remodling.</span></p>
<p><span>The <span>pre-implantation development and germ cell development are sensitive periods.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Treating patients during these periods may lead to unexpected and undesirable modifications in the DNA which could result in other diseases or malignancies.</span></span></p></div>
