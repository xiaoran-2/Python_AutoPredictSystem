    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation forms an important part of normal cell-regulatory processes that govern gene expression incluing emryonic development, genome imprinting, x-chromosome inactivation, preservation of chromosome stability and formation of heterochromatin. Methylation takes place at CpG shores and CpG islands thereby reguating gene activity.</p>
<p>CpG islands and shores preceding tumor suppressor genes are often hypermethylated inhibiting suppressor gene activity. Cancer cells tend to be globally hypomethylated due to disruption in DNA methyl transferase (DNMTs). In cancer the cause of the disruption to DNMTs is unknown, but appears to be linked to DNA repair systems.</p>
<p>Expaln how disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease.</p>
<p>Aberrant DNA methylation patterns-hyper and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue-have been associated with a large number of human diseases. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer/diseases through different mechanisms relating to instability.</p>
<p>The norma function of DNA mehtylation in intergenic regions is to maintain genomic stabiltiy. </p>
<p>The normal function of methylation in repetitive elements is to protect the genome from transposable elements.</p>
<p>Methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is thought to be for stabilzation of the chromosome. Hypomethylation leads to genomic instability. DNMT facilitates this process and if disrupted a destabilized chromsome can develop deletions, transpositions, and insertions that can lead to cancer. Demethylation can occur passively or actively, the latter with TET proteins and AID.</p>
<p>Transcriptioal control is a major mechanism in regulating gene expression. in addition to the promoter many other elements are involved in gene expression. Enhancer or repressor elements may reside in introns. The cis-regulatory unit can extend for long distances outside of the transcriptional unit. Some highly conserved sites have transcriptional regulatory units. Aberrant methylation patterns underlying pathologic diseases involves both hypo and hypermethylation leading to genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Parent of orgin imprinting leads to either maternal or paternal gene expression, but not both. When genes lose their imprinted methyl groups diseases including cancer may result. Imprinting can lead to hypermethylation of the H19 promoter on the paternal allele and is vital to the exression of the paternal allele of IGF2. H19 governs igf2 repression. Increased expression of H19 leads to decreased expression of IGF2 and vice versa. </span>H19 is exclusively expressed on one parental allele through imprinting and is normally only transcribed from the maternally inherited allele; paternal allele is not expressed. Methylation of the CpG site linked to the transcription factor inhibits H19 gene expression.</p>
<p class="p1">Loss of imprinting is the most common molecular abnormality in Wilms tumor. WT involves activation of the normally silent IGF2 gene, silencing of the normally active H19 gene, and aberrent methylation of the differentiall methylated region upstream of H19. CTFC has been associated with the maintenance of H19 and IGF2 imprining. In Wilms tumor biallelic expression of IGF2 has been observed with loss of methylation at a DMR in IGF2.</p>
<p class="p1">Loss of imprinting can lead to overgrowth and other pathologic changes as seen in BWS and SRS as described above.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is in a class of drugs known as demethylating agents; subclass antimetabolite, pyrimidine analog.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating drug that forms irreversible covalent adducts with DNA methyl transferase. Decitabine recovers the epression of some silenced genes by demethylating CpG islands and CpG shores restoring tumor suppression gene function and possibly control of cellular differentiation and proliferation.</p>
<p>By demethylating genes this drug can reduce proliferation, decrease abnormal cell function (such as excessive hormone production), and reduce invasion (metastasis). Demethylating drugs reverse promoter DNA hypermethylation associated with gene silencing. These effects are accompanied by sustained decrease in genomewide promoter DNA methylation, gene reexpression and antitumor regulatory pathways.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The idea is to reprogram the cancer cells; give them a new memory. By using demethylating drugs genes can be reprogramed to have an anticancer effect. Epigenetic modifications are involved in control of gene expression and their aberrant activity is thought to play a role in neoplastic transformation by causing deregulation of crucial cellular pathways. Epigenetic drugs are able to convert defective gene expression of cancer cells and reestablish normal pathways. There is a concern is that there could be long term unwanted side effects. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.  </p>
<p>It appears that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growth without having to kill all cells.  Demethylating agents probably will not be adequate for treating cancer alone because of developing resistance, but appear to prime (biosensitize) patients for better responses to standard anticancer drugs. </p>
<p>The sensitive periods are when the genome is being reprogramed especially during gametogenesis and early embryonic development and generally durng young age. Other times would be during administration of transcription factors and artificial induction of somatic cells to  ESCs.</p>
<p>It is not advisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because epigenetic therapies may interfere with the normal reprograming process and normal regulatory mechanisms leading to potential abnormalities and unintended consequences.</p></div>
