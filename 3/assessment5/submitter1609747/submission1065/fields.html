    <div class="field-value"><p>Essential developmental processes such as imprinting and X chromosome inactivation, depend on appropriate DNA methylation.  Methylated cytosine residues are associated with heterochromatin where the DNA-nucleosome complexes are tightly packed and therefore less accessible to transcription machinery (the shop is 'closed'), as opposed to euchromatin, associated with unmethylated cytosine residues, which is 'open for business, ie transcription'.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, altered patterns of DNA methylation result in aberrant cell behavior such as uncontrolled proliferation.  CpG islands, regions of DNA (often flanking the transcription start sites of genes) where CpG dinucleotides are in much higher than average concentration, are unmethylated in active genes but become methylated via the action of DNA methyltransferases in genes that are silenced.  In cancerous cells these CpG island-associated genes are often inappropriately silenced.  For example, if tumour suppressor genes become inactivated then cancer may ensue (only after several of these types of events usually).  An example of this is the hypermethylation of the promoter CpG islands of BRCA1 gene seen in human breast cancer.  BRCA1 codes for a DNA repair protein which when inactivated by methylation or mutation leads to an increased risk of cancer due to accumulating errors in the DNA code.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements, in contrast to CpG islands, tend to be methylated in normal cells and hypomethylated in cancer cells.  In normal cells methylation of these stretches of DNA functions to stabilize the chromosome structure, protecting it from illegitimate recombination events (deletions, insertions and translocations).  In mice, hypomethylation can be induced in specific tissues by selective deletion of the DNA methyltransferase 1 in their stem cells, and particular cancers result.</p>
<p>Understanding how alteration of a cell's state of DNA methylation can lead to disease is critical to the development of effective diagnoses, prognoses and treatments of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are expressed from only one of the two alleles in the genome.  Methylation at imprint control regions (ICRs) determines which allele is expressed.  Disruption of imprinting is an insult to the epigenetic machinery that can lead to cancer.  </p>
<p>In the H19/IGF2 cluster of normal cells, only the paternal allele is methylated at the imprint control region (ICR) of H19, a long non coding RNA, and the H19 locus itself. This allows the enhancer loci downstream to access the IGF2 gene via a chromatin loop and IGF2 is then expressed.  On the maternally-derived strand, the ICR and H19 are unmethylated and this permits the insulator protein CTCF to associate with the ICR and block the chromatin loop formation, preventing IGF2 transcription.  The enhancer loci act upon H19 which is then transcribed.  IGF2 is not.  </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, a nephroblastoma that affects young children, methylation is laid down on the maternal allele, allowing for the expression of IGF2.  This means that cells have a double dose of IGF2, resulting in an increased likelihood of tumour formation.  Therefore, disruption of imprinting at the H19/IGF2 cluster leads to over expression of growth factor, causing cells to proliferate inappropriately.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a cytidine analog and a member of the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi), has been FDA approved for treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Acute Myeloid Leukemia, two haematological malignancies.</p>
<p> Decitabine acts as a hypomethylating agent.  Once incorporated into the DNA, the drug is able to irreversibly bind DNMT, preventing further methylation.  The precise mode of action is unclear but since both these cancers are dependent on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation, a hypomethylating agent would intuitively have a therapeutic effect by reactivating tumour suppressor genes. There is evidence for demethylation and reactivation of the p15 tumour suppressor gene in pateints treated with decitabine.  </p>
<p>Other possible modes of action utilize DNA repair mechanisms and induction of apoptosis but additional pathways may also be involved.</p>
<p>Further investiation into the mechanism of action of decitabine and other azanucleosides will help maximize efficacy and minimize side effects, thus prolonging life expectancy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation (and unmethylation) is mitotically inherited and therefore can have lifelong effects on an individual.  In the case of decitabine, treatment can result in apoptotic sensitivity, which could subsequently make the tumour cells more effectively targeted for cell death by conventional chemotherapy.  </p>
<p>A sensitive period is a stage of development when epigenetic marks are being laid down on the chromatin and hence disturbances at this time would have long lasting, potentially detrimental implications to health. Any period of growth and development would be a sensitive period, but in particular, early embryonic development and germ cell development are critically sensitive.  Because epigenetic marks are essential for appropriate expression of genes, any disturbance during sensitive periods could have negative consequences.  Therefore treatments that disturb these epigenetic marks, including altering DNA methlation, should be avoided during these times.</p></div>
