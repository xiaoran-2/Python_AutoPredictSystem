    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence the expression of genes. CpG islands are often found at the promoter part of genes. This function is important for cell differentiation as well as X inactivation and imprinting. In cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands occurs, leading to silencing of genes, in particular tumour-suppressing genes. Without the expression of tumour suppressing genes, cancerous tumours can grow unchecked. </p>
<p>The normal functions of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements include suppressing the expression of repetitive regions, oncogenes, and imprinted genes. In cancer, hypomethylation of these regions occur genome-wide, resulting in genomic instability and activation of oncogenes. Genomic instability is manifested as inappropriate DNA recombinations, transpositions, deletions, insertions and so on. This contributes to tumorigenesis and flow-on epigenetic mutations such as alterations to histone modifiers. Ultimately, cancer arises as the "blueprints" for normal cellular controls, e.g., for tumour suppression and apoptosis, are degraded, damaged or destroyed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The hypermethylation of an imprinted gene control region can lead to overexpression of growth promoting genes. Taking the specific example of the H19/Igf2 imprint control region (ICR), the paternal ICR is normally methylated so that the Igf2 growth promoting gene is expressed. The maternal ICR is normally unmethylated, allowing CTCF protein to bind and prevent the expression of Igf2. In Wilm's tumour, both maternal and paternal ICRs are methylated, leading to an overexpression of Igf2. This results in tumour growth in the maturing kidneys of children as Igf2 is a growth promoting gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors, which means that it prevents DNMT from methylating DNA. In this way, Decitabine counters the cancer promoting effects of hypermethylation. In particular, tumour suppressing genes are no longer silenced and tumours that would otherwise lead to cancer are suppressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs can have effects lasting beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic changes due to the drugs are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells. This means that treated tumour cells that no longer have CGI hypermethylation will also not have CGI hypermethylated when they divide.</p>
<p>Such epigenetics drugs must be used with care. During sensitive periods of development, such as during implantation, germ cell development or tissue specific differentiation, epigenetic reprogramming is occurring that is sensitive to environmental influence. Epigenetic drugs can affect the epigenome and cause permanent epigenetic changes during this time that can have unintended consequences. For example, growth promoting genes may be suppressed as the result of epigenetic drug treatment, leading to stunting or malformation of developing organs. For this reason, treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.</p></div>
