    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer by locus specific DNA hypermethylation and genome- wide DNA hypomethlation. In cancer, alterations have different effects depending on different features such as location of tumor and location of altered genes. For instance, different tumours have different context dependencies (if DNA methylation is driven by tumor suppressor hypermethylation, then methylation suppresses tumorigenesis. If DNA methylation is driven by chromosomal instability, then methylation enhances tumorogenesis). DNA methylation at CpG islands normally functions as silencing of gene expression. In cancer, DNA hypermethylation silences tumor suppressor genes. When genes that regulate the cell cycle (tumor supressor genes) are silenced, cells will grow and reproduce uncontrollably, leading to tumorigenesis. The hypermethylated CpG islands are always not the same. They differ by the tumour type. The results of hypomethylation at CpG islands are location dependent. For instance DNA hypomethylation at CpG poor promoters results in oncogene activation. DNA methylation at intergenic regions normally maintains genomic integrity. DNA methylation at repetitive elements normally defends genome i.e. from transposable elements. In cancer, hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions leads to genomic instability such as illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is a <a title="Genetics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics">genetic</a> phenomenon by which certain <a title="Gene" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene">genes</a> can be <a title="Gene expression" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression">expressed</a> in a <a title="Parent" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent">parent</a>-of-origin-specific manner. It may also ensure transposable elements remain epigenetically silenced throughout gametogenic reprogramming to maintain genome integrity. Imprinted <a title="Allele" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele">alleles</a> are silenced such that the genes are either expressed only from the non-imprinted allele inherited from the mother, or in other instances from the non-imprinted allele inherited from the father. IGF2 and H19 are two imprinted genes located adjacent to each other at 11p15.5, a region which is frequently involved in cancer. In the case of IGF2 gene, only the paternally inherited allele is expressed while the maternal allele is silent. The H19 gene is oppositely imprinted and is expressed from only the maternal allele. Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. For instance, Wilm’s tumour is associated with hypermethylation. In Wilms tumour the imprinting of IGF2 is relaxed, that is the normally silent maternal allele becomes active and the gene is biallelically expressed. Biallelic IGF2 expression in Wilms tumours is accompanied by de novo methylation and silencing of the maternal H19 allele.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine sold as Dacogen, which is a DNA demethylating agent is an epigenetic drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine is one of the epigenetic inhibitors inhibiting the activity of an enzyme called EZH2 which methylates histone proteins. A lot of lymphomas are caused by mutations that make EZH2 overactive. Such overactivity methylates histones more than they should be and thus silences tumour-suppressor genes which stops uncontrolled cell growth. Silencing of tumour suppressor genes causes cancer as those genes cannot stop uncontrolled cell growth anymore. Decitabine can have an anti – tumour effect by inhibiting EZH2 enzyme. By inhibiting EZH2 enzyme, histone methylation can be also inhibited and thus silencing of tumour suppressor genes can be prevented. As a result, active tumour suppressor genes can stop uncontrolled cell growth, thus possible cancers by using Decitabine.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. DNA methylations leads to silencing of tumour suppressor genes thus, it may cause cancer. Therefore, continuous methylation of DNA can have side effects while cancer treatment. Sensitive period is a period in which cancer development still occurs. So during sensitive period, cancer treatment with drugs must be avoided as tumour development can continue in other parts during treatment.</span></p></div>
