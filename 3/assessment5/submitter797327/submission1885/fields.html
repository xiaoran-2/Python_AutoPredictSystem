    <div class="field-value"><p>Almost 70% of mammalian promoters are located at CpG islands. For that reason, DNA methylation is reduced at CpG islands, whereas in repetitive elements regions, intergenic regions and introns there is hypermethylation. In cancer cells, DNA methylation of CpG island is disrupted. This region is higlhly methylated, which is ususally associated with gene silencing. Promoters of tumor supressor genes can often be found at CpG island; it's hypermethylation leads to gene silencing and tumorigenesis. Beause they supress uncontrolled proliferation, their silencing often leads to tumor formation and growth. Not only CpG islands are affected, but also the shores of CpG that lies next to them. The spreading of methylation can lead to further gene inactivation and extreme consequences for cell self-renewal. Also, in intergenic regions and at repetitive elements the methylation pattern is disrupted. In cancer cells, they are commonly hypomethylated. Since they are the majority of the DNA, most cancer types confer genome-wide hypomethyletion. Activation of repetitive elements leads to genomic instalibity and increase in mutations, recombination, translocations, etc. An evidence of the link between hypomethylation and cancer is the fact tha a mice with a knockout  for DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in particular tissues results in cancer. Beisdes, CpG regions hypomethylation, which are poor in promoters, can activate genes that must be silenced for homeostasis. For instance, hypomethylation of miR21 gene results in its activation. This is a gene that targets PTEN, a tumor supressor; so that the hypomethylation increases the chances of tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster has differential methylation pattern in the paternal and maternal- inerited alleles. The imprinted difference of the maternal allele function as an enhancer blocking. The maternal allele is not methylated at the H19 gene nor at the CTCF binding site. When CTCF, an insulator protein, binds to the allele, it block Igf2 expression, because the enhancers can only induce H19 expression. The paternal allele is methylated at the H19 gene and at the CTCF binding site. Since the insulator can't bind to the DNA site anymore and H19 is silenced, the enhancers can activate Igf2 expression. In Wilm's tumor, which tipically occur in children, envolves a loss of imprinting in the materanal allele. The child has two paternal-like alleles, instead of one. It resuts in Igf-2 overexpression, which is correlated with Wilm's tumor's features. Igf-2 is a growth-promoter hormone in gestation, thus, a oncogene. It's overregulation means excess of growth and tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), which inhibits the ability of the cell to methylate cytosine residues. When decitabine is administred, it blocks DNMT acitivty, which leads to passive demethylation in every cell division. The result is an overall demethylation. When the tumor dependecy is driven by tumor supressor hypermethylation, decitabine presents therapeutic benefits at low doses. Decitabine anti-tumorous effect comes from the reactivation of tumor supressors. The superiority of this epigenetic approach over traditional chemotherapics relies on the facts that epigenetic machinery alteration can stop tumors from growing without killing all its cells. In the article,decitabine is described as a drug already available in the market to treat myelodysplastic syndrome.  Nonetheless, it is still uncertain the effects of drug administration in normal cells. An undesirable coleteral effect that might appear is the hypomethylation in normal cells, which can lead into genomic instability and increasing tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because once decreased methylation cell content, it takes some cell divisions in order to reestablish methylation pattern. Meanwhile, some key genes that can help prognosis can be active. They might be genes which expression results in a protein that could interact with standard chemotherapics and increase their ability to kill cancer cells. Nonetheless, the case presented above is temporary. There is a small window which could increase prognosis of treatments. DNA methylation is known to have enduring effets on epigenomes in two sensitive period, where epigenetic marks are being reestablished: in primordial germ cells development, and in early embryonic development. In the first, there is a decrease in methylation content firts to remove somatic marks, and then reimprinted marks of one gender. In the former, there is demethylation before implantation, and then they are reestablished for tissue commitment. It is not advisable to treat pregnant pacients with epigenetic altering drugs because two of the most important sensitive periods are present in the prenatal period.</p></div>
