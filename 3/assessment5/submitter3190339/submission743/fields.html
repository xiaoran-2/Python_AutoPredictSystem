    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, certain CpG islands feature heavy DNA methylation, which is when a methyl group is attached to cytosine to form 5-methyl cytosine. When many CpG dinucleotides are clustered together, they form a CpG island, which is often a promoter of a nearby gene; when an island is methylated, it causes the DNA to adopt a more compact and repressive chromatin structure while also prohibiting transcription factors from binding, which leads to the silencing of the connected gene. Normally, most such islands remain unmethylated, which allows gene expression.</p>
<p>One epigenetic feature of cancer is the hypermethylation of CpG islands (i.e. too many islands that are not methylated in a normal cell become methylated). These CpG islands are often connected to tumor suppressor genes; thus, in cancer, this hypermethylation represses tumor suppressor genes and allows tumors to grow more freely.</p>
<p>In contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements usually do feature methylation. Scientists currently believe that this methylation tends to help maintain genomic integrity by silencing and/or mutating repeats to prevent transposition or illegitimate recombinations of DNA; silencing the repeats could also help avoid transcriptional interference from promoters.</p>
<p>An epigenetic feature of cancer is that intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally not as methylated as normal cells (“hypomethylated”). This means that all the benefits of methylation described above are lost, which generally leads to genomic instability. Effects of hypomethylation include increased frequency of illegitimate recombinations between repeat regions, deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations.  This hypomethylation is a very common feature of cancer and contributes to cellular instability and unexpected behavior (or lack of expected behavior).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Considering the H19/Igf2 cluster on human chromosome 11, there is an imprint control region (ICR) that, when unmethylated, allows insulator CTCF to bind. Upstream of this ICR is the Igf2 gene, while downstream is the H19 gene and  various enhancers. The presence of CTCF protects Igf2 from the effects of the downstream enhancers, which instead impact H19. This is the case in the maternal allele, which does not feature ICR methylation. In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, which prevents CTCF binding, thus exposing Igf2 to downstream enhancers.  The ICR in this situation is considered “enhancer blocking”, since in the unmethylated state it blocks enhancers from amplifying Igf2.</p>
<p>Wilm’s tumor is a type of kidney tumor that can occur in children and is one potential feature of Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS), a disorder caused by incorrect activity of this ICR. Here, a maternal allele acts like the paternal allele; there is disruption in imprinting and over-enhancement of Igf2, along with abnormalities in the upstream Kcnq1 cluster.  The overdose of Igf2, loss of related Cdkn1c expression, and other consequences of this abnormality result in fetal and post-natal overgrowth, causing symptoms including large tongues and Wilms’ tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According to the article, Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating, and thus cancer-treating, drug that is already on the market. In general, one epigenetic feature of cancer is that normally tumor-suppressing genes in a healthy genome are silenced by some mutation that causes excess methylation. Methylation is a naturally-occurring phenomenon caused by methyltransferases, such as DNMT3a, or, as cited by the article, EZH2, and describes the process of methyl groups being attached to cytosines in DNA. This methylation, especially at “CpG islands” in the genome, causes the chromatin to come together in a more tightly-packed configuration, which inhibits the transcription of those now-inaccessible genes; in some cases these genes are tumor suppressants, and thus their inactivity leads to uncontrolled tumor growth.  Decitabine purportedly removes the excess methylation affecting cancerous cells, which would allow tumor suppressing genes to begin expressing again, thus acting as a cancer treatment.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Certain aspects of epigenetics can be passed on from parent cell to daughter cell (and thus potentially to offspring as well); thus, DNA methylation could have enduring effects beyond the period of drug treatment. For example, scientists have discovered that methylation of CPG islands is maintained through replication by methyltransferases such as DNMT1; after parent DNA with two strands of methylated CpG islands splits apart, DNMT1 acts upon the hemi-methylated DNA strands to methylate the new strand appropriately.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are, however, “sensitive periods” in an organism’s life cycle when such epigenetic marks are “reset”; in mammals the two major sensitive periods are the transition from fertilization to blastocyst, and the development of gametes from primordial germ cells. If epigenetic drugs take effect by impacting abnormal methylation, for example, these effects would not last through a sensitive period, since in that time all the methylation marks are erased.  In other words, while the drugs would still reduce abnormal methylation in the parent cell (and perhaps restore proper tumor suppressant behavior), they will not necessarily impact the daughter cells that were created during a sensitive period, and thus the drugs will not have an effect beyond the period of treatment.</p></div>
