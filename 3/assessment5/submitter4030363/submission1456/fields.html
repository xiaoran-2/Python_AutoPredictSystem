    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic process that involves the addition of a methyl group to the 5’ position of cytosine and has the overall effect of gene silencing. DNA methylation typically occurs at promoter regions that are rich in cytosine-guanine dinucleotides, called CpG islands. In cancer, DNA methylation at GpC islands is disrupted such that tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated at their promoters and their expression is reduced. Reduced expression of these genes contributes to disease by facilitating the growth of cancer-related tumours. For example, promoter hypermethylation of tumours suppressor gene RB has been implicated in the growth of retinoblastomas while BRCA1 and MGMT has been identified in breast cancer and colorectal cancer, respectively.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated in the genome. This facilitates genetic stability by promoting the non-expression of transposable elements - DNA sequences that can spontaneously change their position and cause genetic mutations. In cancer, DNA methylation is disrupted in intergenic regions and repetitive elements such that there is hypomethylation at these regions, leading to genetic instability.  This hypomethylated state can contribute to disease by inducing the expression of transposable elements and the mutation of proto-oncogenes. Hypomethylation can also contribute to cancer by increasing the expression of pre-existing mutated oncogenes that would not otherwise be expressed. As per the Knudson hypothesis, this could then interact with other genomic and epigenomic  ‘hits’ to DNA to cause and progress to development of cancer. For example, hypomethylation of HOTAIR lncRNA results in the overexpression of HOTAIR and the subsequent hypermethylation of H3K27 and demethylation of H3K4. This ultimately leads to the reduced expression of tumours suppressor genes and the development of cancer and metastasis in breast cancer.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genetic imprinting is under the control of DNA methylation at imprinting control regions (ICRS) so that imprinted alleles are silenced to achieve monoallelic expression of genes. Under normal imprinting conditions for the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele for H19 is imprinted. This means that the ICR of the H19 paternal allele is hypermethylated and the binding of CTCF is restricted. This results in the expression of Igf2 and the non-expression of H19. On the other hand, the non-imprinted maternal allele ICR is unmethylated. Under these circumstances, CTCF is allowed to bind and there is a loss in the expression of Igf2 while H19 is expressed. In Wilm’s tumour, the imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster is perturbed so that there is hypermethylation on the ICR for <em>both</em> the maternal and paternal alleles. This results in no expression of H19 and overexpression of Igf2. This can contribute to disease as H19 is a potential tumour suppressor gene and therefore its non-expression can facilitate the growth of tumours.  Igf2 is a growth factor and can therefore contribute to disease as its overexpression can promote irregular cell growth and cell proliferation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleotide analog that belongs to a class of drugs referred to as DNA methyltransferase inhibitiors (DNMTi). DNMTis are directly incorporated into DNA and inhibit DNA methylation by stopping DNMTs from attaching the methyl groups to cytosines, thereby leading to a hypomethylation state over time. Given that the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated in cancer, decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by reducing the hypermethylation of the tumour suppressor promoters to restore the normal function of these genes. This would therefore reactivate these loci and would result in the functional suppression of potential tumours. Decitabine could also have an anti-tumour effect by creating a cytotoxic cellular environment, particularly at high doses, thereby facilitating the targeting and apoptosis of proliferating cancerous cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation through drug treatments can have enduring effects on the epigenome as epigenetic drugs, such as decitabine, are permanently incorporated into the DNA itself, meaning that their effects can endure beyond the initial period of drug administration. Further, as the DNA methylation pattern of cells is mitotically heritable, the altered methylation state can be passed down through successive cell divisions. While these drugs show potential in the treatment of diseased states, caution should be used when using them during ‘sensitive periods’. Sensitive periods refer to points in time where changes to the environment can have a significant effect on the epigenetic control of cell regulation. For example, embryogenesis and gametogenesis are typically viewed as sensitive periods as changes to the epigenetic state during this time have been implicated in the aetiology of disease and in transgenerational epigenetic inherence, respectively. Therefore, treating patients during sensitive periods is not advisable as altering the epigenetic state could not only render the individual susceptible to disease, but these epigenetic changes could also be passed down to the individual’s offspring. </p></div>
