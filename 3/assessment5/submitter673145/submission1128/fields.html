    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is normally rare at CpG islands, but associated with gene suppression when it does occur. DNA hyper-methylation (extra methylation) at CpG islands in tumor-suppressing genes can occur in cancer. This helps tumor cells to grow and out-compete normal cells.</p>
<p>At intergenic region and repetitive elements, DNA methylation normally helps to maintain genomic stability - that is, methylation helps to prevent chromosomes from gaining/losing genes or having illegitimate recombinations. One way methylation helps with this is by densely packaging these sections into heterochromotin. In cancer, DNA hypo-methylation (too little methylation) can occur at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. The stability-promoting features of methylation do not occur, and there is gene instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer can be associated with either hyper- or hypo- methylation in imprint control regions (ICR's). In the case of H19/Igf2 cluster, cancer is associated with hyper-methylation.</p>
<p>Normally in the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is methylated, and so enhancers are not blocked from acting on Igf2, so Igf2 is active and the enhancers don't act on H19. In the maternal allele, normally the CTCF in the ICR is unmethylated, so enhancers are blocked from acting on Igf2, so Igf2 is silent and the enhancers act on H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, we get methylation in the maternal allele as well as the paternal allele, so Igf2 is expressed there as well, so we have a double dose of Igf2, which is growth-promoting. This extra growth-promoting Igf2 helps cancer cells to grow and spread.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA-<span>-demethylating agent. Like other DNMT-inhibitors, Decitabine is incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then DNMT binds to the DNA, it is bound irreversibly, so it cannot be released, so overall methylation is decreased. This affects all cell types, but it depends on cell replication to take effect, so it will affect cancer cells more than normal cells. Since many cancers depend on DNA hyper-methylation, this can counteract some cancers (for example, haematalogical malignancies).</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so its effects can last through many cell replications. Sensitive periods are periods where epigenetic control is especially sensitive to changes in the environment. This is when normal epigenetic function can most easily be disrupted. The two primary sensitive periods are from primordial germ cell development through the completion of mature egg and sperm development. The second sensitive period occurs from pre-implantation to early post-implantation.</p>
<p>Both of these sensitive periods are sensitive because they are periods of active epigenetic reprogramming (removal of epigenetic marks and laying down new ones). Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these periods is inadvisable because epigenetic drugs can affect all cell types (not just cancer cells) and could result in serious errors in epigenetic programming if carried out during this period.</p></div>
