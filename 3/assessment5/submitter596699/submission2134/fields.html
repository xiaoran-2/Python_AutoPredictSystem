    <h1>Submission 2134 from Anon (session_user_id: edd0fb057efeaa9b7a16b64a99fd2184fcdaf9bc)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because DNA methylation patterns are often mitotically heritable.  Once a cytosine residue has become methylated on one strand of DNA, methylation will often occur on the symmetrical paired site on the other parentally derived DNA strand. As we learned in class, there are dedicated enzymes such as DNMT1 that specifically recognize a methylation/non-methylation mismatch and will actively methylate the unmethylated paired strand once a new cell is formed. Furthermore, these DNA methylations will be carried forward into the progeny cells that are produced by mitotic division. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I would avoid treating patients during a "sensitive period", which can be defined as a time during which the process of epigenetic "reprogramming" takes place.  This is when epigenetic marks in cells are being removed and/or "reset".  Two very important sensitive periods of development are during embryogenesis as well as during primordial germ cell development.  Treating patients who are pregnant or who are in puberty can risk toxicity to the cells of the embryo or primordial germ cells as this process of reprogramming can be disturbed resulting in birth defects or unpredictable hereditable epigenetic marks.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating/demethyating agent that is incorporated into DNA as a cytidine analog and inhibits DNA methyltransferase (that is, Decitabine is a member of the "DNMT inhibitors" class of epigenetic inhibitors).  By inhibiting DNA methylation, Decitabine can interfere with tumor growth that is dependent on tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation at CpG islands.  In other words, some tumors grow because of the reduction of tumor suppressor gene function due to an abnormal increase in methylation at a CpG island located at the promoter site of the tumor suppressor gene.  By preventing this hypermethylation, Decitabine can increase the level of the product of the tumor suppressor gene and this will inhibit the growth of the tumor.  It is believed that this mechanism explains the beneficial effect of Decitabine on myelodysplastic syndromes as well as other tumor types which are dependent upon a reduction in function of tumor suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal adult mammals the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is imprinted - the paternal allele contains an epigenetic mark that alters its transcription function.  This paternal epigenetic mark is the hypermethylation of the Imprint Control Region (ICR) and the proximal end of the H19 transcription region: these hypermethylations result in suppressed transcription of the H19 region and enhanced transcription of the Igf2 region.  This paternal transcription activity contrasts with that of the maternal allele which displays enhanced transcription of the H19 region and suppressed transcription of the Igf2 region.  The difference in activities between the alleles results from the binding of CTCF - an insular protein molecule - to the ICR in the maternal allele but not in the paternal allele due to the presence of hypermethylation there.  </p>
<p>However, in pre-neoplastic tissue or cancer, abnormal hypermethylation occurs at the ICR in the maternal allele which causes it to act like the paternal allele with regards to H19 and Igf2 transcription.  The result is that a cancerous cell has twice the level of Igf2 expression and a decrease in H19 expression.  A double dose of Igf2 - a growth factor - contributes to the abnormal growth seen in Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence the genes - that is to decrease the transcription products - in whose promotor regions they occur.  DNA methylation is an essential function in the normal development of the mammalian fetus and is necessary for life; prevention of DNA methylation by deleting genes necessary for this function - such as by the creation of knockout mice negative for both copies of DNMT1 - is fatal in utero.  Once a normal gestation is completed, DNA methylation patterns are mitotically heritable and become established in a tissue-specific manner.  These tissue-specific epigenetic marks are one of the reasons for different genes being expressed in different tissues of the body and are essential to normal body function.</p>
<p>In cancer, there is a hypermethylation of the promoter CpG islands throughout the genome, although the actual specific pattern of hypermethylations varies among tumor types and in fact can sometimes be useful for identifying tumor type and subtype.  When hypermethylation occurs at promoter regions of tumor suppressor cells, these tumor suppressors are inhibited which in turn can promote tumor growth.  </p>
<p>However, in cancer there is also a hypomethylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  These repetitive elements present in so-called "junk DNA" are believed to be a form of parasitic life that can reproduce at the expense of cellular resources.  Normally, methylation in these regions helps suppress these transposon-like regions from activating, duplicating, and translocating to other areas of the genome.  Once these methylations are lost, however, these regions can activate and result in genetic destabilization that can result in chromosome translocations and aneuploidy as a result of abnormal pairing of like elements with each other which promotes cancer grown.  The "jumping" of transposons can also result in the activation of tumor genes directly.</p></div>
