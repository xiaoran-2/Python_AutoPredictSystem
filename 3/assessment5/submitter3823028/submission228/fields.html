    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells most CpG dinucleotides are methylated at the C5 position of cytosine base but CpG islands are generally left hypomethylated as they are present at the promoter region and methylation can restrict the underlying gene expression by silencing the gene. In cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to be methylated thus silencing the underlying gene. The hypermethylation of CpG islands located at the promoter region of tumour suppressor genes can silence the tumour suppressor gene and the control on the cell growth will be lost resulting in the tumour growth and cancer. Some examples of hypermethylation are - RB gene in retinoblastoma, MLH1 locus in colorectal cancer, BRCA1 in breast cancer and MGMT in gliomas and colorectal cancer. Methylation at CpG islands has different identity in different tumour types and it progresses with time. It also spreads at the CpG island shores till 2kb regions.</p>
<p>Whereas, in normal cells the intergenic regions, repetitive elements and some introns of genes have hypermethylation that keeps these regions silenced and densely packed in heterochromatin. In cancer cells these regions are in general hypomethylated. The hypomethylation in repetive elements and intergenic regions can result in Genomic instability like deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the chromosomes by Illegitimate recombination between repeats; the methylated regions are silenced and densely packed in heterochromatin in normal cells but when they are hypomethylated they loosen up and becomes a part of euchromatin thus taking part in the recombination event. On the removal of methylation the repeats gets activated and can make copy of themselves and transpose and integrate itself within a coding region thus disrupting the coding region. This might activate cryptic promoters and disrupt neighbouring genes thus contributing to the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint control regions (ICR) are involved in growth so any DNA methylation alterations in those regions results in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. The loss of imprinting by hypo or hypermethylation are often seen in pre-neoplastic tissues.</p>
<p><br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-a48b9b316a8363a4200248ab/970238/asst-5/970238-52090564ede744.61393015.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>For example in H19/Igf2 cluster in normal cells the ICR is methylated in paternal allele so CTCF cannot bind to it and the enhancers can enhance the Igf2 expression and H19 remains silent. Whereas, the ICR is unmethylated in maternal allele thus allowing CTCF to bind it and the enhancers will act on H19 gene expression keeping Igf2 silent.</p>
<p>With loss of imprinting, both the alleles are hypermethylated resulting in the overexpression of Igf2 from both the alleles and enabling the tumour growth thus showing Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation occurs at CpG dinucleotides, helps in maintaining genomic stability, plays role in gene silencing. So altering DNA methylation at CpG islands results in abnormality in growth control, genomic instability by random chromosomal deletions, insertions and recombination events. It is laid down by DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs) and is mitotically heritable because of DNMT1 activity in the daughter cells, can be removed actively or passively during epigenetic reprogramming.<br />During the growth of an embryo there are some stages of epigenetic reprogramming where the epigenetic marks are actively and passively removed, these periods are called sensitive periods. There are two sensitive periods: the pre-implantation period during early embryonic development and the primordial germ cell development. In the pre-implantation period at the early embryonic development the paternal genome is rapidly and actively demethylated and the maternal genome is passively demethylated with cell division. At the primordial germ cell development phase there is a differential resetting of the DNA methylation in spermatogenesis and in oogenesis. So any alterations done in DNA methylation during these sensitive periods can show the affects in subsequent generations of the individual as the alterations are passed on to next generations by the germ cells. Thus, <span>treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi), <span>sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. </span>It is a nucleoside analogue and gets incorporated into the DNA and binds irreversibly to DNMTs thus resulting in DNA demethylation. This being replication dependent effects the cancer cells because the cancer cells replicate more rapidly. The DNA demethylation results in hypomethylation of CpG islands present at the promoters of tumour suppressor genes and hence showing an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>
