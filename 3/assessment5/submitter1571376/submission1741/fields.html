    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer causes the global loss and site-specific gain of DNA methylation. This results in genomic instability, altered expression of tissue specific and imprinted genes, and the inhibition of tumour suppressor genes through CpG island hypermethylation.<br /><br /> The methylation status of CpG islands confers epigenetic information as to the activation or repression of adjacent genes. DNA methylation of CpG islands is associated with transcriptional silencing and in a normal cell, these sites tend to be hypomethylated. Perturbation of the epigenetic state during cancer increases the likelihood that these CpG islands are hypermethylated in a locus specific manner. To the detriment of the patient, hypermethylated CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes contributes to the insult on DNA that results in the cancer condition. That is, tumour suppressor genes are suppressed and the cell has the competitive advantage to divide more rapidly, escape apoptosis and replace normal tissue.</p>
<p>DNA methylation of intergenic and repetitive elements is under normal circumstances required to maintain genomic stability. Through global hypermethylation, these regions are densely packed into hetrochromatin preventing aberrant recombination and transposition. In cancer, the genome becomes hypomethylated and results in a more open, euchromatic state. The consequence of this includes; in appropriate recombination between repetitive elements, activation of transposable elements resulting in gene inhibiting insertions or gene activation, and the activation of cryptic promoters altering neighbouring gene expression. The resulting deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations contribute to the disease state and these are examples of how changes in the epigenetic state can result in an alternative DNA sequence. The cancer cell then selects for mutations and epimutaions which endows it a competitive advantage to escape cell death and proliferate unabated. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are generally involved in cellular growth, and hence loss of imprint control is a common feature of cancer cells. <br />The H19/Igf2 cluster has an imprint control region (ICR) in cis, with the methylation pattern determining the monoallelic parent of origin specific expression. The ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. Unmethylated maternal ICR is bound by CTCF resulting in the proximal enhancers to acting on H19 and causing its expression, while the Igf2 gene remains silent. On the paternal allele, methylated ICR means CTCF is not bound, the H19 gene is methylated and the enhancers act on Igf2, causing Igf2 expression.<br /> Loss of imprint control at the H19/Igf2 cluster, results in hypermethylation of the maternal allele causing maternal Igf2 expression in addition to the expression from the paternal allele. This double dose of Igf2 promotes growth and the condition known as Wilm’s tumour. This growth promoting phenotype is an early event in tumourigenesis contribting to the disease state. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor belonging to the nucleoside analogue family of drugs used to treat cancer. Decitabine gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and when the DNMT methyltransferase binds to this nucleoside analoge it is irreversible, preventing DNMT to advance on the DNA. Hence the action of the methyltransferase is inhibited and DNA methylation is reduced. This drug has an anti-tumour effect, as the process of DNMT DNA methylation is replication dependent. Therefore, proliferating cells such as cancers will be more severely affected then normal tissue. By targeting the deleterious effects of epigenomic mutations in cancerous cells that cause genomic instability and tumour suppressor gene inhibition, the drug prevents further growth and proliferation of the tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation are non-specific in their action. DNA methylation has a functional role in gene silencing and imprint control. Use of these drugs can cause global changes in methylation patterns, detrimentally affecting epigenetic regulation. Special care must also be taken in the administration of these drugs during sensitive periods of DNA methylation removal and addition. Sensitive periods refer to two waves of reprogramming during the pre-implantation early development period and the primordial germ cell development. The former is characterised by global demethylation and reestablishement of methylation in a cell type specific manner and the latter exhibits the removal of somatic cell marks and the establishment of a specific germ cell methylation pattern. Perturbation in these developmental time points would have detrimental consequences during lineage specification, while affecting the correct epigenome establishment  during primordial germ cell development could result in trans-generational side-effects. Hence it would be ill-advised to use such drugs during sensitive periods.</p></div>
