    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG islands are lacking in DNA methylation, and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements have methylation. However, in cancer cells, this gets reversed; CpG islands become hypermethylated, and methylation is lost in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>When heavy methylation occurs in the CpG islands, it results in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and leads to out-of-control cell growth. This is seen frequently in particular clinical tumors. Additionally, long-range epigenetic silencing, or LRES, can be seen in cancer cells, which consists of large regions of the DNA that are heavily methylated. When extensive regions of the genome are methylated and too many tumor suppressor genes become silenced, this leads to the disease phenotype that is cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is usually seen in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, and this helps keep the genome stable. Oncogenes, along with the rest of the genes in the area, are regulated by the presence of this methylation. When the DNA methylation in these regions is disrupted, there is a large increase in genomic instability, resulting in mistakes in recombination, activation of repeats, and disruption to neighboring genes. Genome-wide hypomethylation contributes to disease by activating genes that shouldn’t be activated, and when this is paired with the hypermethylation of CpG islands, it will almost always result in some type of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A common feature of many types of cancer is that the genes lose their imprinting, resulting in expression or silencing of genes by both parental alleles. Imprinted genes are usually involved in cell growth, so disruptions in these genes often lead to cancer. In the H19/Igf2 cluster, methylation patterns differ between the maternal and paternal alleles. The imprint control region (ICR) of the maternal allele is unmethylated, so CTCF binds to it. Once the region is insulated, the enhancers can work on H19, and Igf2 is silent on the maternal allele. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, so CTCF doesn’t bind to it. Instead, the methylation pattern causes the enhancers to act on Igf2, and H19 is silent on the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation can occur in the ICR of certain genes. In the disease phenotype of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR of the maternal allele becomes hypermethylated, causing it to act like the paternal allele; CTCF doesn’t bind to the ICR, and the enhancers work on Igf2. This results in a “double-dose” of Igf2 and silencing of H19. Overexpression of Igf2, a growth-promoting gene, causes a Wilm’s tumor, a specific type of pediatric kidney tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A new method being used to treat cancer is drugs that target the epigenetic machinery of genes. The benefit of this type of treatment is that it aims to “reprogram” the cancer cells to their non-cancerous state instead of killing them, which can have terrible side effects for the patient.</p>
<p>Decitabine, an epigenetic drug, is a DNA-demethylating agent that is currently on the market for treating myelodysplastic syndromes, precursors to acute myeloid leukemia. Decitabine works by demethylating genes that have been hypermethylated, which, in the case of cancer, are usually tumor-suppressor genes that have been silenced. When the excess methylation is removed from these genes, they can resume their normal function of inhibiting abnormal cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. If the methylation pattern of the cancer cell is changed, then the cancer cell’s daughter cells, granddaughter cells, and so on will display the same pattern. If this pattern is altered in a way that makes the cell more susceptible to standard chemotherapy, that trait will be inherited by all the future tumor cells.</p>
<p>That being said, there are certain periods of development when patients should avoid getting these types of drugs. These sensitive periods are when the epigenetic marks are most susceptible to changes, and they occur immediately after fertilization, during the formation of the blastocyst, and during primordial germ cell development and formation of the gametes. Treating patients during these periods is inadvisable because the drugs could alter the epigenome in a way that they shouldn’t. For example, a DNA-demethylating agent could lead to genome-wide hypomethylation, which could in turn lead to the activation of oncogenes. For this reason, children and pregnant women should not be given epigenetic drugs.</p></div>
