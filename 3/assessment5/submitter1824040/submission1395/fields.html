    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is often associated with gene silencing. Its primary mechanism of silencing is the condensation of chromatin.  Methylated CpGs are bound by methyl binding proteins which have a transcriptional repression domain, but can also recruit other factors that condense chromatin.  The secondary mechanism for silencing is by methylated CpGs blocking transcription factors from binding DNA (preventing transcription).</p>
<p>Typically, methylation in normal cells shows a pattern of hypomethylation at CpG islands, and hypermethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In cancer, reciprocal inversion of methylation status often occurs.</p>
<p>CpG islands are often found in the promoter region of genes.  The unmethylated state in normal cells results in less chromatin condensation and facilitates transcription.  In cancers, CpGs are often inappropriately methylated, silencing transcription of genes.  This is particularly problematic when tumor suppressor genes are silenced, allowing cell growth to go unchecked.</p>
<p>Methylation of CpGs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are both thought to help maintain genomic integrity/stability.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions prevents transcription of cryptic promoters downstream a gene  of interest in normal cells.  In a cancerous cell, an unmethylated cryptic promoter can be transcribed at the same time, but in the opposite direction of the gene of interest; the two RNA polymerase II molecules can run into one another resulting in truncated RNA molecules with impaired function. Additionally, cells without maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 show abnormal karyotype.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements are mutagenic and thus methylated in normal cells.  Methylation of long terminal repeats in IAPs prevents their transcription, transposition, strong downstream promoters or cryptic promoters from transcribing inappropriately into surrounding genes, and illegitimate recombination with other repetitive regions.  Methylated cytosines can also deaminate to thymine, ensuring IAP silencing in normal cells. When IAPs are unmethylated, they wreak havoc on surrounding gene transcription and potentially interrupt other genes during transposition. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting disruption can cause inappropriate silencing or "double dosing" of gene expression.</p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster works mainly by enhancer blocking.  Igf2 is an oncogene that lies upstream of the ICR; the ICR is upstream of H19; and H19 is upstream of the enhancers.</p>
<p>In normal cells, the maternal allele is unmethylated at the H19/Igf2 ICR, while the paternal allele is methylated at the ICR (imprinted). </p>
<p>The preferred mechanism is for the enhancers to act on Igf2, resulting in expression of Igf2. The unmethylated, maternal ICR binds the insulator protein CTCF.  Downstream enhancers are therefore unable to act on Igf2 due to CTCF insulation (resulting in no expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele).  Enhancers instead act on lncRNA H19.</p>
<p>The methylated paternal ICR cannot bind CTCF. Methylation from the ICR also spreads into the H19 promoter.  Downstream enhancersare then free to act on Igf2, resulting in Igf2 expression, while H19 is silenced.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, the maternal ICR is inappropriately methylated.  This essentially leads to a double dose of Igf2 expression.  Because Igf2 is growth-promoting, a double dose leads to a type of childhood kidney cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA-approved DNMT inhibitor used in the treatment of AML. The drug works as a nucleoside analog, and is incorporated into the DNA during replication.  When DNMT1 binds the hemi-methylated DNA to copy methylation information to the daughter strand, it is bound irreversibly to the DNA and can no longer be released. Because it cannot be released, there is an effective "depletion" of DNMT1 in the cell, thereby leading to a dilution of methylation information in subsequent daughter cells.</p>
<p>Decitabine is replication-dependent.  Although it is not specific to cancer cells, cancer cells rapidly divide and are thus more readily impacted than normally dividing cells in the body.  DNA methyltransferase inhibitors appear to have the best anti-neoplastic effect at lower doses that result in enough impact to reduce methylation but not so high as to result in toxic, non-specific action on all cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation information is mitotically heritable.  By changing epigenitc marks of a daughter cell, subsequent cells from that lineage will inherit those changed epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>Because DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are don't specifically target only cancer cells, it is important to know that the drugs could be affecting any dividing cell.  In adults, long-term effects of these drugs is less improtant than patient survival and/or improvement of quality of life.  In younger patients, we must worry about sensitive periods - developmental times in which the epigenetic marks are reprogrammed.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods include early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>During early embryonic development, parental genome methylation is removed to allow for totipotency.  By gastrulation, methylation reaches a global low. Around the time of implantation, epigenetic marks are re-established, and somatic marks are for the most part maintained. </p>
<p>At mid-gestation, primordial germ cells in the embryo develop. Primordial germ cells are derived from somatic cells and therefore require removal of somatic marks and specialized chromatin packing.</p>
<p>Disruption of epigenetic marks at sensitive periods can lead to improper erasure or resetting of marks that will last a lifetime and potentially will affect subsequent generations via primordial germ cells.</p></div>
