    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>in the normal cell, CpG island are unmethyled and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methyled. this methylation is a protection against transposable elements and genomic instabillity.</p>
<p>in the cancer cell, CpG island are methyled and the intergenic regions and repetiitive elemnts are unmethyled.</p>
<p>the DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>in the time, 5mC dicrease and CpG island methylation increase</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>in the partenal allele, IRC are methyled. igf2 is expressed</p>
<p>inthe maternal allele, irc are unmethyled. igf2 is not exressed</p>
<p> </p>
<p>in the Wilm tumor the two alleles are  hypermethyled.</p></div>
