    <h1>Submission 2206 from Anon (session_user_id: a769433ce998264d1797448194a560afae981943)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of hypo<span>methylating drugs.  <br />Decitabine does this by blocking methyltransferase, the enzym used to transfer a methyl-group to DNA, so the description of demethylating agent isn't fully correct, it doesn't actively remove methyl groups, it inhibits the speed with which DNA methylation occurs.  <br /></span>  <br />One of the causes of cancer can be the epigenetic silencing through hypermethylation of CpG islands near promotors of genes that suppress tumours.  <br />These epimutations are mitotically heritable, but is reversible.  <br />  <br />Drugs like Decitabine counter this hypermethylation by blocking methyltransferase resulting in less methylation of the CpG islands, which results in the activation of the formerly silenced tumour repressor genes. These 'hypohypermethylated' (if you will) epigenetics are also mitotically heritable reducing the amount of tumour cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I had a lack of time, so I've only been able to do question 3 and question 4, and even those answers are short.  <br />But I kindly ask of you to do review those answers and grade them appropiately. Thank you. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically inherited, this way it will have an enduring effect.  <br />  <br />Although there are some periods, so called sensitive periods, in which epigenetic reprogramming happens.  <br /> These two periods are during primordial germ cell development/germ cell development and secondly during early development of an embryo (up until the blastocyst).  <br />  <br />Treating a patient during a sensitive period is inadvisable as it will disrupt the epigenetic reprogramming.<br /> </p></div>
