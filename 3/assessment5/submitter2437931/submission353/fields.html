    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of CpG islands in a normal state is<strong> hypo</strong>methylated which is low level methylation which allows imprint control regions (icr) to function. In cancer, the reverse is true; CpG islands are <strong>hyper</strong>methylated which is high level methylation so genes in promoters of tumor suppressors are turned off. This can be done genetically by mutations or epigenetically by methylation. When done epigenetically it is easier to reverse, but, either one can contribute to disease since imprint control regions are suppressed.  CpG island methylation increases as we age so perhaps cancer is a disease of age.</p>
<p>Most of the genome is made of intergenic regions or repetitive elements. In a normal cell these regions are hypermethylated which keeps repetitive elements from moving around the genome. In the case of cancer, the intergenic and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. Hypermethylation is most common at repeats and since hypermethylation is there to maintain genomic stability hypomethylation allows repeats to be free to make copies of themselves and jump around the genome and into intergenic regions. Repeats can cause deletions, insertions and translocations in any part of the genome, therefore, genomic instability can cause disease.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes undergo reprogramming in primodial germ cells but resist reprogramming in early development.  Imprinted genes have monoallelic gene expression. Only one of the alleles is expressed but comes from the parent of origin. The controlling element for imprinting is the imprint control region (icr).</p>
<p> If a gene is paternally imprinted there will be methylation on paternal control region,  but not on the maternal control region.  On the paternal control H19/lgf2 cluster, the paternal allele is methylated and expressed. CTCF, an isolator protein, isolates lgf2 from downstream enhancers.  DNA methylation at icr blocks ctcf and without ctcf dna methylation spreads to h19 promoter which silences it and enhancers can activate lgf2.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele the icr is unmetholated which allows ctcf to block enhancers from getting to lgf2 so no expression of lgf2 is seen on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>With loss of imprinting there is methylation on the maternal allele and paternal allele which allows lgf2 to be expressed on both alleles.  Lgf2 is growth promoting so this gives a double dose of lgf2 and this condition is associated with Wilm's tumor. Disrupting imprinting at the h19/lgf2 cluster causes more growth promotion which could cause tumors and cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an anti-cancer chemotherapy drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and is a form of a demethylation drug. This  drug has been approved by the FDA . Decitabine being a demthylation drug removes methylaton and in some cases this can be very beneficial.  One example of how this works on cancer is by demethylation which can restore the function of a tumor suppressor gene that has been methylated. This will allow the tumor suppressor gene to function and have an effect on tumors.</p>
<p>Decitabine also belongs to a class of drugs that do not appear to have many unusual side effects. The reason for this is that they target rapidly dividing cells so the cancer gets more of the drug than normal cells and smaller doses can be used, therefore, there are less side effects.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of both paternal and maternal alleles can result in imprinted genes that function improperly. Epigenetic changes are passed on to daughter and granddaughter cells during cell division until they are actively removed.  Once removed they do not come back and it could be that epigenetic therapies can make changes that stop a cancer from growing without having to destroy all of its cells as seen in the use of Decitabine. In the future, there may be other drugs that target a specific mutated form of recurring protein which should not effect the neighboring cells.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is the time when genetic imprinting may have the most effect on the body and on future generations.  Since sensitive periods are from primodial germ cells to mature eggs and sperms and also the preimplantation period, It should be remembered the use of these drugs can effect germ cells and since Imprinted genes are reprogrammed in germ cells they are passed on to future generations causing undesirable effects.</p>
