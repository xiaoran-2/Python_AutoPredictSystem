    <h1>Submission 168 from Anon (session_user_id: 761c3d9487ab10c4de9bd29a86e4fbaaa5ecd1d0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG islands are not methylated whereas in cancer cells they are methylated. Cancer is considered to be a combination of activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor supressor genes. This last one mentioned can be a consequence of the methylation of CpGs in tumor supressor gene promoters. As DNA methylation is mitotically heritable,  the diseased caused by this type of DNA methylation alteration are not parentally heritable. Also, these diseases can be cured because DNA methylation is reversible. For example, retinoblastoma is a diseased due to alteration in RB gene methylation. </p>
<p>On the other hand, normal and cancer cells also differ in intergenic and repetitive genes methylation. Normal cells have both of these genes methylated whereas cancer cells have them unmethylated. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs long term consequences are not taken into consideration because it's considered more important the survival of the patient. Although in young people germ cells need to be considered when drug treatment is delivered. Drugs alter DNA methylation, which can change the structure of the genome and thus the encoded proteins. In general, drugs act on enzymatic epigenetic regulators, for example chromatin remodelling,  methyltransferase inhibitor or even deacetylation of transcription factors. Sensitive period refers to a period of time in the development in which epigenetic  markers stablishing in the genome are more sensible to external changes. It's inadvisable to treat patients in sensitive periods because there's a higher probability of epigenetic markers errors happening.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug selled by a Japanese company that acts as a DNA demethylation agent. As the name tells, this drugs takes methyl group from the epigenome. It acts like an anti tumor drug because it demethylates cancer cells and restores normal function to the cell. This epigenetic change is passed on during cell division. </p></div>
