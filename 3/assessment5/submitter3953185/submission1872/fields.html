    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands results in silencing of gene expression and CpG islands are usually unmethylated. In intergenic regions and repetitive elements CpG islands are usually methylated. Repetitive elements and intergenic regions maintain genomic stability. When these regions are silenced transposition of genes is prevented. In cancer there is a genome-wide lack of methylation due to genomic instability. There can be deletions, reciprical translocations, insertions or deletions which lead to cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele has DNA methylation at ICR blocking binding of CTCF. DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter to silence this part of the gene and the enhancers further downstream are able to access and activate Igf2. On the maternal allele there is no DNA methylation, H19 is expressed and enhancers are not able to access Igf2 so Igf2 is silenced. In Wilm’s tumor the maternal H19/Igf2 cluster acts like the paternal. This disruption, which is due to an epigenetic loss of imprinting, results in two copies of the paternal allele and none of the maternal allele which in turn results in an upregulation of Igf2. This gene is known to be oncogenic so the growth of tumors is promoted. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a class of DNA demethylating agents. It inhibits a DNA methyltransferase resulting in hypomethylated DNA. In cancer sometimes tumor suppressor genes are turned off and therefore not able to do the job of suppressing tumors. A drug like Decitabine, by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases, could allow these tumor suppressor genes to stay on by inhibiting the machinery that is turning them off.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is passed down from parent to daughter cells. Altered methylation marks from these epigenetic drugs will be passed down to the daughter cells and then can make these cells more susceptible to other forms of treatment. I can use the tumor suppressor genes as an example from previous question. If a second cancer therapy agent is causing some kind of cell damage that doesn’t necessarily kill the cells or kill all of the cells, having a functioning tumor suppressor gene may force these cells to undergo apoptosis. Without a functioning tumor suppressor these cells may not die or may not die as quickly as needed to reduce the tumor.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are times when imprinted marks are being changed. These moments of imprinting are during fetal development. It would be advised that pregnant women not be treated as it would cause unwanted effects on their offspring or women should be advised not to get pregnant during treatment with these drugs.</p></div>
