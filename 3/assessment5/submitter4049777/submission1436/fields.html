    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Describe the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.</span> CpG-islands have higher amounts of CpG di-nucleotides, but in gerneral methylation does not occur (hypomethylation!); tend to be found at the promotors of genes. If CpG-islands are methylated (densely packed chromatin through binding of MeCP1/2), this is almost synonymous with silencing of gene expression. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.</span>  Global level of 5mC decreases (in genome-wide spread repetitive regions, CpG poor promotors and ICRs... loss of imprinting).  CpG-island methylation increases (locus specific hypermethylation in tumor suppressor genes (one of the hits in Knudson hypothetis) and ICRs... loss of imprinting) during the process from normal tissue to hyperplasia (disease) to neoplasia (cancer) and towards invasive tissue (metastases). <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Describe the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. </span>In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated (as well as introns in genes) so that the expression of these regions is nearly silenced by dense chromatin packing.  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Describe how DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.</span>  In cancer cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are in general not  methylated so that the expression of these regions may be increased.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The examples of the H19/Igf2 cluster has 2 featrures: It´s a paternal imprinting combined with enhancer blocking mechanism. </p>
<p>In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and CTCF (insulatorprotein) binds to it. This leads to insulation of the <em>Igf2</em> on the maternal chromosome and no expression. The more downstream lying enhancers have a preferred binding to <em>Igf2</em>, but  now act on their secondary preference: the <em>H19</em> promotor, leading to enhanced <em>H19</em> expression (via chromosome looping).</p>
<p>On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, so that CTCF can no longer bind to it. The methylation even spreads out to the <em>H19</em> promotor, which is then silenced (via heterochromatinspreading). This results in loss of the insulation of <em>Igf2</em>, which promotes the expression of <em>Igf2</em> from the paternal allel.</p>
<p>The Wilm´s tumor is one of the symptoms of Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome and caused by paternal uniparental disomy. The Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome goes along with two imprinted disorders in the linked <em>Kcnq1</em> and <em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster at 11q15.5 as these clusters are nearby. It is leading to loss of <em>Cdkn1c</em> (tumorsuppressorgene) and upregulation of <em>Igf2</em> (oncogene). So you don´t have growth suppressing signals, but strong growth promoting signals.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.  </span></p>
<p>DNA methyltransferase inhibitor</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation. </span></p>
<p>It is a hypomethylating agent.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.</span></p>
<p>Methyltransferases attach methyl groups to histone proteins, mainly H3 in humans. In case of EZH2 (3 methyl groups are bound in H3K27me), many lymphomas are caused by mutations that make EZH2 overactive leading to hypermethylation , what may induce silencing of expression of tumor suppressor genes due to more dense packing of chromatin. Using Decitabine as inhibitor for methyltransferases, this could provide a possibility to reastablish adequate degree of methylation in histones in tumor suppressing genes, preventing uncontrolled cell division.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome.</span>Altered DNA methylation patterns cause abnormal expression of cancer-associated genes. DNA hypomethylation activates oncogenes and initiates chromosome instability, whereas DNA hypermethylation initiates silencing of tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Define what is meant by a sensitive period. </span></p>
<p>It is a phase of epigenetic reprogamming, that can be influenced through the environment.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Identify sensitive periods of development.</span></p>
<p>Reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during gametogenesis, after fertilisation before implatation (blastocyte) or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.</span></p>
<p>Altered DNA methylation status can be inherited to daughter cells or even to the next generation via the gamets. This can go along with changes in genes that influence for example the development of cancer.</p></div>
