    <h1>Submission 984 from Anon (session_user_id: 0f4dea99a5e7871a5bf596ff2f1af0510bc5f891)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of DNA-demethylating agents which inhibit DNA methylation in genome, sold as Dacogen by a Japanese company. Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.<br />In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. Recently Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at C5 position of the cytosine base is found in about 70-80% of CpG dinucleotides in normal somatic mammalian cells and to some extend in non-CpG sequences in embryonic stem cells.<br />In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. The gene silencing then links to disease.<br />However normal promoter reions have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. <br />Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing.<br />The epigenome of cancer cells displays numerous alterations in comparison to the epigenome of their normal counterpart. Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic therapy attempts to change the behavior of cancer cells by blocking chemical changes to DNA, including DNA methylation that turns genes on or off.<br />The concept behind epigenetic treatment is to "reprogram" the network of chemical changes that affect the DNA of cancer cells.<br />Dr Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.<br />Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster is located on the imprinted gene region of human chromosome 11.Igf2 of the paternal allele is expressesd by DNA methylation at ICR blocks, but Igf2 of normal maternal allele is not expressed by methylation-free ICR block.<br />The protein CTCF is involved in repressing expression of the gene, by binding to the H19 imprinting control region (ICR). CTCF binding to H19 region limits downstream enhancer access to the Igf2 region.<br />In the case of LOI (loss of imprinting), the maternal allele is also expressed and Igf2 gene is overly expressed.<br />Overexpression of Igf2 gene can cause Wilm's tumour.</p>
