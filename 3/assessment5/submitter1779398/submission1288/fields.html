    <h1>Submission 1288 from Anon (session_user_id: cb958eb9f5f0312a7ff7d5f7716b8f68e6ac0353)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>How can drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment?</strong></p>
<p>It is known that DNA methylation, unlike genetics and its regulatory machinery, can be gradually erased replication after replication once this type of epigenetic drugs is being used, resulting in a permanent, increasing state of demethylation throughout subsequent cell generations. This can be explained by the fact that when <em>de novo</em> methylation after cell division does not occur or is blocked, subsequent generations will harbor methylation-free DNA copies.</p>
<p><strong>Define what is meant by a sensitive period</strong></p>
<p>A sensitive period is defined by the periods in the human lifespan, from the zygote to the adulthood, that are susceptible to epigenetic insults as a result of environmental or chemical interference.</p>
<p><strong>Identify sensitive periods of development</strong></p>
<p>Early embryonic stages (pre-implantation), and during pre-puberty, defined as being 8-10 y. old in women, and 10-12 in men.</p>
<p><strong>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable</strong></p>
<p>These types of treatments, during these so-called sensitive periods, would eventually interfere with the active <em>de novo</em> methylation taking place in the zygote, or in the germ cell line in pre-puberty and cause disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation state in cancer is characterized by i) hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, contributing to genomic instability and ii) hypermetilation of CpG islands (CGI) generally located at promoters, namely those involved in the activation of tumour supressor genes.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is generally involved in <em>cis</em> gene silencing.</p>
<p>In cancer, DNA methylation of CpG islands is often disrupted by several possible causes - point mutations at CGIs, mutations that alter the function of enzymes that lay down epigenetic marks (e.g. DNMTs), and many other factors that act both directly and indirectly in these changes, such as transcription factors, repressive protein complexes, chromatin remodelling proteins, etc.</p>
<p>This disruption, in other words the hypermethylation of CGIs of promoters, will eventually lead to the silencing of tumour supressor genes that are responsible for control and reduction of cell proliferation. In this case, the lack of these protein-coding transcripts will enable the cell to divide indefinately, thus forming a tumour.</p>
<p>i) the unmethylated intergenic regions, being responsible for appropriate transcription of flanking genes once methylated, will then alter the transcriptional activity of these genes and inclusively activate those whose expression is unexpected, ii) the unmethylated repetitive elements, normally methylated to prevent genomic sequences and chromossomic structures from suffering instability and ultimately recombination, will lead to severe malfunctions and possibly normal ploidy deviations after replicating into new daughter cells. Here, the disruption is caused by the very same phenomena described above.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The disruption of the paternal imprinting will often result in a inappropriate protein dosage which, depending on its function, can cause disease.</p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is a outstanding example. This cluster is composed by i) H19, paternally imprinted, that encodes a regulatory protein, and ii) Igf2, maternally imprinted, that encodes a growth factor that promotes cell division. In other words,</p>
<ul><li>In the paternally inherited cluster, H19 is not expressed, Igf2 is;</li>
<li>In the maternally inherited cluster, H19 is expressed, but Igf2 is not.</li>
</ul><p>The combination of these in a given child will result in a normal metabolic function.</p>
<p>However, when any of these imprinting marks are disrupted, it will cause proteins to have abnormal expression, either higher or lower.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour was recently found to be caused by the abormal active transcription by the maternal Igf2 gene, which as was stated before, should be silenced. If the paternal Igf2 gene holds it normal state of activation, this will result in the double dosage of Igf2. Knowing that Igf2 promotes cell division, therefore one could easily associate this protein excess to the abnormal, active cell division in this type of tumour. CTCF, and insulator protein, is directly involved.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNMT inhibitors class. These nucleoside analogues irreversibly bind to DNMTs and thus deplete their activity. Such mechanism of action is dependent upon replication.</p>
<p>Its anti-tumour effect is due to its downstream effect, the absence of DNA methylation in the subsequent daughter cells' DNA given the absence of free DNMT to lay down methyl groups to the <em>de novo</em> synthesized DNA.</p></div>
