    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation plays one of the key roles in epigenetic regulation of genes thus making cells with the same genes function in variety of ways.DNA methylation at CpG islands present in promoter of genes switches the genes off. In normal cells most of these CpG islands are free of methylation.     </p>
<p> But that isn’t the case in cancer cells. In fact, the degree of these CpG island methylation increases with time and severity of the disease. Important genes like those of regulatory function and tumor suppressor genes have their promoter hypermethylated thus silencing the genes in cancer cells</p>
<p>   DNA methylation is also found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This helps in maintaining the integrity of the genome by preventing mutation like deletions, recombination and duplication to occur due to the activity of transposons. In cancer, there is genome wide hypomethylation which causes mutations like the ones above mentioned. Transposons may interrupt the genes and silence them. Lack of methylation in repetitive elements or transposons may also cause aberrant expression of genes due to addition of strong promoters causing upregulation of the gene. Mutation, silencing and aberrant expressions may cause the expression of totally different set of genes and lead to diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Imprinted H19/Igf2 cluster have the H19 maternally expressed and Igf2 paternally expressed. This is achieved by methylation of H19/Igf2 cluster’s ICR in the paternal allele. Because of methylation at the ICR, the enhancers bind to Igf2 and the gene is expressed paternally.</p>
<p>     In case of maternal allele, ICR is not methylated. So now the ICR is free for CTCF to bind which is an insulator protein. Presence of CTCF blocks the enhancer from binding with Igf2. Instead, the enhancers now bind to H19 and express H19.</p>
<p>   Specific hypermethylation which is a characteristic of cancer genome affects the cluster and results in loss of imprinting. Hypermethylation at maternal ICR makes it function like the paternal allele thus upregulating Igf2 and silencing H19 in the cases of Wilm’s tumor. Igf2 being growth promoter. Double dose of it promotes tumor growth and contribute to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine are DNMT inhibitors. They work by getting incorporated in DNA while its division. When the DNMTs come to methylate the new strand, DNMTi bind irreversibly to DNMTs and do not let it methylate the DNA. Thus, Decitabine decrease methylation.</p>
<p>      The effect of Decitabine depends on the division. As the cancer cell divides rapidly, they are the ones who are majorly affected by the drug. Hypermethylation is diluted with divisions leading to activation of tumour suppressor genes and slowing tumor growth and hence, treatment of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark. Altered DNA methylation through drug may have prolonged effect because of its heritable nature. However, there are periods in lifetime of an individual when such drugs should be avoided. They are the periods of epigenetic reprogramming called sensitive periods. The epigenetic marks which differentiate the cells in different tissue types are very stable in nature throughout most of the lifetime. But, the period after fertilization during embryonic development and the period of primordial germ cell development face reprogramming of these epigenetic marks. These periods are the sensitive periods.  Any changes in epigenetic mark at the sensitive period of the individual’s lifetime or its next generation lifetime have adverse effect and have lifelong consequences. Methylation at the sensitive time periods may also disruption imprinted genes and cause diseases.</p></div>
