<p>     The provided figure compares the methylation state of the genome in a Normal cell vs. a Cancer cell.  In a normal cell, CpG islands are hypo-methylated (empty circles), whereas the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hyper-methylated (shaded circles).  Conversely, the opposite is true in a cancer cell, where CpG islands are hyper-methylated, and intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypo-methylated.<br /><br />     Methylation at CpG islands corresponds to silencing of gene expression.  Therefore, hypo-methylation of CpG islands in normal cells equates to active transcription of the gene.  Subsequent hyper-methylation would silence the gene.  In the case of tumor-suppressor genes, this silencing can contribute to the progression of cancer in the cell.  In fact, hyper-methylation of CpG islands in cancer cells is often more frequent than mutations that inactivate the gene.<br /><br />     In normal cells, hyper-methylation within intergenic regions acts to silence cryptic promoters and cryptic splice sites.  Whereas, hyper-methylation of repetitive elements acts to silence potential transposable elements.  Repetitive elements also contain strong promoters that must be silenced to avoid transcriptional interference.  Methylation of repeats may also prevent illegitimate recombination between non-homologous chromosomes.</p>
<p>     In all, hyper-methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements maintain genomic integrity.  Loss of methylation in cancer cells at intergenic regions and repetitive elements results in abnormal karyotypes represented by insertions, deletions, and reciprocal translocations.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>

<p>     Figure 1 depicts the differential methylation at the imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster in a normal cell.  This cluster is paternally-imprinted, that is, the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated (shaded oval).  Consequently, the ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated (empty oval).<br /><br />     The unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele allows binding of the protein, CTCF, which insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers.  Alternatively, H19 expression is enhanced.  Conversely, methylation of the ICR on the paternal allele blocks CTCF binding, allowing access of Igf2 by the enhancers.  Furthermore, DNA methylation spreads from the ICR into the H19 promoter, silencing the gene.</p>

<p>     Figure 2 depicts the abhorrent methylation in Wilm’s tumor.  In these cells, both the paternal and maternal ICRs are methylated.  This results in the upregulation of Igf2, a growth-promoting gene (i.e., oncogene), which contributes to the formation of the tumor.<br /><br />     In general, alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo- or hyper-methylation), can result in the loss of expression of growth-restricting genes, or overexpression of growth-promoting genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-24460766c9ebad0555462742/970238/asst-5/970238-520d3c858982f9.72626741.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>     Decitabine is a cytosine-analog, which is converted intracellularly to a triphosphate and incorporated into replicating DNA. (Cancer cells replicate at a faster rate than normal cells.)  The modification at position 5 of the pyrimidine ring inhibits DNA methylation by DNA methyltransferase.  Decitabine is, therefore, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).<br /><br />     Decitabine is a FDA-approved drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  AML is characterized by DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands within the promotor regions of tumor suppressor genes, which results in undesirable gene silencing.  Inhibition of this methylation, which is mitotically heritable, can restore the activity of these tumor auppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>     DNA methylation is responsible for regulation of gene activity and genomic integrity.  Therefore, alterations in these epigenetic marks can lead to inappropriate gene activation or silencing, as well as, loss of genomic integrity.  Given that the epigenome is mitotically heritable, these defects can be passed on to subsequent daughter cells.<br /><br />     DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) have been developed to combat the effects of hyper-methylation at CpG island promoters, which leads to inappropriate silencing of gene expression.  However, caution should be taken for patients undergoing periods of epigenetic reprogramming.  These sensitive periods occur during gametogenesis and after fertilization.  <br /><br />     Treatment of a patient undergoing gametogenesis could interfere with primordial germ cell (PGC) epigenetic clearing and resetting, potentially affecting their progeny.  Large scale epigenetic reprogramming also occurs after fertilization, therefore, treatment is ill-advised for pregnant women, or women who might become pregnant.</p></div>
