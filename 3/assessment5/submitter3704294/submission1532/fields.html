    <h1>Submission 1532 from Anon (session_user_id: 5a64dc9e5bddaec596fb21380ab5ee932634d5f9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><strong>Decitabine is a DNA-methylation inhibitor or DNA-demethylating agent.</strong></li>
<li><strong>It inhibit the DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.                                                                                 </strong></li>
<li><strong>DNA methylation silences the gens, including tumour supressing gen , Decitabine has DNA-demethylating property so its help in transcription of tumour supressing gen by not silencing them .After transcription and translation tumour supressing gens produce protein which has anti-tumour property .so we can say Decitabine has anti-tumour effect.</strong></li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><strong><strong>DNA methylation at CpG island silences the gens. In normal cell CpG islands are hypomethylated . </strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>In cancer cell DNA hypermethylation takes place  on the palce of hypomethylation at CpG island. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Due to hypermethylation of CpG island, silencing of gens takes place such as silencing of tumor suppressor gens , which led to growth of tumor and ultimately cancer.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain ''hypermethylated pericentromeric heterochromatin'' which prevent cell from mitotic recombination and genomic instability .</strong></li>
<li><strong>In cancer cell hypomethylation takes palce on the palce of hypermethylation  in  intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Due to disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements hypomethylation takes place which led to genetic instability. Genetic instability includes conversion of heterochromatin into euchromatin and formation of  illegitamet recombination between the repeats , activation of repeats and traspostion ,distruption of neighbouring gens etc. for example mutation in DNMT3B result in ICF it is a result of genetic instability</strong></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<ul><li><strong>Imprinting is an epigenetic process that involves DNAmethylation and histone modulation  to get monoallelic gene expression. In H19/Igf2 cluster, on parental allele (ICR)imprinting control region are methylated so, it can't bind with insulator protein- CTCF .As a result Igf2 is not insulated and enhancers act on Igf2 and enhance its expression .Due to DNA methylation spreading H19 is silenced . Therefore Igf2 express form parental allele.</strong></li>
<li><strong>On maternal allele (ICR) unmethylated so insulator protein-CTCF bind to it and insulate Igf2 . As the result enhancer can no longer acton Igf2 but can act on secondary center H19 . therefore is maternally expreeed but Jgf2 cant expressed by maternal allele</strong></li>
<li><strong>In Wilm's tumour imprinting disrupted due to maternal allele behaives like parental allele, Igf2 expression increases , deletion to  cause imprinting , uniparental disomy etc.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Disruption in imprinting of H19/Igf2 cluster can led to upregulation of Igf2 which has oncogenic property which can cause tumour or cancee , example is Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome.Loss of DNAmethylation at (ICR) imprinting control center is common cause of cancer, because both parental and maternal allele expresses Igf2 . </strong></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<ul><li><strong>DNAmethylation is epigenetic change which can passed from one generation to other until they are actively erased. DNAmethylation is important for DNA imprinting , x-inactivation and cell diffrentiation etc. so the drug that ulter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment  .</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sensitive period is the period, which is more prone to genetic mutation . In this period euchromatin percentage increase and and hetrochromatin decreases</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enbryonic period is one of  sensitive period of development . </strong></li>
<li><strong>Treating patients during sensitive period increase the risk of genomic mutation , which can inherit from generation to generation .</strong></li>
