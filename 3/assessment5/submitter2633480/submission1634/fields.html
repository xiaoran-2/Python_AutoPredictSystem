    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG island are usually unmethylated that allows the nearby genes to be expressed whereas one of the hallmarks of cancer cells is intense methylation of CpG islands. The problems is that methylation of CpG islands leads to silencing of the following located genes and often those genes are tumor suppressive ones as they constrain cell growth. (However, often methylation of CpG islands is not sufficient for the development of cancer as there are many tumor suppressive genes can still be expressed nicely in the cell and oncogenes that engender cell growth are turned off. Thus, we need numerous disruptions of epigentics marks to end up with cancer.)</p>
<p>Also, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells predominantly are turned off by methylation in contrast to cancer cells. Activation of repetitive elements is linked to numerous DNA mutations, deletions, translocations and overall genome instability that in its turn contribute to cancer because of disruption of oncogenes and tumor-supressor genes' expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On maternal allele lgf2 gene is not expressed and H19 gene is expresses as enhancers that located near these genes can freely bind to H19 gene and CTCF protein that is connected to unmethylated region between considered genes. However, on paternal allele this region and beginnig of H19 gene are methylated, thus enhancers bind to lgf2 gene striking its expression. lfg2 is an oncogene as it promotes  cell growth, thus in Wilm's tumour when H19 and specific protein that binds CTCF are methylated on maternal allele, we end up with two lgf2 expressed genes instead of one. This means that we have overexpression of lfg2 oncogene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor that demethylates DNA. It can act in several ways. One of the ways is to inactivate or block the proteins that transpher methyl groups and attach them to the DNA. So heavy methylation of CpG islands will be substantially reduced that will allow expression of tumor-supressor genes again. Also Decitabine can act on genes controlling production of these transpher proteins or the proteins that copy pattern of DNA methylation when the cell divides.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is known that the pattern of DNA methylation in a cell is inherited in somatic cells. There are specific proteins that methylate the DNA when it doubles and as a result the cells after division are epigentically identical that ensure the same functions and belonging to certain cell type. Thus, if in the case of treating cancer we change this pattern of methylation, the altered pattern is preserved in the next generations of these cells that provide lasting effect. As more of the cells become normal and stop such intensive division they can be easily destroyed by chemotherapy and replenishment of the cell becomes not fast. Also, some genes that had been unexpressed become active and can produce proteins that are needed for procesing of chemo agents.</p>
<p>Overall, sensitive periods is time when establishment or erase of epigenetic marks is occuring. For example, in preimpantation period and during primordial germ cell development. It is inavisable to treat patients during these periods as not all or in wrong way necessary epigenetic marks can be erased or established. Thus it is better to restrain from using such drugs in pregnant women and not grown up male and female when their germ cells are still in development.</p></div>
