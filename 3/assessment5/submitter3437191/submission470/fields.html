    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;">DNA methylation is essential for normal development and is basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, suppression of repetitive elements, and carcinogenesis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;">In normal cells, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;">CpG islands in the promotor region of genes are unmethylated which leads to active gene expression but introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements were methylated. So the gene activation is switched off by methylation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;">In cancer cells, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;">CpG islands in the promotor region of genes are methylated and its leads to inactivation of gene but introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements were unmethylated which activates the gene expression and leads to different disease such as cancer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;">Tumor suppressor genes hypermethylation leads to tumor formation. High frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites was first identified in colorectal cancer. CpG island methylator phenotype can also be found in other tumor entities such as glioma or breast cancer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;">Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;">Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated which leads to genomic instability. Unmethylation may also leads to lost of imprinted gene and deregulation of tissue specific genes<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;">Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as an important component of cancer development.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:

        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;">Genomic imprinting is an<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';"> epigenetic process</span> that involves DNA methylation<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';"> </span>and<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';"> histone methylation </span>in order to achieve monoallelic</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;">gene expression without altering the genetic sequence.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;">IGF-2 gene is maternally imprinted, which means gene inherited from the mother is methylated and gene is inactive and paternally IGF-2 gene is non imprinted, which means gene inherited from father is unmethylated, which leads active gene expression.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;"><br /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;">Decitabine belongs to DNA demethylation epigenetic inhibitors. It is </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;">used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. <span style="color:#333333;">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Its nucleoside analogues, irreversibly binds to DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) after they are incorporated into DNA and stop further action of  <span>DNMT. </span></span></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;line-height:21px;">Tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. If this is gene is methylated which leads to tumorigenesis. Decitabine inhibit the DNA methyl transferase enzyme, which involved in methylation of DNA in tumour-suppressor genes, once the gene unmethylation that turn on the tumour suppressor gene expression. So decitabine used as anti tumour drug in epigenetic therapies.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#4a4a4a;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;"><br /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#4a4a4a;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;">Alternation of DNA methylation by epigenetic therapies is passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they actively erased. Once they erased, they do not return. So </span><span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:large;">DNA methylations have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment. Period in which addition and removal of epigenetic mark between the generation is called sensitive period.  Pre -implantation period and primordial germ cell development are identified as sensitive period. During this period epigenetic reprogramming which take place. Demethylation and methylation will take place which necessary for important normal process like X activation, parental imprinting and maintaining genomic stability. During this period treating with epigenetic drugs are inadvisable because it disturbs the normal epigenetic reprogramming.  </span></p></div>
