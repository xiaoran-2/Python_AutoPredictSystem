    <div class="field-value"><p>Q1: The typical observation made in normal (non-cancerous) cells is to exhibit high levels of global DNA methylation, with low levels of CpG (Cytosine, Guanine-rich) island methylation (specific sites). CpG islands are found throughout the genome with most CpG islands in normal tissues unmethylated. DNA methylation of CpG islands can decrease mRNA transcription (expression) by reducing transcription factor binding (access) and binding MeCP1/2 proteins to form repressive chromatin structures. This can happen in normal cells of different tissue types and can be observed in cases of X-chromosome inactivation.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer, with global DNA hypomethylation observed (decreasing overall), and CpG island hypermethylation.  DNA methylation at CpG islands and the surrounding chromosomal regions (CpG island shores, +/- 2kb) can result in downregulation of tumor suppressors, such as GSTP1, MLH1, RB, MGMT, and BRCA1, which may lead to uncontrolled cell growth - the hallmark of cancer (uncontrolled growth in prostate, colon, retina, glia and breast cells).</p>
<p>DNA methylation in integenic regions and repetitive elements (global DNA methylation) prevents illegitimate recombination between chromosomes, improving genomic stability and may be responsible for maintaining tissue differentation phenotypes. DNA hypomethylation is observed in cancer (low levels of DNA methylation) either by removal of DNA methyl groups or removal/downregulation of enzymes that maintain DNA methylation following mitosis (DNMT1).  Loss of DNA methylation in intergenic regions can lead to reciprocal translocations (illegitimate recombination), activation of cryptic promoters, and increased genomic instability.  For example, hypomethylation of CpG-poor promoters can result in the activation of oncogenes, such as RAS and PTEN, due to increased access by transcription factors - which have now been observed in some cancers (gastric, glioma).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Q2: Imprint control regions (ICR) are regions of the genome/DNA that can be methylated or "imprinted" to regulate or control expression.  This may facilitate parent of origin expression in specific tissues, such as maternal expression of the X chromosome in extra-embryonic tissues (placenta), with corresponding paternal X chromosome inactivation.  ICRs may also be regulated for dosage compensation, as with the example of the H19/Igf2 ICR locus.  This locus is methylated on the paternal allele, allowing the neighboring H19 promoter to also be methylated - resulting in gene silencing.  This paternal allele methylation thus allows for the downstream enhancers to activate Igf2 on the paternal (but not maternal) chromosome.  The H19/Igf2 ICR locus is unmethylated on the maternal allele, allowing the enhancers to express H19 (which remains unmethylated at the promoter site), but not Igf2 from the maternal (but not paternal) chromosome.</p>
<p>In some cancers, such as Wilm's tumor, hypermethylation can be observed.  This cgenetic or epigenetic modification to DNA methylation enzymes, results in inappropriate maternal chromosome DNA methylation.  Both alleles (maternal, paternal chromosomes) exhibit DNA methylation at this locus, resulting in H19 promoter methylation (downregulation ) and enhanced expression of Igf2 (upregulation), precipitating abnormal cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Q3: Decitabine (Dacogen) is a DNA demethylating agent made by a Japanese firm Eisai to treat myelodysplasia, a precursor to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This drug belongs to class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) that are nucleoside analogs, are incorporated into replicating DNA (cancerous, precancerous cells) and bind irreversibly to DNMTs. This results in a daughter cell without the functional epigenetic DNA methylation marks on tumor supressor genes, and since these marks are chemically "erased" - they do not return. This means rapidly dividing cells (cancers, precancers) will incorporate this drug, bind their DNMTs and produce daughter cells without DNA methylation marks on their tumor suppressors.  This functional, chemically-induced modification can result in the return of tumor suppressor gene expression and the return of proper, normal cell-cycle regulation and the removal of uncontrolled cell growth phenotypes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr. Baylin suggested epigenetic drug effects have lasting effects that alter chemotherapeutic sensitivity because alterations to DNA methylation (epigenetic modifications) are mitotically heritable (meaning once erased they last into the daughter cells once the cell divides).  This suggests that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors can stop DNA sites, such as tumor suppressors, from being methylated on the newly synthesized daughter strand of DNA in a replicating cell.  If these drugs are still present, the hemi-methylated DNA will further dilute after the next replication - resulting in fewer and fewer cells with DNA methylation of the tumor suppressors, which may alter or enhance the cellular response to chemotherapies. </p>
<p>Younger patients (before or during the child-bearing years) may experience alterations to germ cells, which require DNA methylation for proper development. In addition, pregnant women (with a developing fetus) will require DNA methylation for placental growth and proper fetal development.  These situations (youth, pregnancy) could be considered sensitive periods of development, when the absence of DNA methylation could have serious and detrimental effects. </p>
<p>Treatment of patients during sensitive periods (pregnancy, early and child-bearing years) may be another consideration to help decide what types of therapy are appropriate, including DNA methylation inhibitors.</p></div>
