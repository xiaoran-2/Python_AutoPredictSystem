    <h1>Submission 930 from Anon (session_user_id: 3a65ef273d11220cc8a595dad56b8789f8bc9c02)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In DNA majority of CpG dinucleotides are methylated, with exception of CpG islands, which are normally not methylated. CpG island are found in promoters of most genes.</p>
<p>In cancer cells CpG islands are often hypermethylated, which leads to silencing of corresponding genes, including tumor suppressing genes.</p>
<p>CpG dinucleotides in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated, but in cancer they are hypomethylated.</p>
<p>Hypometylation of intergenic regions and repeats in cancer cells leads to genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells maternal allele is not methylated and paternal allele is methylated (imprinting). As a result maternal allele has active H19 and inactive Igf2 and paternal allele has inactive H19 and active Igf2.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor both alleles get methylated which leads to silencing H19 gene and activation of Igf2 on maternal allele. It results in overexpression of growth promoting Igf2 and loss of expression of growth restricting H19.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. Its effect reduces hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer cells which in turn reduces inactivation of tumor-suppressing genes. As a result, growth of cancer cells is suppressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs alter DNA methylation pattern which is mitotically inheritable, so that methylation pattern will last unless epigenetic reprogramming will clear it.<br /> Sensitive period is when epigenetic reprogramming takes place.<br /> There are two sensitive periods in humans (and other mammals) – during preimplantation period of embryonic development and during primordial germ cells development.<br /> Using epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods could disrupt epigenetic reprogramming and could result in epigenetic abnormalities which would be mitotically inheritable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, environmental stress, including chemotherapy, can also disrupt epigenetic reprogramming during sensitive periods.</p></div>
