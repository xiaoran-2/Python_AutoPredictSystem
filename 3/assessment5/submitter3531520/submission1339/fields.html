    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation occurs at CpG islands and maintained through cell division. In contrast to the bulk of genomic DNA, in which most CpG sites are heavily methylated, CpG islands in germ-line tissue and promoters of normal somatic cells remain unmethylated, allowing gene expression to occur. Thus, CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation. </p>
<p>CpG islands hypermethylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer. Tumor suppressor genes and those encoding cell growth-regulatory proteins are often silenced in hematopoietic malignancies by DNA hypermethylation. Promoter hypermethylation can therefore constitute the initial hit in many somatic cancers, with subsequent mutations or deletions eliminating the second gene copy. </p>
<p>CGIs hypermethylation has distinguishing features. First, tumour suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutations. Secondly, identity of hypermethylation CGIs varies by tumour type. Thirdly, CGIs methylation progresses with time, but cofounded by DNA-methylation alterations with age.Hypermethylation increases with tumorigenicity, for example, in MDS and lung cancer high level of methylation correlate with poor prognosis.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements usually methylated. DNA methylation maintains genomic integrity, because it takes part in silencing of repeats to prevent transposition and avoiding transcriptional interference from strong promoters. Also, methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation in CpG poor promoters is less common event, than hypomethylation of repeats.Consequence of hypomethylation depends on location, for example, in CpG poor promoter it leads to oncogene activation, such as <em>R-RAS</em> in gastric cancer and <em>miR21</em> in glioma. In contrast, hypomethylation in repeats/ intergenic regions leads to genomic instability.</p>
<p>Different tumours have different dependencies: driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation, then depletion of DNA methylation appears to suppress tumorigenesis. In contrast, driven by chromosomal instability, then depletion of DNA methylation appears to enhance tumorigenesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Paternal allele contains activated <em>Igf2</em> and methylated <em>H19</em> promoter. Without CTCF (insulator factor), DNA methylation spreads to <em>H19</em> promoter to silence and enhancers can access <em>Igf2</em> to activate. Thus, there is only one copy of <em>Icf2</em> gene.    </p>
<p>Maternal allele contains inactive <em>Igf2</em> and unmethylated <em>H19</em> promoter. CTCF (insulator factor) insulates <em>Igf2</em> from downstream enhancers. Thus, there are no copies of <em>Icf2</em> gene in maternal allele. DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF.    </p>
<p>Prader-Willi syndrome commonly caused by deletion or inappropriate silencing of the paternal copy of 15q11-13. This results into no expression of paternally expressed genes within this cluster (snoRNAs have a role in determining brain phenotype). In contrast, deletion of PWS-IC leads to maternal-like allele (<em>Snrpn/Snrpn </em>start site removed).</p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes. This is early event, often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue. Hypermethylation of ICR and <em>Igf2</em> overexpression observed in Wilm’s tumour, because there are two copies of <em>Igf2</em> (from maternal and paternal alleles).   </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Overactivity of EZH2 leads to methylation of histones more than they should be and thus silences the genes they surround, including so-called tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It functions in a similar manner to azacitidine, although decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains.</p>
<p>Decitabine  reduces the proliferation of tumour cells while, crucially, having no apparent effect on nearby normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands.</p>
<p>Unusually high frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites was termed CIMP (for CpG island methylator phenotype). CIMP is associated with diverse clinicopathological characteristics such as patient age, gender, tumor location, microsatellite instability.</p>
<p>Another target of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer are CpG island shores, approximately 2 kb regions surrounding CpG islands. Methylation of shore regions is related to gene expression and has also been detected in different tumor cell lines.</p>
<p>Stochastic methylation variability was detected in cancer specific differentially methylated regions (cDMRs), which might contribute to tumor heterogeneity. Further, large hypervariable blocks covering half the genome show differences in gene expression patterns, involving genes that regulate tumor-associated processes such as cell division and matrix remodeling.</p>
<p>Sensitive period - is critical perod, when epgenetic marks are established rather, than maintained. Sensitive periods occures, when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control, such as early development and PCG development.</p>
