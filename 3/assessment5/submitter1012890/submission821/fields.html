    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>DNA methylation at CpG islands</li>
</ol><p>CpG islands  are in the  promoters of tumor suppressor genes.  In a normal cell we see hypomethylation at CpG islands.</p>
<p>At a cancer cell, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated though not all  methylated. In general, tumour suppressor hypermethylation is more frequent than genetic mutation at a cancer cell. It has been found in essentially all tumors that have ever been studied. Hypermethylation of specific CpG islands ( CGIs ) varies by tumor type, and methylation progresses with time.</p>
<p>With CpG island hypermethylation, a cancer cell is able to  silence tumor suppressor genes by locking in acyl  in active state.  According to Knudson hypothesis, cancer is the result of accumulated mutations to a cell's DNA. (1)  CpG island hypermethylation  might be one of the hits that contribute to disease.</p>
<p>2. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  </p>
<p>The genome in general is methylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic</p>
<p>stability.</p>
<p>At a cancer cell, those intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.  Genome-wide hypomethylation  is  very common in tumors .It occurs early and progresses with  time. The hypomethylation causes many changes, such as losing or gaining chromosomes , or having illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes when they shouldn't happen, or insertion / additional deletions .</p>
<p>These changes happen because the DNA is  not densely packaged due to hypomethylation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and adjacent  H19 imprinted genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin manner.  They are under the control of imprinting control regions (ICRs), which are themselves differentially methylated between maternal and paternal alleles .An ICR contains multiple binding sites for the insulator protein CTCF which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated. and allows binding of CTCF which blocks transcription of IGF2 for the maternal allele and activates H19, in turn inhibiting growth</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated and CTCF is not  binding to intulate Igf2 .Therefore enhancers can access can access IGF2 to  activate from the pattern and silences H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype. The H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated,  IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, results in biallelic expression of IGF2 causing increased cell growth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine  is DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes(1). It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase(DNMTs) ) in an irreversible, covalent manner.  As a consequence, genes previously silenced by DNA hypermethylation can be re-expressed upon treating cancer cells.(2) This  is believed to contribute to the anti-tumour effect of Decitabine .</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are two critical developmental stages in which the epigenome undergoes extensive reprogramming: Primordial germ cells and Preimplantation and postimplantation periods. Those periods are called sensitive periods. During those times, epigenetic marks are erased and then reestablished. There is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms.</p></div>
