    <div class="field-value"><div>CpG dinucleotides are symmetrical. They are mostly found at promoter regions. If CpG is unmethylated/hypomethylated – gene is active (general rule); if CpG is methylated, transcription does not start - gene is silent. CpG islands throughout the genome are generally hypomethylated.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In cancer:</div>
<p>general methylation is going down, locus-specific CpG island methylation is going up affecting histone modification;</p>
<p>hypermethylation at CpG regions surrounding CpG islands (shores) 2 kb upstream of downstream of tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>As cancer progresses we get increase in methylation of the CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. Hypermethylation can lead to similar consequences as mutation. Specific genes may become hypermethylated in case of metastasis  i.e. hypermethylation of marker RNA gene miR-34b/c. </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements make up most part of the genome. In normal cells they are as a rule, methylated and tightly packed on histones. piRNAs are normally silencing repeats.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in every tumor on very early stage of cancer development become hypomethylated and lose heterochromatine qualities. piRNAs and long non-coding RNA expression is deregulated in cancer.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of repetitive element and loss of heterochromatization due to histone modification become more widespread with time and brings about genomic instability due to deletions, insertions or translocations in the paces where none of this should happen:</p>
<ol start="1"><li> 
</li><li>illegitimate  recombination b/w repeats on 2 different chromosomes resulting in reciprocal translocation of regions that normally would not be subject to recombination.
 
</li><li>hypomethylated repeats  can also become activated – make a copy of themselves and transpose.  While doing so can disrupt expression the gene       they jumped to or activate the gene that was previously inactive creating deletions or insertions.</li>
</ol><p> Intergenic regions (introns) often contain promoters and enhancers. In cancer CpG-poor promoters become hypomethylated and this can activate oncogene expression or expression of factors that will deactivate tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p> Long non-coding RNA in cancer is silencing tumor suppressor gene.</p>
<p> Generally change in intergenic and repetitive elements can alter nuclear architecture.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At H19/Igf2 cluster, ICR (imprint control region) is <strong>methylated</strong> on <strong>paternal </strong>allele. CTCF (insulator protein) can not bind to ICR. This allows enhancers to promote <strong>expression of Igf2</strong> gene, while H19 is not expressed.</p>
<p>At H19/Igf2 cluster, ICR (imprint control region) is <strong>unmethylated </strong>on <strong>maternal</strong> allele. CTCF can bind to unmethylated ICR and allow enhancers to promote <strong>expression of H19</strong> gene, while silencing Igf2. </p>
<p>With loss of unmethylated ICR from maternal allele (hypermethylation of ICR mechanism) H19 is no longer expressed, but Igf2 is now expressed from maternal and paternal alleles.</p>
<p>In normal cells only one allele (from one parent) of the gene is expressed, the other one (from another parent) is imprinted, in this case by binding of CTCF insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from being acted upon by enhancers and expressed.Genesthat are imprinted often are involved in growth. Cancer cells lose imprinting. As result, in case of H19/Igf2 cluster – imprinting is lost due to ICR (imprint control region) hypermethylation, double dose of growth promoting gene Igf2 (oncogene) is present and leads to growth of the tumor in the kidney.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNMTi – DNA methyl transferase inhibitors (acts against DNA methyl transferases)</p>
<p>Decitabine is nucleoside analogue. It gets incorporated into DNA upon replication. When  DNA methyl transferase comes along to bind nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyl transferase is bound irreversibly and can no longer be released. </p>
<p>Action is division-dependent. Drug acts on rapidly dividing tumor cells much more than on normal cells.  Drug causes DNA demethylation and possibly has other effects as well.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is important for normal epigenetic mechanisms to take place. If enzymes that methylate daughter DNA strands are missing from particular tissues or organs, those tissues/organs are getting cancer.</p>
<p>Periods with epigenetic reprogramming are considered sensitive.</p>
<p>Development of the germ cells are sensetive periods; period after egg fertilasation is sensitive up to the blastocust stage. Early embryonic development is sensitive</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive period with cancer drugs will potentially target every cell. Young patients should not take drugs that inhibit epiginitic machinery.</p>
