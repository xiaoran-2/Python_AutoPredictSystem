    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting of a gene cluster dictates that only one of two alleles derived from either the maternal or the paternal cluster will be expressed. Expression of the allele from both the maternal and the paternal cluster as a result of loss of imprinting may promote cell replication and formation of tumors due to overproduction of a particular gene product.</p>
<p>Normally the DNA of the imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 <strong>paternal</strong> cluster is methylated and is unable to bind CTCF. Methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, shutting down H19 transcription and allowing enhancers to promote expression of Igf2. In the <strong>maternal</strong> cluster the ICR is not methylated and CTCF is able to bind the ICR insulating the cluster from enhancement of Igf2 expression while enhancing the transcription of H19.</p>
<p>Wilm’s tumor occurs when the maternal cluster ICR is hypermethylated preventing the binding of CTCF. The maternal cluster then acts like the paternal cluster and overproduction of Igf2 occurs. The imbalance of Igf2 expression promotes the uncontrolled growth of cells found in Wilm's tumor. </p>
<p class="p1">Beckwith Widemann syndrome occurs when an imprinting defect leading to the loss of Cdkn1c expression is coupled to the overproduction of Igf2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, inhibits the methylation of cytosines, affecting the transfer of the cytosine methylation pattern from the parent to the daughter strand during DNA replication. Inhibition of DNA methylation has the potential to activate epigenetically silenced genes.</p>
<p>Many cancers such as colorectal cancer are associated with hypermethylation at CIMPs and CpG island shores. CpG islands in the promoters of normally expressed genes are usually not methylated and increased methylation has the potential to shut off expression of genes such as tumor suppressors. </p>
<p>Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressors by hypermethylation, creates an imbalance between the expression of tumor promoting genes and tumor suppressing genes. The silencing of tumor suppressors is propagated through mitosis by of DNA methyltransferases. Inhibition of the DNA methyltransferases by decitabine could reduce the hypermethylation of the promoters of tumor suppressors, potentially restoring the balance between tumor suppressor and tumor promoter gene expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation maintains gene expression patterns and genomic stability and is mitotically heritable. Any perturbation can lead to the alteration of the epigenome with enduring effects during the lifetime of the individual and future generations.</p>
<p>Azacytidine inhibits DNA methylation, preventing the transmission of DNA methylation patterns during DNA replication. Azacytidine helps to eliminate aberrant methylation patterns that might be present in cancer cells. Use of these drugs beyond the period of cancer treatment, especially during sensitive periods when the epigenome undergoes reprogramming, could have unexpected consequences.</p>
<p>During sensitive periods epigenetic marks are cleared and reset. This occurs during the formation of primordial germ cells (PGCs), during embryonic development before implantation and during organ formation. In PGCs, epigenetic marks are removed and epigenetic signatures specific to sperm or oocytes are laid down. During embryonic development, DNA methylation marks are removed and reestablished before implantation. During organ formation epigenetic marks are changed in order to establish specific cell types.</p>
<p>Drugs that prevent the reestablishment of a normal methylation pattern during any of these sensitive periods would have consequences for genome stability, gene expression and organ development. These drugs may ultimately cause additional problems for the patient and potentially effect the next generation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands in promoters of expressed genes are normally unmethylated permitting access to transcription factors to initiate gene expression. However CpG islands on the X chromosome become methylated, contributing to inactivation of that X chromosome.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of CpG islands is locus specific, mitotically heritable, and can reduce gene expression. MeCpG can be bound by protein complexes that lead to condensation of chromatin into nucleosomes, preventing transcription.</p>
<p>Genes such as RB, MLH1, BRCA1, MGMT and Gstp1 are hypermethylated and silenced in cancer. Silencing of these tumor suppressor genes disturbs the balance of tumor/growth promoter gene expression relative to tumor suppressor gene expression potentially causing an abnormal increase in cell growth and division as well as affecting apoptosis or DNA repair.</p>
<p>DNA methylation found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements prevents expression from cryptic promoters, maintains genomic stability and maintains nucleosome structure.</p>
<p>In many diseases including cancer, genomic hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements could promote abnormal (oncogene or long noncoding RNA) expression or promote illegitimate recombination causing chromosomal additions/deletions or translocations. In both cases loss of methylation could initiate nucleosome unwinding exposing DNA to transcription factors, thereby promoting gene expression from normally silent promoters. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) expressed as a result of this unwinding could associate with complexes that remodel chromatin, affecting expression of many other genes responsible for maintaining cell identity and eventually promoting tumor growth or disease.</p>
<p>Mutations in proteins responsible for maintaining the status of DNA methylation can lead to disease and/or cancer. Inactivation of DNMT3B reduces DNA methylation, increasing genomic instability around centromeres causing ICF syndrome. The expression of brain UBE3a in the Snrpn cluster is controlled by an lncRNA. Hypomethylation of the maternal copy of the PWS-IC can eliminate UBE3A expression in the brain leading to Angelman Syndrome.</p>
