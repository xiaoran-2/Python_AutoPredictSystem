    <div class="field-value"><blockquote>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code"><strong>DNA Methylation at CpG islands:</strong> Normally the CpG islands present in promoter region of essential genes are hypomethylated. That means, the gene is being expressed. But in cancer cells these regions may become hypermethylated, especially in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, so that they are silenced.</p>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code"> </p>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code">           When the CpG islands are hypermethylated many important genes involved in maintaining the normal cell division, like the cell cycle regulators, are not expressed, and hence the cell divides without check leading to onset of cancer.</p>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code"> </p>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code"><strong>DNA Methylation in Intergenic regions and Repetitive elements:</strong> Normally the intergenic and repetitive elements are hypermethylated and silenced. In, cancer cells, these regions are found to be hypermethylated, so that these regions can now be functional. This may lead to the abberations in chromosomal structures like deletions, additions etc. of repetitive sequences or abnormal gene expression from intergenic regions.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>METHYLATION PATTERN OF MATERNAL ALLELE:</strong>  The Imprint control Region (ICR) in maternal allele is not methylated, hence, the insulator protein CTCF can bind to it and in turn blocks the binding of enhancers to igf2, the product of which act as growth stimulators. The enhancers are directed to H19 instead.</p>
<p><strong>METHYLATION PATTERN OF PATERNAL ALLELE:</strong> The ICR is methylated which might even extend to the promoter of H19. The insulator protein CTCF cannot bind to it and hence the enhancers ( that has more affinity to Igf2) binds to Igf2 and expresses it.</p>
<p>         Since, only one allele of Igf2 is active , limited amount of growth promoter is produced and hence growth of cell is normal.</p>
<p>WILM'S TUMOUR: In this tumour the maternal imprinting is disrupted as the ICR in maternal allele becomes hypermethylated, so that CTCF cannot bind to it and hence the Igf2 cannnot be insulated from the enhancers. Basically, the effect is like having two paternal alleles. The result is the over expression of Igf2 which is a growth promoter. Consequently, it leads to tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class if DNA methyl transferase inhibitors. So, basically it inhibits the methylation of DNA. Decitabine can have an anti tumour affect when it is used to inhibit hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes. The hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes is known to be causing cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation are mitotically inheritable unless it is completely removed by using some drugs such as DNMTi. These drugs are capable of altering DNA methylation the most during the sensitive periods such as primordial germ cell development and during early embryo development. These sentitive periods are the ones where epigenetic reprogramming is occuring. So, there is the maximum chance of completely erasing or altering DNA methylation by these drugs at the sensitive periods,</p>
<p>However, it is not advisable to treat patients during the sensitive periods as some of the epigenetic marks are necessary for normal functioning of the genome, which will be erased out if treated with drugs during sensitive period.</p></div>
