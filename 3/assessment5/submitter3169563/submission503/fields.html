    <div class="field-value"><p>Mammalian DNA is methylated (with some) at CpG dinucleotides (a methylgroup is added to the 5<sup>th</sup> atom of cytosine’s pyrimidine ring). Most of CpG dinucleotides are clustered in so-called CpG islands, most of which are located upstream of the genes, in the promoter regions. Methylation of such island will silence the respective gene. This is essential for cell differentiation into about 300 types, that differs by which genes are shut down.</p>
<p>Other CpG islands are located in Imprint Control Regions (ICR) – methylation status of these determines expression of the imprinted genes.</p>
<p>Methylation of intragenic and itergenic and regions helps to neutralise interspersed repetitive elements (IRA), that will otherwise move along DNA landing within protein coding sequences, changing them. Another problem is alternative promoters and splice sites contained within these elements –first ones affect DNA transcription, the other –mRNA processing. This all result in different proteins being expressed.</p>
<p>Besides, changes in DNA sequence may lead to recombination of homologous chromosomes errors in meiosis, resulting in chromosome deletions, translocations insertions that affect gene dosage. The strong promoters of repetitive elements can disrupt transcription or enhance transcription (unnecessary) of neighbouring genes.</p>
<p>Silencing is achieved by methylating promoters of these elements and inducing sequence mutations – methylcytosine is easily deaminated to tymine.</p>
<p>Such changes enhances genomic stability:</p>
<p>DNA methylation pattern in cancer cells is practically reversed. Promoters of tumour suppressor genes are highly methylated (inactivating them), CpG poor-promoters (of protooncogenes) are hypomethylated (activating them) so the cells can proliferate rapidly and unrestrictedly.</p>
<p>Methylation of repetitive elements in cancer cells is largely removed, which leads to genomic instability.</p>
<p>Imprint control regions are either hypermethylated or hypomethylated, but both lead to loss of imprinting and overexpression of certain genes that contribute to cell proliferation.</p>
<p>And finally genome-wide hypomethylation impedes chromatin condensation making unneeded genes available for transcription.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 and IGF2 (insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) genes are located close to each other on the chromosome 11 (H19 downstream to IGF2). Normally IGF2 is expressed only from paternally-inherited chromosome, but H19 – from maternally inherited. It is achieved through methylation of the imprint control region (ICR), located between IGF2 and H19. This imprint control region is unmethylated on maternal allele, and methylated on paternal allele. Unmethylated allele can be bound by CTCF protein (an insulator), which protects IGF2 from enhancers downstream to H19, so enhancers will act on H19. Methylated ICR cannot be bound by CTFC, so enhancers can act on IGF2 (because of chromatin looping). If both alleles are methylated according to the paternal type, it results in overexpression of the growth promoting IGF2, leading to overly active cell proliferation and inhibition of programmed cell death.</p>
<p>IGF2 overexpression among many contributes to development of Wilm’s tumour (about 50% of all cases). This renal malignancy is result of abnormal proliferation and poor differentiation of renal stem cells. Degree of differentiation is inversely proportional to the outcome of disease, so the less IGF2 is overexpressed, the better.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) inhibitor. Decitabine is a cytidine analogue (except that 5<sup>th</sup> atom of the pyrimidine ring is N instead of C), so it can be incorporated in DNA, however DNMT1 (enzyme that maintains methylation) cannot attach methylgroup to such base, so hemimethylated DNA remains hemymethylated, and, in the course of cell proliferation, cells that are methylated at particular locus, will be gradually replaced by unmethylated ones. This passive demethylation can reactivate tumour suppressor genes, which then will lead to the differentiation of cancer cells (cancers with more differentiated cells are less aggressive), growth suppression and programmed cell death.</p>
<p>Another mechanism of action of decitabine is direct cytotoxicity: DNMT1 binds to decitabine incorporated in the DNA, thus disrupting DNA replication and slowing cell proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNMT inhibitors can help to deal with resistance to standard chemotherapy agents caused by defective apoptosis pathway or inability of cell to metabolise chemotherapy drugs to active forms. If genes necessary for these processes are simply shut down (not mutated or absent) DNA hypomethylation can reactivate them, making cells more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p>
<p>However, since DNMT inhibitors are not selective, they can reactivate genes that have to stay shut down. It can have grave consequences during certain sensitive periods that correlate with phases of rapid development.</p>
<p>The most sensitive periods are development of germ cells and early embryonic development (because of thorough epigenetic reprogramming). Any mistakes (e.g. leaving certain gene or genes unmethylated), will impede cell differentiation, that is essential both for development of normal gametes and of embryo. In addition, undifferentiated cells can lead to embryonic stem cell cancer (e.g. teratocarcinoma).</p>
<p>So drugs that non-selectively inhibit DNA methylation (in all cells, instead of just cancer) are not the best choice for treating of pregnant women. However organ development, continues no only during entire pregnancy but also after birth (e.g. brain), so possible side-effects of epigenetic drugs must be evaluated also when treating children.</p></div>
