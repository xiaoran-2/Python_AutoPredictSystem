    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands in promoters normally silence gene expression. In cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated, which leads to decreased levels of gene expression. Hypermethylation of tumour suppressor gene promoters silences their genes in cancer cells. Examples include the silencing of <em>RB</em> in retinoblastoma, <em>MLH1</em> in colorectal cancer, <em>BRCA1</em> in breast cancer, and <em>MGMT</em> in gliomas and colorectal tumours. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters (relatively rare) can result in activation of oncogenes. Examples include <em>R-RAS</em> in gastric cancer, <em>MicroRNA (miR21)</em> that targets the tumour suppressor <em>PTEN</em> and is active in glioma.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions function to maintain genomic integrity and silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. DNA methylation at repetitive elements function to maintain genomic integrity by silencing repetitive elements to prevent transposition. DNA methylation is mutagenic, so mutation of the repeats (meC to T) also prevent transposition. Methylation of the long terminal repeats may also silence strong promoters that cause transcriptional interference. Finally, methylation of repeats may prevent illegitmate chromosomal recombination by compacting the chromatin to the heterochromatin form.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, which leads to increased genomic instability (deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions), expression of cryptic promoters (transcriptional interference) and abnormal splicing of the pre-mRNA transcript. To elaborate, repetitive elements that are not heterochromatinized may be similar enough in sequence on different chromosomes to allow non-homologous reciprocal translocations to occur. Activation of cryptic promotors produces copies of repetitive elements that may insert into other genes as well as increased expression of genes downstream of their promotors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated and is NOT bound by CTCF protein. The enhancer will not be insulated from Igf2 by CTCF, so it will increase expression of Igf2. Furthermore, DNA methylation will spread from the ICR to the H19 promoter, causing downexpression of other genes. On the maternal allele, the ICR insulator is NOT methylated and is bound by CTCF, causing the enhancers to increase expression of the H19 gene but not that of Igf2. </p>
<p>In cancer cells of Wilm's tumor, hypermethylation of ICR on the maternal allele prevents CTCF from binding. Thus, the enhancers of both the maternal and paternal allele will not be insulated by CTCF from contacting Igf2, allowing upregulation of the target gene. A double dose of Igf2 (growth-promotoer) and the lack of H19 protein product (tumor suppressor) contributes to the uncontrolled cell growth associated with Wilm's (kidney) tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, specifically a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMT), that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly binds to DNMT after being incorporated into DNA and thereby preventing the copying of the DNA methylation pattern to the daughter strand . Because decitabine is replication dependent, this epigenetic drug has a higher effect on rapidly dividing cancer cells than normal cells. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by demethylating CpG islands in promotors of tumour suppressor genes which leads to increased tumor supressors .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome because these changes are mitotically heritable. Changes in DNA methylation can be inherited during replication by the action of DNMT1 which recognizes hemi-methylated DNA as the substrate. Aberrant DNA hypermethylation of promoters of tumour suppressors and genes encoding growth adhesion molecules or growth-regulatory proteins can lead to silencing of these genes which can result in malignancy. </p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming during which epigenetic marks are cleared and reset. Specific sensitive periods during development include pre-implantation development (zygote to blastocyst) and during germ line development (primordial germ cell development). Treating patients during sensitive periods may disturb the normal epigenetic reprogramming occuring in the developing embryo or in the primordial germ cells. For instance, administering a DNA demethylating agent like decitabine to a patient may increase the risk of her child developing Angelman's syndrome and Beckwith Wiedmann syndrome later in life.</p></div>
