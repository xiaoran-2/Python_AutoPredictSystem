    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands typically occur at gene promoters.  When such a CpG island is methylated, the nearby gene's expression is usually suppressed.  In general, CpG islands are not methylated in normal cells.  In the case of cancer, as cells progress from being normal to neoplastic to invasive, the degree of methylation increases for some CpG islands (and their "shores"--neighboring regions with lower rates of CpGs).  Over-methylated CpG islands in cancer are often associated with tumor suppressor genes.  Since such epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation) are mitotically heritable, these changes get locked into the cell's progeny (in the absence of medical treatment).  This locking-in means that cancer-promoting "hits" (genetic or epigenetic) can accumulate in a cell line.  Lightning does not have to strike in the same place <strong>simultaneously</strong>, so to speak.  (For example, a given tumor suppressor gene might require suppression of both alleles before there is a loss of function.)  There is a microevolutionary snowball effect--cell lines from a few cells accumulate such changes, with increasing tumor-like phenotypes, and therefore multiplying more than their neighbors.</p>
<p>In general, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in a normal cell are methylated, helping to ensure genetic stability.  In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements increasingly lose methylation as the disease progresses, typically contributing to genomic instability (deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations), although effects are location dependent.  Hypomethylation (and cancer-related chromatin unpacking) expose repeats, allowing recombinatorial mis-alignment, including between non-homologous chromosomes.  (Being repeats, there are many potential locations of mis-alignment.)  Also, exposed repeats can now insert themselves elsewhere, possibly disrupting or inappropriately promoting genes near the new location.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, the H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted.  That is, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated in the paternal allele.  Downstream from the ICR are enhancers that enhance Igf2 expression when the ICR is methylated, as in the paternal allele.  By contrast, the unmethylated ICR in the maternal allele binds an insulator protein, CTCF, which blocks the enhancers from enhancing Igf2 expression.  (The ICR in the paternal allele, being methylated, cannot bind CTCF.)</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor there is loss of imprinting.  Specifically, the ICR is methylated in <strong>both</strong> the maternal and paternal alleles.  This means that there is increased expression of Igf2.  As Igf2 promotes growth, the result is Wilm's tumor, a childhood kidney tumor.</p>
<p>Another reason for loss of imprinting in the H19/Igf2 cluster is a mutation or deletion that results in both the maternal and paternal alleles behaving like the paternal alleles, again resulting in overexpression of Igf2.  When accompanied by loss of expression of Cdkn1c (for similar mis-imprinting reasons), this can lead to Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome.  Symptoms can include perinatal overgrowth, a large tongue, and childhood (but not adult) tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), used to effect DNA demethylation.  (So far it is most promising in myelodysplastic syndrome and/or acute myeloid leukemia.)  Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which gets incorporated into the daughter DNA during mitosis.  Decitabine irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1), inhibiting the bound DNMT1 from its function of copying the pattern of DNA methylation to the daughter strands.  Being dependent on cell division, and since cancer cells proliferate relatively quickly, decitabine tends to affect cancer cells more than other cells.  The exact mechanism is unknown, but the result is non-specific.  In fact, at high doses, decitabine is toxic; at lower doses, it demethylates DNA and has an antitumor effect.  The beneficial mechanism may be demethylation of CpG islands at tumor suppressor genes, causing increased expression of those genes (which had been methylated during the course of the disease).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During mitosis, the enzyme DNMT1 copies the pattern of DNA methylation from a cell to its daughter cells.  Therefore, a change to DNA methylation, and therefore gene expression, is enduring, as it affects not only the cell, but its progeny cells as well.</p>
<p>There are two major "sensitive periods" of DNA methylation remodelling.  These involve clearing of DNA methylation followed by methylation reprogramming, with the methylation pattern depending on the particular cell type.  One period occurs when primordial germ cells are generated until they develop into mature gametes.  The other spans a time from soon after fertilization until soon after implantation.  (An exception is that repeats are usually methylated, with only slight dips during the sensitive periods.  Also, imprinted gene remodelling does not occur during the embryo sensitive period.)</p>
<p>Treating a patient with a drug that alters DNA methylation is potentially dangerous because across-the-board changes might have bad side effects.  Treatment during a sensitive period (e.g. in childhood while germ cells are still maturing) is particularly dangerous because it could disrupt the reprogramming process (instead of simply altering a relatively fixed methylation pattern).  This could include a failure to (re)methylate some repeats, increasing genetic instability.</p>
