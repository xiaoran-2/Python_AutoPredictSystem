    <h1>Submission 436 from Anon (session_user_id: 6ad00464e336feedf626a66a75aeaef3323a67be)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methylation (DNA-demethylating agent or hypomethylation agent) that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Suppressor genes can be blocked by an increase in DNA methylation and, given the fact that suppressor genes regulate cell division and growth, the blockage of their activity promotes cancer. Therefore, control over cell growth can be achieved through the action of Decitabine by demethylation of DNA because, in this way, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster is located on human chromosome 11. In this cluster, the imprinted control region (ICR) is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal, therefore Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele and not from the maternal one. That is because DNA methylation at imprint control region blocks CTCF binding, which is an insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Hence, if CTCF is not binding and there is no insulator action then these enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and promote its expression from the paternal allele. However, the ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele, thus CTCF can be binded and it is able to insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Due to Igf2 insulated, these enhancers are free to act on H19 (long noncoding RNA) and enhance H19 expression on the maternal allele, nevertheless H19 is no longer active on the paternal one because DNA methylation at ICR spreads to H19 promoter to silence it.</p>
<p>Willm's tumour is caused by hypermethylation of ICR that result in Igf2 overexpression. With loss of imprinting the ICR on the maternal allele is methylated as well, thus, Igf2 is also expressed on it having a double dose of Igf2 in comparision to a normal cell where Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation at CpG islands </strong>occurs at 5' group of cytosines within CpG dinucleotides, these dinucleotides are symmetrical and this symmetry allows them to be maintained through cell division (mitotic heritability). CpG islands are often found at the promoters of genes (the start side of transcription), they tend to be protected from methylation but some of them are methylated and that leads to silencing of gene expression. Therefore, DNA methylation at CpG islands is an inactive epigenetic mark and this mark is stable because at every cell division DNA methylation is copied by DNMT1, a DNA methyltransferase enzyme, onto the new daughter strands of DNA. Other regions in where DNA methylation occurs are <strong>intergenic regions and repetitive</strong> <strong>elements</strong>, in fact, it tends to be there. DNA methylation at intergenic regions is thought to maintain genomic integrity because without the appropriate methylation at these regions many things can happen due to the genomic instability: deletions, duplications, translocations. This methylation also causes some silencing of gene expression, silencing cryptic promoters or cryptic splice sites. DNA methylation at repetitive elements also maintains genomic stability by cutting or making a copy of themselves and pasting it into somewhere else in the genome.</p>
<p>There are two types of<strong> DNA methylation abnormalities</strong>: DNA hypermethylation and genome-wide hypomethylation. In a cancer cell, in general, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than in a normal one, while the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hypomethylated. In general, CpG islands are in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, thus DNA hypermethylation (that is locus-specific) leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes. DNA hypermethylation, unlike genetic mutations, is reversible and it tends to be more frequent. On the other hand, in cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated and the consequence depends on location. Genome-wide hypomethylation is very common and it seems to happen early, in tumorigenesis. It leads to genomic instability like illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A sensitive period is a period in which the early environment is able to interact directly with genes and regulate their activity in the central nervous system, a period in which we have heightened sensitivity to environmental influences. Experiences and environmental factors during sensitive periods of development influence DNA methylation patterns, which represent stable epigenetic modifications that alter gene transcription throughout lifespan. In epigenetics, sensitive periods of development are found in early embryonic development, which corresponds to the pre-implantation period, and in primordial germ cell development. During these periods, epigenetic marks are cleared allowing re-expression of genes required to restore totipotency (epigenetic reprogramming). And DNA methylation at the imprint control regions is established in primordial germ cells to achieve parent-of-origin particular marks, being maintained in the embryo (genomic or gametic imprinting).</p>
<p>It is through these programming effects that environmental factors are thought to confer either risk or resilience regarding later pathology. Drugs administration during sensitive periods must be avoided because it can produce hypo or hyperresponsiveness to environmental or pharmacological factors later in life.</p></div>
