    <h1>Submission 491 from Anon (session_user_id: 18d70b8c5d8792669f7c580e6606f65def592e6b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Once DNA methylation is established, it is transmitted through mitosis and maintained after DNA replication by DNMT1. Due to the feature of mitotic heritability, DNA methylation laid down in parental cells can have long-term effects on the epigenome of other somatic cells, since it is passed on to daughter cells during cell division. As a result, effects of drugs that alter DNA methylation can be maintained through subsequent cell generations and last beyond the period of drug treatment. The alterations caused by epigenetic drugs might therethrough enhance efficiency of standard chemotherapy.</p>
<p>This is of particular importance during sensitive periods in early life of patients when gametogenesis and sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic machinery are increased. Every alteration in DNA methylation during this period is likely to change normal patterns of DNA methylation and have undesirable effects on epigenetic marks of the cell. For this reason, treatment of young patients might be inadvisable.</p>
<p>The other sensitive period could be pregnancy, since the impact of mother's treatment might alter epigenetic machinery of the embryo and  harmfully affect its cellular development during the sensitive periods of  epigenetic reprogramming- primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors and is used in treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Decitabine is a demethylating agent, which means that it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. After being incorporated into DNA, decitabine irreversibly binds DNMT and blocks its function in DNA methylation.</p>
<p>Since decitabine is replication dependent, it is particularly efficient in cancer cells, which devide and replicate their DNA much more rapidly than unaffected cells. By the process of DNA demethylation normal function to the tumour suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</p>
<p>Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites. When incorporated into the cellular metabolism, it produces cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p>
<p>Although it lacks specificity in its mechanism of action, decitabine has good antineoplastic effects in lower doses and is most effective in treatment of MDS.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that involves addition of a methyl group to the cytosine or adenine DNA nucleotides. DNA methylation alters the expression of genes in cells as they divide thus enabling them to differentiate from embryonic stem cells into specific cell types based on activating or silencing of particular genes.</p>
<p>In adult somatic cells DNA methylation typically occurs at CpG dinucleotides. Methylated C residues deaminate to form T residues, hence CpG dinucleotides become TpG nucleotides.</p>
<p>Unmethylated CpGs are usually grouped in clusters called CpG islands. In disease processes such as cancer, CpG island hypermethylation can be detected in promoters of tumour suppressor genes, thus silencing those genes which play an important role in cell growth control. Hypermethylation can be passed on to daughter cells during mitosis and can rapidly spread onto a whole tissue or organ.Therefore, alterations of DNA at CpG islands are essential hallmarks of cancer development.</p>
<p>A less common form of DNA methylation disruption is hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters, which can result in activation of oncogenes.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements and intergenic regions represent a large portion of the human genome and contain much of the CpG methylation found in normal somatic cells. The main function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is maintenance of genomic stability and integrity. DNA methylation in these regions might account for most of global hypomethylation that characterises all tumour types to a certain degree. Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation is followed by genomic instability which entails activation of repetitive elements, their illegitimate recombination (reciprocal translocation, deletion, insertion ) and transposition in the genome. All these disruptions of genomic integrity may lead to overexpression of oncogenes and underexpression of genes responsible for cell growth control.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The closely linked H19 and Igf2 genes show highly similar patterns of gene expression but are reciprocally imprinted. H19 is expressed from maternal chromosome, while Igf2 is expressed from paternal chromosome. There are two regulatory regions that play an important role in their parental allele-specific expression: a differentially methylated region (DMR) upstream of H19 and tissue-specific enhancers downstream of H19.</p>
<p>ICR (imprinting control region) is methylated on maternal allele and unmethylated on paternal allele ( it is paternally imprinted ). When ICR is unmethylated, it is bound by CTCF - an insulator protein. It insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers, which are now free to enhance H19 expression.</p>
<p>On paternal allele, ICR is methylated and thus inhibits binding of CTCF. Without CTCF, enhancers can access Igf2 and promote its expression. DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter and blocks its expression.</p>
<p>In humans, loss of imprinting at this locus is associated with cancer. The maternal allele reverses to paternal epigenotype, with a patternal pattern of methylation of H19 promoter - Igf turned on and H19 turned off, which results in reduced expression of H19 and increased cell growth. This type of tumorigenesis is called Wilm's tumour - embryonic or childhood tumour found in kidney.</p></div>
