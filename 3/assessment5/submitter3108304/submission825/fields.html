    <div class="field-value"><p>Expression of the part of DNA sequence that is methylated is usually suppressed. Normally methylation is useful in controlling the predetermined gene expression state of that particular cell type. CpG islands are found in a greater proportion near promotor sites of several genes. Methylation of these CpG islands usually silence the expression of the nearby genes. However, such methylation is found at a low level in CpG islands in normal cells thus keeping the expression open. In cancers, the CpG islands and the nearby region known as CpG island shores are hypermethylated. They were found in some solid tumors like Ca Breast, Colorectal cancers, Leukemias and  and the genetic pattern was described as Cpg island metylator phenotpe(CIMP). This is mostly found in the DNA sequences corresponding to tumor suppressor genes such as cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors, DNA repair genes, apoptosis mediators and cell adhesion molecules which are silenced or lowyl expressed. This leads to loss of controll and hyper expression of genes involved with oncogenic pathways like uncontrolled proliferation, increased survival of aberrant cells and acquisition of stem cell characteristics.</p>
<p>Methylation of intergenic regions and repeatative elements usually keep these genomic areas silenced as these are not required for normal function of the particular cell. Expression of these areas would lead to increaesd dose and expression of non required genes leading to aberrant cell function. In cancers these areas are found widely hypomethylated leading to aberrant growth and proliferation of cells. The intergenic regions containing codes for microRNAs, piRNAs and lncRNAs when hypomethylated lead to expression of these normally unrequired factors that act in many oncogenic pathways. There is increased loss of epigenetic controll by increased chromatin remodelling via histone modification and increased chromosomal instability by altered DNA repair mechanism. Some act directly by promoting proliferative pathways. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In paternal allele the ICR close to igf2 is methylated. Thus the igf2 is free to action of downstrem enhancers and is increasingly expressed. In maternal allele the ICR is non methylated and thus is protected b CTCF. This inhibits action of downstream enhancers on igf2 leading to decreased expression. In Wilm's Tumpour there is loss of imprinting leading to maternal allele behaving like paternal allele or there is uniparental disomy leading to both the alleles behaving like paternal allele. This leads to overdose or increased expression of igf2 which is a grwth promoter. Because of this there is uncontrolled growth and predisposition to increased embryonic/ childhood tumours. Phenotpically there is macroglossia and fetal or post natal overgrowth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine a hypomethylating agent that works by inhibiting DNA methyl tranferase. Decitabine decreases methylation leading to reversal of silencing and increased expression of the corresponding genes.Decitabine is primarily used in different types of Myelodisplastic Syndromes. It works by removing silencing of genes involved in normal development and growth thus restoring the functionality of blood cell progenitors and stemcells in bonemarrow. Thus the aberrant pathway is reversed in tumours and the patients' lifespan is increased.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As epigenetic changes are heritable and can be passed through mitosis they have long lasting effects. When DNA methylation is altered that altered state is also maintained until they are rewritten by some envieonmental or genetic changes. A period in which epigenetic alteration takes place is known as sensitive period including period of primodial germ cell formation and development and preimplantation period and early development period in embryo etc. Treatment targeting to alter some specific hypermethylation or hypomethylation has to be done carefully. If the drugs are given during sensitive periods it will lead to widespread non specific alteration in methylation pattern leading to aberrations in normal epiginome which itself will cause problem due to aberrant expression/ silencing pattern of many genes and epigenome.</p></div>
