    <div class="field-value"><p>At the promoters of genes, where transcriptions factors bind, can be found a group of CpG dinucleotides, called CpG islands. In normal cells, this clustered CpG’s tend to be protected from methylation, so transcription can occur. In cancer cells, the DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted and now is hypermethylated, resulting in the formation of a repressive chromatin structure (heterochromatin) and the silencing of gene expression.  This CpG island hypermethylation can lead to a disease when the silenced underlying genes are tumor suppressor genes and therefore cause cancer, like gliomas.</p>
<p>In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. This results in the maintenance of genomic stability. That occurs because the promoter´s methylation of the repeats silence the expression for proteins required for the transposition to another region of the genome.Cryptic promoters can be found in the intergenic regions, they interfere with the transcription, but methylation can avoid this. Also, the methylation arrange the heterochromatin required to prevent illegitimate recombination of the repeats.  In cancer cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are no longer methylated, instead of that, are hypomethylated and produce genomic instability. This hypomethylation lead to the activation of repeats, and then the transposition to another region, mutating other genes. The cryptic promoters are now hypomethylated, acting in the surrounding regions. Also, the hypomethylation allow the illegitimate recombination by the opening of the chromatin, resulting in deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.</p>
<p>In the case of diseases, the depletion of DNA methylation intergenic regions and repetitive elements can enhance tumorigenesis, by the loss of genomic stability. Diseases like ICF syndrome are produced by genomic instability due to hypomethyletion of pericentromeric repeats. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the maternal allele, the CTCF insulator element is attached on the imprinted control region so it is unmethylated. Therefore, the enchancers will act on H19, silencing the expression of lgf2. On the paternal allele, the ICR and H19 are methylated, so CTCF is not attached and the enchancers will act on lgf2 instead on H19.</p>
<div>
<p>In Wilm´s tumor there is a disrupting of imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster and an overexpression of lgf2 because on the maternal allele the ICR are now methylated, letting the enchancers act on lgf2. This will result in growth promoting causing the Wilm´s tumor, a childhood kidney tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. The Decitabine is a nucleoside analog, so it can be incorporated to the DNA upon replication and then inhibit the action of DNMT, when it is going to copy the methylation to the daughter strand.  The DNMTi can’t be released and this mechanism is irreversible. Also, the DNMTi is division dependent so the cancer cells will be more affected because they divide more than the other cells.</p>
<div>
<p>When suppressor genes are methylated, cell division becomes unregulated, promoting the formation of tumors. Decitabine has an antitumor effect because it inhibits the DNA methylation, and then the growth of the cancer cells can be regulated and restored.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because it is mitotically heritable. All the DNA modifications and epigenetic marks will pass to the daughter, granddaughter and the subsequent cells until they are actively erased.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of development when the organism is susceptible to environmental signals and when the epigenetic marks are cleared and reset (epigenetic reprogramming).  A sensitive period can be in the primordial germ cells development. Also a sensitive period can be in the puberty of a man, when the maturity of sperm occurs.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the epigenetic machinery is more sensitive to environmental changes and if we bring them drugs that modify the epigenetic marks can lead to the inhibition of this epigenetic machinery having a wrong reorganization.</p></div>
