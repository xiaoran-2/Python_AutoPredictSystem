    <div class="field-value"><p class="Default">DNA methylation usually takes place at the 5′ position of the cytosine ring within CpG dinucleotides, and its consequence is the silencing of genes and noncoding genomic regions.   CpG sites are concentrated either in CpG islands, short CpG-rich DNA regions located in approximately 60% of human gene promoters or in regions of large repetitive sequences (i.e.centromeres and retrotransposon elements). Although in the latter case most of the CpGs are methylated to prevent chromosome instability.</p>
<p class="Default">In terms of DNA methylation, cancer cells show genome-wide hypomethylation and site-specific CpG island promoter hyper­methylation. DNA hypomethylation occurs at many genomic sequences, such as repetitive elements, retrotransposons, introns and the like, resulting in genomic instability. At repeat sequences, this is achieved by a higher rate of chromosomal rearrangements and, at retrotransposons, by a higher probability of translocation to other genomic regions</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="Default">CpG island methylation takes place during developmental phenomena such as X chromosome inactivation or genomic imprinting. Furthermore, aberrant DNA hypomethylation can also account for the activation of some proto-oncogenes and lead to loss of imprinting, as in the case of the IGF2<em> </em>gene (encoding insulin-like growth factor-2) in Wilm’s tumor</p>
<p class="Default">The maintenance of genomic imprinting of the murine insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) gene involves at least two factors: the DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase activity, which is required to preserve the paternal specific expression of Igf2, and the H19 gene which upon inactivation leads to relaxation of the Igf2 imprint. In normal individuals, IGF2 and H19 are methylated in male and not-methylated in female. Thus the IGF2 expression is from the paternal allele and H19 is from the maternal allele. In the wilm’s tumor, IGF2 activation and H19 silencing are associated with disruption of both maternal and paternal imprints. Inactivation of H19<em> </em>in Wilms’ tumors (WTs) occurs by one of two pathways: 45% of WTs show loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for chromosome 11p15, reflecting loss of the maternal homolog and duplication of the paternal homolog, while another 30% of cases retain both homologs but show H19<em> </em>inactivation by biallelic hypermethylation of the transcribed region and upstream sequences.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor and hypomethylates DNA. In cancer cells, hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides, may lead to genomic instability. On the other hand, dense methylation of CpG islands, particularly in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes, is associated with aberrant silencing of transcription. De-regulation of the DNMTs has been shown in many types of cancer including of the lung, breast, stomac h and colon. Fortunately, epigenetic alterations are potentially reversible, unlike genetic mutations. Therefore, such alterations have become an attractive target for cancer therapy. Since hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and overexpression of DNMTs have been established as the major key players in carcinogenesis, demethylating agents seem to be especially promising as anticancer drugs. Reexpression of aberrantly silenced genes and restoration of their normal function can be achieved through the use of DNMT inhibitors, such as decitabin, which are incorporated into the growing DNA strand and covalently bind DNMTs.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some drugs have been shown to interfere directly or indirectly with the normal control of DNA methylation, resulting in aberrant gene expression, by interacting with specific proteins which target particular DNA sequences, acting in concert with a DNA methyltransferase, or alternatively with a demethylating mechanism. Other drugs appear to induce epigenetic changes by interaction of the drug with a cell surface receptor, enzyme, or other protein, which alters expression of receptors, growth factors, ion channels, structural molecules, or transcription factors and which subsequently alters cellular homeostasis.</p>
<p>DNA methylation effects might be extremely teratogenic during embryogenesis and might have potential carcinogenic effects. It is well known that the pattern of DNA methylation is heritable, both through mitosis and from one generation to the next. The methylation program for development is reset in germ line cells, prior to, during or after meiosis. There is some information about the specific controls of DNA methylation in the germ line, and during early embryogenesis, and genomic imprinting is certainly associated with differences in DNA methylation in male and female gametes, and is a reversible change. There are also defects in genomic imprinting, such as the Prader Willi syndrome, which produce characteristic phenotypes. Thus a strong case can be made that induced abnormalities in DNA methylation caused by pharmaceutical drugs can produce defects in subsequent generations.</p>
