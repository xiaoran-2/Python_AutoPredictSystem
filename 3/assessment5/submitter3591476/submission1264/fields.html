    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>The levels of  DNA methylation at CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are found to be altered in cancer.</p>
<p>The CpG islands usually found in the protomoter regions of genes and are predominantly non- methylated. In normal cells both active and inactive genes can have unmethylated CpG islands. In the case of cancer, CpG islands are usually found to be hypermethylated leading to inactivation of genes. The silencing of tumor suppressor genes by CPIs methylation is often observed in cancer. This leads uncontrollable growth and proliferation, which contributes to the progression of disease.</p>
<p>On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in normal cells in order to prevent their activity and maintain genomic stability. However, these regions become hypomethylated in cancer, leading to genomic instability. Active repeats can be transcribed and transposed to random locations disrupting other genes. Presence of similar sequences across the genome can lead to unwanted recombinations. Moreover, hypomethylation can cause activation of cryptic promoters and transcription of oncogenes. All these events contribute to enhancement of tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The outcomes of alterations of DNA methylation can be changes in gene expression. When DNA methylation pattern at ICRs (imprinting control regions) changes, expression of growth restricting genes can be lost or genes promoting growth can become overexpressed. Both of these situations have a strong contribution to cancer.</p>
<p>In the case of H19/Igf2 cluster, normally paternal allele has a methylated ICR and H19 promoter region. Therefore, H19 is silenced (due to formation of heterochromatin) and ICR is free from CTCF insulator protein leading to expression of Igf2. On the other hand maternal allele has unmethylated ICR bound by CTCF insulator protein insulating Igf2 from downstream enhancers. These enhancers become enabled to act on H19 (has unmethylated promoter in maternal allele), therefore, it’s expressed. In the Wilm’s tumour case, both alleles have paternal methylation pattern, therefore, Igf2 is active while H19 is silenced in both alleles. Igf2 is growth promoting gene. Overexpression of it leads to uncontrollable growth of cells (which have loss of imprinting) and contributed to the development of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one type of epigenome effecting drugs that are already present on the market. Decitabine inhibits action of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), therefore it is called as DNA-demethylating agent. Hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes leads to silencing of these genes and is one of the major features of cancer. Agent inhibiting actions of DNMTs can prevent this hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes and, therefore, be used in the treatment against cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The changes of epigenome (for instance DNA methylation) are not only present in the cell where they are caused. These changes can be passed on to further generations of mother cell, the epigenome of which was altered. Therefore, epigenetic drug can have long lasting effect: treatment with DNMT inhibitor would cause hypomethylation of cell’s DNA and this hypomethylation would be transferred to daughter cells after cell division.</p>
<p>However, there are two periods during individual’s development when this treatment with epigenome altering drugs should be avoided. These periods are called sensitive periods (during early development and during primordial germ cell development). During sensitive periods epigenetic marks, which are present in the genome, are cleared and reset. Usage of epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods could cause disruption of epigenetic reprogramming leading to major unwanted consequences.</p></div>
