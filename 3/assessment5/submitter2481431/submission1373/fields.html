    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>CpG islands (CGI) are GC-rich regions , enriched for the dinucleotide CpG and are commonly associated with more than half of vertebrate gene promoters. Important functions of CGI methylation include (i)maintenance of X-chromosome inactivation after its establishment, (ii) Genomic imprinting to specify parent-of-origin specific mono-allelic expression, (iii)Gene silencing by blocking transcription factor binding via steric hindrance or by recruiting repressive methyl-binding domain containing proteins like MeCP2 and also by acting as promoters for certain non-coding RNAs which mediate neighboring gene silencing and (iv)Spreading of the silencing and consequent heterochromatin formation. Cancer cells are characterized by abnormal CGI hypermethylation leading to undesirable silencing of tumor-suppressor genes- genes involved in cell-cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, apoptosis, cell adhesion and cancer immunity. This is further exacerbated by aberrant methylation of the CGI-flanking regions called ‘CGI shores’. This methylation mediated epigenetic silencing at CGI evolves tumorigenicity in the cell by (i) stable inheritance of the methylation (ii) conferring a selective proliferative advantage for the cell and/or  (iii) silencing of tumor-suppressor genes. Intergenic regions are typically methylated to inhibit cryptic transcription, prevent cryptic splicing and ensure proper gene expression. Repetitive elements are also methylated for genomic stability by preventing (i) illegitimate recombination (ii) the transposition of repeats by their mutation or silencing leading to local genome compaction (iii) rogue transcription from strong promoters. It also plays a role in cellular host defence mechanisms.</strong> <strong>In cancer cells both repeats and intergenic regions become hypomethylated creating a more open chromatin leading to rogue transcription of adjacent potential proto-oncogenes , increased transposition leading to silencing of potentially important genes, misalignment and consequent illegitimate recombination between the repeats leading to genomic instability in the form of insertions, deletions and reciprocal translations ultimately translating into genetic instability.</strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Disrupted genomic imprinting leads to dosage imbalance of associated genes. One classic example is Wilm’s tumor,a type of kidney cancer associated with the IGF2/H19 locus. The locus consists of a pair of enhancers that can interact with the promoter of H19 gene or of the Igf2 gene depending on the binding/ non-binding respectively of a transcription factor called CTCF which recognizes hypomethylation at an imprint control region between the 2 genes. Both these genes are imprinted with H19 expressing maternally and Igf2 expressing paternally. The maternal allele is hypomethylated both at the CTCF-binding site and the H19 promoter leading to H19 expression and Igf2 insulation, while the paternal allele is hypermethylated at both sites leading to H19 inactivation and consequent enhancer activation at Igf2 leading to Igf2 expression. In Wilm’s tumor, the imprinting is disturbed leading to hypermethylation in the maternal allele which causes enhancer activation at Igf2 in the maternal allele accompanied by a decrease in H19 transcription. This leads to increased Igf2 and decreased H19 expressions. This is a double blow to the cell since Igf2 is a growth factor and H19 a growth suppressor and the cell is poised for Cancer.</strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine is a cytidine analog and DNA de-methylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.  It causes demethylation by incorporating into replicating DNA and blocking DNA methyl-transferase activity (Dnmt1) by irreversible binding to the enzyme leading to the formation of replicated DNA with hypomethylated cytosines. Since cancer cells are rapidly dividing, the drug is selectively taken up by the cancer cell in the context of non-dividing cells.This could have potential anti-tumor effect because it could block the aberrant CpG island hypermethylation in promoters of tumor suppressor genes which is characteristic of cancer cells and thereby reverse silencing of genes involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and cell adhesion. Decitabine has been shown to do all of the above and also reverse tumor cell resistance. It has also been found to induce cell differentiation. Its efficacy is increased when used in combination with HDAC-inhibitors.</strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation is dynamic and follows patterns which can be impacted by drugs that alter DNA methylation. While, factors like age, sex, targeted cell type play key roles in determining applicability of the drug, epigenetic drugs are still at their infancy with their effects on the epigenome still general and need extensive further research and documentation.  Since the epigenome is inherited and maintained, any drug-induced changes in methylation are bound to be passed on and preserved even after the treatment period. DNA methylation is important both in the context of gene maintenance (regulating the chromatin architecture) and gene expression, so any deleterious alteration is intolerable.  A sensitive period in epigenetics refers to a period of development wherein the epigenome is susceptible to various environmental signals. There are 2 known sensitive periods in mammalian (human) development – Germ cell development and early development. These periods are particularly important in the context of maternal and paternal imprinted genes which are differentially regulated and any drug mediated disturbance in the pattern could lead to undesirable and lasting consequences since both these stages seed cells for extensive rounds of proliferation and multiple lineages that follow. Therefore treatment in these periods is to be avoided.</strong></p></div>
