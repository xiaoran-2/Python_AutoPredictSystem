    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands often contain activators and enhancers, and are normally hypomethylated; but in cancer they - and often also regions nearby, known as CpG island shores - become hypermethylated, switching off parts of the genome that should be active. In particular, the inactivation of these regions is often associated with silencing of tumour-suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Normally, intergenic regions are methylated to silence the many retroviral insertion residues (LINEs, SINEs, e.g.) which they contain. Repetitive elements also are normally methylated, which prevents invalid transpositions/splicings between different chromosomes. However, in cancer intergenic and repetitive element methylation is lost, leading to genomic instability: when methylation is lost at intergenic regions and repetitive elements many errors and mis-recombinations can occur, leading to parts of one chromosome being spliced onto parts of other entirely different chomosomes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated at the paternal allele (paternally imprinted); methylation at the paternal imprint control region (ICR) prevents CTCF binding (an isulator protein), and spreads downstream to silence H19, giving the enhancers in the cluster unobstructed access to enhance Igf2 expression. Whereas, the maternal allele is unmethylated at the ICR, allowing binding of CTCF - preventing enhancers from accessing Igf2, which silences it - and causing the enhancers to enhance H19 expression instead. Thus, Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele, and H19 only from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, only the paternal version of the H19/Igf2 cluster is present - leading to too much expression of Igf2, which is an oncogene. Frequently, imprinted genes are involved in growth regulation - either as tumour suppressors, or as oncogenes - so disruption of their imprinting can cause misregulation of cell growth and lead to cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, specifically a DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) which is a nucleoside analogue and acts by becoming incorporated into the DNA, after which it can irrevocably bind DNMT when DNMT comes to transfer methyl marks, thus preventing copying of methylation to daughter cells. This is useful in the treatment of cancers such as AML, where hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes are implicated; demethylating the areas which have become erroneously methylated (i.e. silenced) in cancer should reactivate some normal regulatory function, such as tumour suppressive activity.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, thus epigenetic DNA methylation patterns can be passed on to daughter and granddaughter cells, persisting unless actively altered; in this way, epigenetic effects from epigenome-altering drugs could continue indefinitely. A sensitive period is one during which extensive epigenetic erasure &amp; reprogramming takes place, when the epigenome is particularly susceptible to external influences. The most sensitive periods are during early development (pre-implantation through blastocyst stage) when reprogramming of somatic cells occurs; and during primordial germ cell development (mid-gestation -&gt; childhood) when PGCs have parent-of-origin imprinting removed and are re-imprinted to reflect the sex of the new individual. Administration of methylation-altering drugs at an epigenetically sensitive period could adversely affect the epigenome in somatic cells and/or in germ cells, depending which sensitive period(s) exposure took place; this is of particualr concern with regards to gene imprinting, since imprinted locations have only one working copy of the gene with no back-up.</p>
