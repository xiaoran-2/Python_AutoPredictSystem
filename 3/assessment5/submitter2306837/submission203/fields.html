    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cell, CpG islands are usually hypomethylated, while the surrounding repetitive elements, intergenic regions, and introns of genes are hypermethylated. However, in a cancer cell, the other way is true. In cancer cell, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, while the surrounding repetitive elements, intergenic regions, and introns of genes are hypomethylated. CpG islands usually are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. By silencing the CpG islands, and consequently the promoters, it suppresses the tumor suppressor genes, which in turn could be one of the hints that leads to tumorigenesis. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>In normal function of DNA methylation, integenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypermethylated. In cancer, the hypomethylated repeats and integenic regions contributes to genomic instability, such as the repetitive elements could more easily jumping around the genome. They can lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activated of repeats, and transpose of repeats to other genes. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele in normal cell, the imprinting region is hypermethylated and CTCF can't bind to the insulator. As a result, the enhancers can act on lgf2 and lgf2 is expressed on the paternal allele. </p>
<p>On the maternal allele in normal cell, the imprinting region is hypometylated, so CTCF binds to its insulated element, which leaves the enhancers to act on H19, and lgf2 will be silenced from the maternal allele. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the imprinting region of the maternal allele is now also hypermethylated, which leads to an expression of lgf2 from the maternal allele as well. This leads to over-expression of lgf2, which is a growth promoting gene. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, sold as Dacogen by a Japanese Company named Eisai. It is used on Myelodysplastic syndrome which is a precursor to acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). Decitabine is nusceloside analogues, it gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication, so when DNMT1 binds to the DNA, the nuceotide is to copy the methylation to the daughter strand irreversibly. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is cell division dependent so cell replication is necessary. Since cancer cell is usually dividing and replicating faster than normal cell, Decitabine will have stronger impact on cancer cell than normal cell. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The effect for DNA methyltransferase inhibitor or histone deacetylase inhibitor are not selective to certain cell or even certain cancer cell, but to the whole body. The precise mechanism of action is still unknown. We are also uncertain if the inhibitors are working in the nuclear or cytoplasm.The long term, irreversible changes on the epigenome could be mitodically heritable and have long term effect. </p>
<p>The sensitive period is when many of the epigenic marks are being cleared and reset. There are two main sensitive periods, which are during the early development phrase and during primordial germ cells development. It is yet unclear how external intervention with drugs can affect the overall epigenomic states during the sensitive period, or even during somatic maintenance stage. These can have long term unforeseen consequences by altering the epigenome. </p></div>
