    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA methylation (DNAme) is one of the epigenetic marks involved in control of gene expression. In mammals this occurs mainly at CG dinucleotides clustered in CpG islands (CGi). CGi are usually unmethylated and their methylation at the promoters of genes related to gene silencing, since it causes further condensation of chromatin, forming a repressive structure and may also implicate an impediment for the binding of transcription factors. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements (together, they constitute the majority of the genome) are usually methylated, which is thought to maintain genomic integrity by preventing genomic instability (illegitimate recombinations, deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions) and transcriptional interference at cryptic transcription start sites or splice sites. The methylation of cytosine (meC) is mutagenic (the meC turns to T- thymine), so its methylation in these regions is thought to have a protective role (Genome Defense Model, proposed by Prof. Timothy Bestor). In cancer there are two major alterations in DNAme patterns: genome-wide (so, at intergenic regions and repetitive elements) hypomethylation and local (at CGi and CGi shores) hypermethylation. The CGi hypermethylation at promoters causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes; this alteration is mitotically heritable and is rapidly selected, since cells develop more quickly, therefore contributing to cancer evolution. The hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genetic instability, because they lack the protective alteration from C to T and are at a more open chromatin structure. Therefore, there's occurrence of illegitimate recombinations and the activation of repeats and transpositions which in turn leads to transcriptional interference and disruption of gene expression since these transpositions and recombinations my alter the open reading frame (ORF) of the genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Genomic imprinting causes monoallelic gene expression, in a parent-of-origin basis, which means that all cells express this allele and the other is imprintedly silent. The human imprinted genes exit in clusters and each cluster is controlled by the same imprint control region (ICR). DNA methylation of ICRs leads to differential expression of genes, but not necessarily to their silencing.</p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">The H19/Igf2 cluster is insulator-mediated imprinted. The ICR is located between the parentally expressed Igf2 (upstream) and the maternally imprinted H19 (downstream). Both genes share the same enhancers, downstream to H19. The ICR is unmethylated in the maternal allele allowing binding of CTCF (an insulator) and blocking the enhancers access to Igf2, and allowing their access to the H19 promoter. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and CTCF cannot bind; this methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, silencing it, and so the enhancers act upon Igf2.</p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In Wilm's tumor, there's a hypermethylation of the ICR causing biallelic expression of Igf2 (growth factor) and silencing of H19 (tumor suppressor). The overexpression of Igf2 causes an increase of cell growth, not balanced by H19, which is silent, and therefore leads to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Decitabine is a FDA approved inhibitor for DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). It is a nucleoside (cytidine) analog that irreversibly binds DNMTs after its incorporation into DNA, so this is a replication-dependent action. DNA replication precedes cell division and since Decitabine prevents DNMT from acting, it causes a dilution of methylation prior to each cell division (first the double strand becomes hemimethylated and in the next cycle, fully unmethylated). DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and cancer cells are selected for their ability to survive, passing the CGI hypermethylation at promoters of tumor suppressor genes to the progeny. Decitabine prevents this heritage, by acting as a DNA demethylating or hypomethylating agent and allowing for these genes' reactivation, therefore inducing growth arrest and apoptosis. Malignancies dependent on this CGi hypermethylation, as hematological malignancies, have good responses to therapy with Decitabine. The actual mechanism of action is still unclear.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA methylation is stably transmitted during cell division, that is, is mitotically heritable, mainly because of the action of DNMT1. However, unlike genetic composition, the epigenome is susceptible to changes, hence the great breakthrough in cancer research: this susceptibility allows for its modification by drugs, and these modifications can be passed to daughter cells. There are particular times of increased susceptibility, called sensitive periods. These are characterized by the establishment, rather than the maintenance of the epigenetic marks. The two major sensitive periods are the early development and early post-implantation period and the primordial germ cell (PGC) development period, but there are other particular times for sensitivity for different tissues, which allows for differentiation. Changes in the epigenetic profile during these periods will have late effects: the maintenance of altered epigenetic marks my influence disease susceptibility in certain cell lineages, years later, and alterations during PGC development may influence the next generations, through a transgenerational effect (which implies the affectation of at least three generations after exposure). So, during these periods, it wouldn't be advisable to treat patients with drugs that affect the epigenome.</p></div>
