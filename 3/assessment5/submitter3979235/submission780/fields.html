    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in DNA methylation in cancer include a general genome-wide loss of DNA methylation in areas like repetitive elements or intergenic regions, and also a regional gain of DNA methylation, particularly in CpG islands.  CpG islands are areas with high numbers of CpG dinucleotides, they often occur at gene promoters.  In normal cells CpG islands are generally hypomethylated.  When CpG islands are methylated this is associated with gene silencing, as in X inactivation.  In cancer CpG islands often are hypermethylated, which causes the silencing of the underlying gene.  This can lead to disease when the genes being silenced are tumor suppressor genes, whose function in cells is to stop uncontrolled cell growth that can lead to cancer.  This hypermethylation of CpG islands is often seen in tumor cells, and is more frequent than genomic mutations.  It also progresses with time, with CpG island methylation increasing as the cancer grows.  In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells tend to be methylated, while in cancer cells this methylation is lost.  Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are thought to be silenced through methylation to defend the genome against transposable elements zipping around and wrecking havoc.  A decrease in methylation and therefore regulation of this portion of the genome can cause disease because of an increase in genomic instability, which can result in illegitimate recombinations, transpositions, insertions, and deletions.  These genomic mutations can cause inappropriate activation of genes through misplaced promotors or silencing of genes though disruption or transcriptional interference.  In general cancer cells have the opposite DNA methylation profile of normal cells, with hypomethylation in repetitive elements and intergenice regions, and hypermethylation at CpG islands in gene promoters, which can result in both aberrant overexpression or loss of function of genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting disruption can result in cancer through overexpression of a growth promoting protein such as Igf2.  Expression of the genes of the H19/Igf2 cluster is controlled via DNA methylation of each allele's imprint control region (ICR).  When the ICR is unmethylated, as on the materal allele, an insulator protein called CTCF can bind to it, which prevents downstream enhancers from interacting with Igf2, silencing its expression.  Instead a long non-coding RNA called H19 is expressed.  If the ICR is methylated, as on the paternal allele, CTCF can't bind the ICR, and the enhancers are free to interact with the Igf2 gene to drive its expression.  Thus Igf2 is expressed on the paternal allele and silenced on the maternal allele.  In cancerous Wilm's tumor cells, the loss of this paternal imprinting causes the overexpression of Igf2, as both the maternal and paternal Igf2 alleles are methylated.  This allows the enhancers to interact with both Igf2 genes and promote their expression.  This can cause disease because Igf2 is a growth promoting protein, and cells with active maternal and paternal alleles have a double dose of this protein.  Unchecked cell growth and proliferation are hallmarks of cancer, and in this case Igf2 overexpression results in the growth of cancerous kidney tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is in a class of epigenetic inhibitors that act as DNA demethylating agents.  It has been approved by the FDA to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.  Decitabine works by inhibiting the enzyme DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1), which fully methylates hemimethylated DNA following replication.  It is a nucleoside analog, which is incorporated into DNA during replication.  Once it is incorporated into the DNA, decitabine irreversible binds to DNMT, inactivating it, which causes a decrease in DNA methylation in the cell and in subsequent daughter cells.  This inhibitor is replication dependent, and therefore could have a greater effect on cancer cells, as they are rapidly dividing.  In particular it seems to have a very beneficial effect in patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome, a hematopoietic cancer.  This could be due to this cancer being dependent on heavy CpG methylation, and thus incorporation of a DNMT1 inhibitor, particularly in the rapidly dividing cancer cells, could put the brakes on the growth of the cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A defining characteristic of epigenetic changes to DNA is that they are mitotically heritable changes in gene expression (though without a change in sequence), which allows them to have an enduring effect.  An example of this is cytosine methylation, which generally silences gene expression, and is an important epigenetic regulatory control mechanism.  De novo methylation in a cell is done by DNA methyltransferases DNMT3a and 3b, but following DNA replication during cell division, each daughter cell has one strand of methylated DNA and one strand of unmethylated DNA.  It is the job of an enzyme called DNMT1 to locate this hemimethylated DNA and to methylate the unmethylated strand.  In this way epigenetic changes can be stably passed along to all subsequent daughter cells and have an enduring effect.  During some periods of development, called sensitive periods, an altered environment can have a great impact on epigenetic control of the genome.  These periods tend to coincide with the removal and then the laying down of fresh epigenetic marks, and include the period of primordial germ cell development, the production of mature gametes, and the preimplantation and postimplantation period of embryogenesis.  Therefore it would be inadvisable to treat a patient who was pregnant with epigenetic drugs, as they could have profound impacts on the developing embryo.</p></div>
