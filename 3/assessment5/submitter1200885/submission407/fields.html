    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>CpG Island Methylation and Cancer</strong></p>
<p>DNA methylation is brought about by a group of enzymes known as the DNA methyltransferases (DNMT). CpG islands, typically 300-3,000 base pairs in length are found in about 60% of promoters are an exception. The CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. In cancer, there is a gradual increase in the hypermethylation of the CpG islands. The specific CpG islands that are underdo hypermethylation vary with the type of cancer. The hypermethylation of the CpG islands then causes silencing of the underlying gene. This tends to occur in tumor suppressor genes that get silenced disturbing the cells ability to prevent the propagation of tumor cells. Unusually high frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites was termed CIMP (for CpG island methylator phenotype) and was first identified in colorectal cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Intergenic and Repetitive Element Methylation and Cancer </strong></p>
<p>DNA Methylation of Intergenic regions and Repetitive elements is responsible for genomic stability / integrity. The activation of the repetitive elements is known to be mutagenic. In cancer, there is a general hypomethylation of the genome which significantly demythelates the Intergenic regions and the Repetitive elements. This hypomethylation commenced in the first stage of cancer and gradually progresses till metastasis, when it is at the maximum. This hypomethylation will cause the expression / transcription of these Intergenic and Repititive elements contributing to mutations of different types. Gene mutations are the whole mark of cancer and the hypomethylation can lead to additional strikes by causing the following types of mutation:</p>
<ul><li>Transposition of the Repetitive genes to other genes</li>
<li>Mutation of meC to T does not occur thus increasing transposition</li>
<li>These genes have strong promoters that when produced, cause transcriptional interference</li>
<li>The enabling of these repeats allows illegitimate recombination</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 is a gene for a long noncoding RNA and is also called ASM, ASM1 (Adult Skeletal Muscle) and BWS (Beckwith-Wiedemann).</p>
<p>Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted. As the maternal allele is not methylated, the insulator protein CTCF binds to this ICR, blocking the transcription of the Igf2 gene. The downstream enhancers which normally prefer igf2 now loop to their secondary preference of H19.</p>
<p>As the imprinted Paternal allele is methylated, CTCF cannot bind to it causing the enhancers to act on their primary target, promoting the expression of the Igf2 gene. The DNA methylation spreads and methylates the H19 CpG island (adjacent to the ICR) and silences H19 expression.</p>
<p>Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is caused by the maternal allele behaving like the paternal allege (refer figure). This can happen by the following means:</p>
<ul><li>Mutation / deletion causing loss of imprinting</li>
<li>Uniparental disomy where two copies of Chromosome 11 is inherited from the father</li>
<li>Epigenetic disruption (DNA imprinting) which is rare</li>
</ul><p>In this syndrome, the tumor suppressing gene Cdkn1c is not expressed and the growth promoting Igf2 is upregulated. This leads to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">embryonic and childhood tumors including the Wilms tumor (a tumor of the kidney).</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, FDA approved, is a drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes that have progressed to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), a class of conditions where certain blood cells are dysfunctional. Decitabine is a DNA Methyltransferace Inhibitor or DNMTi.</p>
<p>DNMTi is a nucleoside analogues that irreversible bind to DNMT after they are incorporated into the DNA. The action of DNMTi is to demythelate and is dependent on cell replication.</p>
<p>Tumor cells divide much more rapidly as compared with normal cells and they are hence targeted by DNMTi effectively. The proven effectiveness on myelodysplastic syndromes could be due to the fact that they seem to be caused by hypermethylation of CpG islands.</p>
<p>The treatment is effective in small doses during the neo-plastic stage of cancers where DNA methylation takes place. The DNMTi appears to cause DNA demethylation leading to good prognosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At a basic level, DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Hence any changes to DNA methylation have a lasting effect on the epigenome.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods when DNA Methylation is laid down in the DNA. There are two such periods, one being the time just before implantation of the embryo and the other at the time of gamete production as illustrated below:</p>
<p><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-7e775fdc82059f5b23ddb9a1/970238/asst-5/970238-520789aabeb9d6.93232176.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Shortly after fertilization both genomes are demethylated and methylated again starting from the blastocyst stage. During primordial germ cell creation, both alleles are demethylated and methylated again during gamete production.</p>
<p>If treatments targeting DNA methylation are carried out during sensitive periods, methylation marks will not be laid down properly. As  DNA methylation is heritable, changes will be inherited across the developing embryo and the adult (if the embryo survives), and will impact the the grandchildren if it happens in the second sensitive period.</p>
<p>Interfering with the DNA methylation process during the sensitive period is likely to cause far-reaching changes in the epigenome. The impact of demethylation during sensitive periods has been observed in various mammalian studies including the Dutch Famine as well as the Royal Jelly causing the development of queen bees.</p></div>
