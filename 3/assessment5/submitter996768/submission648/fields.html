    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are usually hypomethylated, because they are often found in promoter regions of genes which are usually protected from methylation. Therefore, these promoters are usually active. In cancer cells, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. DNA methylation at CpG islands is almost always an inactivating epigenetic mark, functioning to silence gene expression. This happens because the methylated CpG islands are bound by MeCP1 and MeCP2, which have transcription repressing domains and can also recruit other proteins that condense chromosomes. CpG islands are often found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. so when these promoters are methylated and therefore silenced, the cell loses its tumor suppression ability, leading to formation of tumors.</p>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. Hypomethylated repetitive elements and intergenic regions cause genomic instability. Normally the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated and heterochromatinized and therefore unable to interact with other areas of the genome. However, when they are hypomethylated, they can lead to illegitimate genetic recombination. Normally genetic recombination can only happen in euchromatin and between 2 of the same chromosome because they have similar regions, however, repetitive elements also can be similar to many regions of the genome since they are comprised of repeats, so when they are unmethylated, they can recombine with regions on different chromosomes. Hypomethylation of these regions also can cause activation of repeats, where the repeats can make copies of themselves and then transpose themselves to other areas of the genomes, causing extra insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocations. These transpositions can disrupt coding regions of other genes, or activate neighboring genes that should not be activated, such as oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The maternal allele is normally unmethylated at the imprint control region &amp; H19, while it is methylated at Igf2. When the ICR is unmethylated, it's bound by the insulator protein CTCF, &amp; its binding to the ICR insulates Igf2 from being acted on by downstream enhancers. Instead, the downstream enhancers act on H19 &amp; enhance H19 expression on the maternal allele since they cannot access Igf2. This is an example of chromatin looping - downstream enhancers have a preferred loop between themselves &amp; Igf2, but when that loop is unachievable because of CTCF binding, downstream enhancers loop to H19 instead. The paternal allele is normally methylated (paternally imprinted) at the ICR &amp; H19, while it's unmethylated at Igf2. Since the ICR is methylated, it doesn't bind to CTCF, leaving Igf2 free to be bound by downstream enhancers, enhancing Igf2 expression. Therefore, Igf2 is normally expressed only from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, there's a loss of imprinting &amp; the maternal allele is hypermethylated, leading to expression of Igf2 from both alleles, giving a double dose of Igf2. Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene, so double-expression causes accelerated cell growth &amp; the formation of Wilm's tumor, a childhood kidney tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) and a nucleoside analog which gets incorporated into the DNA during DNA replication in place of a normal nucleotide. Then when a DNA methyltransferase comes to bind to that nucleoside (Decitabine) in order to copy the methylation over to the daughter strand, the DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly to Decitabine and it cannot be released. Over time, this will lower the levels of DNA methylation in a cell, and this happens more quickly if a cell is replicating more quickly, like cancer cells do. Decitabine is approved for use in patients with MDS, which is associated with heavy CpG island hypermethylation and poor prognostic outcomes. Decitabine decreases methylation, which can reverse the hypermethylation of the CpG islands. This can have an anti-tumor effect since CpG island hypermethylation is associated with CIMP tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sensitive periods are periods of development during which the epigenome is undergoing active remodeling. The sensitive periods are the pre-implantation period, the early post-implantation period and primordial germ cell development. Specific organs can also have their own sensitive periods. Young patients that still have developing germ cells should not be treated with these types of drugs, because the germ cells are in a sensitive period of active remodeling. Inhibiting epigenetic machinery during this time would adversely affect the germ cells' ability to lay down the correct epigenetic marks, and could negatively impact the next generation. Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because although epigenetic modifications are reversible, the epigenome is not being constantly modified. Outside of the sensitive periods, the epigenome is in a period of maintenance. So if DNA methylation is changed outside of these times, it will not be easily or quickly changed back.</p></div>
