    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the DNA. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a normal cell, the CPG islands are hypomethylated.  This allows tumour suppressor genes to be expressed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cancer, the CPG islands tend to be highly methylated, whilst the rest of the genome is hypomethylated.   This silences tumour suppressor genes, allowing tumour growth.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are highly methylated.  This contributes to genomic stability, and helps prevent deletions, insertions and translocations.  In addtion the chromatin is tightly packed (heterochromatin).  </p>
<p>In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.  This leads to genomic instability.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the maternal allele, the imprint control region is unmethylated.  This allows binding of CTCF, an insulator protein.  This protein insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers.  These downstream enhancers would preferentially affect Igf2, but because these enhancers are blocked from Igf2, they work on H19 instead.  Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the paternal allele. the imprint control region is normally methylated.  This means that CTCF doesn't bind here, and there is no insulation of Igf2.  This means that the downstream enhancers work on Igf2 instead of H19.   The DNA methylation at the imprint control region spreads downstream  to the H19 promoter, which becomes methylated and is silenced.  Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, there is hypermethylation at the imprint control region.   This means that there is no binding of CTCF at the ICR in the maternal allele and therefore Igf2 is not insulated.  This means that the downstream enhancers work on Igf2 and so Igf2 is expressed.   This means that Igf2 is being expressed from both the maternal and paternal alleles, a double dose. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease because Igf2 promotes growth, and a double dose will lead to excess growth.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  It will reduce DNA methylation.  Cancer can cause genome-wide hypomethylation.  Hypomethylisation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability, with insertions, deletions and translocations.  Decitabine could reverse this effect by methylating these regions.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation could have enduring effects on the epigenome at sensitive periods of development.  These periods occur in the development of germ cells, and shortly after conception.  The resetting that happens during these times allow for lasting changes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In particular, the future of offspring of newly pregnant women and of growing children are susceptible.  Treatments carried out on these future parents may cause changes in the offspring.  </p></div>
