    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the DNA is not methylated, or hypolated, at the CpG islands  however, the genome is methylated in the repetitive elements throught the intergenic regions and even in the introns of the genes.</p>
<pre>In a cancer cell, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated Than a normal cell, while it is hypomethylated in its repetitive elements throughout the     genome.  So, it as if the methylation locations have be swapped, or reversed,    between a normal cell and a cancer cel.</pre>
<pre>The CpG islands are in the promoters of suppressor genes.  So the cancer cells has turned of the tumor suppressor genes.</pre>
<pre>As the tumor progesses over time you find increased methylation in the CpG islands   But there is also increased methylation in the DNA of the genome over time, as we age.  </pre></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<div>  It might be hypermethylation </div>
<div>
<div>in some instances., and hypomethylation in other imprint </div>
<div>control regions. In the IGF2 H19 cluster, the imprint control region, it's  methylated on the paternal allele, and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. </div>
<div> </div>
</div>
<div>
<div>When it's unmethylated CTCF 4 bind is an</div>
<div>insulator element, the </div>
<div>enhancers will act on H19. </div>
<div>But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal </div>
<div>allele, so we don't see expression. </div>
<div> </div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>On the paternal allele, because it is </div>
<div>methylated, the enhancers can act on IGF2, because CTCF is not </div>
<div>binding to intulate this, and IGF2 is </div>
<div>expressed from the paternal allele.  With  loss of imprinting you have high permethylation </div>
<div>of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. </div>
<div>   On the maternal allele, you also </div>
<div>have expression of Igf2. </div>
<div>Now you get a double dose of Igf2 in </div>
<div>comparison to what you saw in a normal </div>
<div>cell. Igf2 is growth promoting, and it</div>
<div>is this that is associated with Wilm's tumour. </div>
<div>This is the  particular childhood kidney </div>
<div>genome that is observed.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that is a DNA-demethylating agent.</p>
<p>it is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, precursors to acute myelogenous leukaemia.  The amount of histone methylation is reduced. It is a histone-deacetylase inhibitor, used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.</p>
<p>It might slow the growth of a tumor directly, or by a secondary mechanism, after treatments with the drug, the standard chemotherapy regime has a much better effect, possibly due to the drug making altered tumor cells more susceptible to the standard chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation can be transgenerational, as seen from studies of the effects over generations in mouse studies and from observations in human studies.  Apparently, not only can epigenetic changes occur to the developing fetus through the feeding, or environment, through the placenta, but the germ cells in the fetus. An also be affected, carrying down to not just the daughter, but Lso the granddaughter.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control.these are the periods when the development is most sensitive to the environment.</p>
<p>One sensitive period is from the development of the primordial germ cells until the gamete is formed.</p>
<p>The second is a post-implantation period, during the development of the embryo, up to the development of the epiblast. These are active remodeling times of the epigenetic programming, where some marks are erased and others are laid down.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would allow the drug access to a much wider range of locations in the genome to have an effect, delivering a shotgun blast instead of a directed change.  There could be just too many unintended consequences from a drug administered during one of these periods.</p>
