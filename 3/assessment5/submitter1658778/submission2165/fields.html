    <h1>Submission 2165 from Anon (session_user_id: f4b0ba6e02f0998ea474a59265b665844c0e629e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine  or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine is a drug that discovered by a Japanese company called Eisai and is an analog  of deoxycytidine and a prodrug that has to be activated by photophosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase. It promotes DNA hypomethylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Specifically, Decitabine is an S phase specific agent. The incorporation of Decitabine in place of 5-methylcytosine in DNA leads to inactivation of DNA methyltransferase due to covalent bond formation between the 5-azacytosine ring of Decitabine and this enzyme. The end result of this process is hypomethylation of DNA. Genes that are silenced by aberrant DNA methylation can be reactivated by treatment with Decitabine. It is obsereved that both leukemic and tumor cells are very sensitive to the antineoplastic action of low concentrations of Decitabine as it is stated by Momparler (2013). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The current theory is that the mutated genes ‘set up’ downstream abnormalities in the epigenome. The downstream genes affected by these epigenetic abnormalities are generally wild-type for the underlying DNA sequence. Thus, normal function might be restored since, theoretically, reverting the software package of epigenetic abnormalities should be easier than repairing the hard drive that harbours the upstream mutations. Epigenetic agents can function predominantly as mediators of a cell reprogramming effect to inhibit cancer initiation and progression. Furthermore, epigenetic agents are useful when used either alone or in combination to sensitize tumour cells to cytotoxic agents or to slow or reverse resistance to other targeted approaches. A sensitive period is usually known as a short period of some days postnatal. It is not advisable to treat patients in this period because there are evidences that DNA methylation patterns and gene expression can be modified.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The modification of the C5 position of the cytosine base (5 mC) is found in approximately 70–80% of CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells and to some extend in non-CpG sequences in embryonic stem cells (ESC). In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Most of the imprinted genes are arranged in clusters (imprinted domains) and each cluster is under the control of an ICR<span>2 </span>and often contains noncoding RNAs that are silenced according to their parental origin. These RNAs can be broadly classified into long noncoding RNAs and short regulatory RNAs (small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs). <span>ICR1 regulates <em>IGF2 </em>and <em>H19 </em>monoallelic expression,<span> </span>leading to <em>IGF2 </em>transcription from the paternal and <em>H19 </em>from the maternal allele. Expression of these two genes is controlled by differential and coordinated methylation of ICR1, DMR2 and the <em>H19 </em>promoter,<span> </span>constituting a parentally-inherited epigenetic trait. </span>On the paternal allele, DNA methylation prevents CTCF binding and is permissive for <em>IGF2 </em>gene activation. The methylation status of the sixth binding site within ICR1 was found to be most consistently associated with the transcriptional status of both <em>IGF2 </em>and <em>H19.</em></p>
