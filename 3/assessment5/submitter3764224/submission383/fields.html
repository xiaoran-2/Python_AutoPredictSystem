    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of DNA at CpG islands normally serves to repress transcription. DNA methylation at CpG islands may increase in cancer while genome-wide DNA methylation may decrease. An increase in methylation at CpG islands regulating tumor suppressor genes would repress their transcription, and thus de-repress tumor formation. Methylation of DNA intergenic and repetitive regions is thought to maintain genome stability, decreasing transcription from transposable elements and other repetitive regions. Though there may be regions of increased methylation (at CpG islands), cancer genomes appear to be de-methylatied globally when compared to normal cells which occurs largely in intergenic and repetitive regions (which far outnumber protein coding genes and CpG regulatory elements). Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can result in genome instability- chromosomal translocations, and segmental deletions or duplications may occur which further disrupt the regulatory architecture of the genome of a cancer cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the ICR element is methylated, the CTCF insulator does not bind, and thus the distant transcriptional enhancers increase transcription of the IGF2 gene on the opposite side of the ICR element. In the maternal allele, the ICR element remains unmethylated allowing the binding of the insulator CTCF protein which directs the distant transcriptional enhancers to transcribe the H19 lncRNA and thereby represses the enhancers further. In the Wilm's tumor pre-cancerous state referred to by Dr. Blewitt, the maternal ICR element is not methylated. Maternal de-repression of IGF2 in Wilm's tumor results in a dosage increase of IGF2, which is gene promoting growth and thus contributing to tumor growth.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent which functions by inhibiting DNA-methyltransferase.</p>
<p>Decitabine results in a decrease in DNA methylation in rapidly dividing cells.</p>
<p>Decitabine may allow normal expression of aberrantly repressed tumor suppressor genes, which may slow tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the definitions of epigenetic DNA alteration (though not a dogmatic one) is mitotic heritability. For example, if an aberrantly methylated tumor suppressor in a myelodysplastic syndrome is de-repressed by Decitabine, this change is inherited by all the daughter cells. If all the daughter tumor cells inherit an epigenetic change which impacts cell survival, this could change the susceptibility of the daughter cells to chemotherapy. A sensitive period might include any time when epigenetic changes occur on a systematic genome wide scale as in the blastocyst during early stages of development and during the formation and maturation of germ cells in development and later childhood/early adolescence. Use of "epigenetic drugs" during early pregnancy might render the embryos non-viable, or if used during periods of germ cell formation/maturation render the recipients infertile. However a significant number of available chemotherapeutic agents have significant reproductive toxicities, which are typically weighed against the benefits to the patient. A number of "preservative therapies" such as egg or sperm capture, to protect the reproductive capacity of younger patients with cancer. These preservative therapies may be necessary for patients treated with epigenetic agents during so-called "sensitive periods". </p></div>
