    <h1>Submission 1212 from Anon (session_user_id: bf25fe3e7ea65ac4092b1b41cd48ad815518aca5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analog that can be incorporated into the nucleus. Decitabine can bind irreversibly to the DNA methyltransferase during cell division and therefore reduce the level of methylation in the daughter strands. Some type of cancers shows hypermethylation at some CPG-island, which would contribute to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes or growth restricting genes, or overexpression of growth promoting genes. DNA methyltransferase inhibitor like Decitabine can reduce the level of DNA methylation by targeting DNMTs, hence exerting its anti-tumor effect.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG island is generally associated with gene silencing, since CpG islands are often found at the promoter area of genes. This silencing effect is achieved by either recruiting repressive chromatin structure at methylated CpG island, or preventing transcription factors from binding. DNA methylation at CpG island is also found to be involved in the X inactivation in female.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, the CpG islands are often found hypermethylated. CpG islands are often found at the promoter of tumor suppressor genes, hence the hypermethylation at CpG islands would result in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. The pattern of hypermethylated CpG islands varies between different cancers. The cancer cells that obtain this kind of epimutations will gain advantage over normal cell such as rapid growth, resistant to programmed cell death, etc. These would allow the cancer cells to survive and eventually take over normal cells in tissue.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps to maintain genomic integrity. In the intergenic regions, DNA methylation helps to maintain genomic stability and silence the cryptic transcription to avoid transcriptional interference; In the repetitive elements, DNA methylation prevents transposition and illegitimate recombination from happening.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, a genome-wide hypomethylation can be observed. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements that are normally methylated become unmethylated. As these areas are normally methylated and densely packed into heterochromatin, the loss of methylation will turn those heterochromatin into euchchormatin which would allow illegitimate recombination to take place. Hypomethylation of repeats can also activate their expression and give rise to transposition, causing disruption of genes or transcriptional interference. In conclusion, hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repeats would lead to genomic instability which may further develop into cancer.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/lgf2 cluster consists of one copy of lgf2 gene, an imprint control region(ICR), one copy of H19 gene and enhancers.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the ICR of H19/lgf2 cluster is unmethylated. An insulate protein, CTCR, will bind to the ICR and prevent the downstream enhancer from acting on lgf2. The enhancers will instead act on H19 gene. H19 gene is hence expressed and produces a long non-coding RNA.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, however, the ICR is methylated and CTCR can no longer bind. Therefore the enhancers will act on lgf2 gene and activate its expression. As a result of DNA methylation spreading, the H19 gene on the paternal allele will also be methylated and thereby silenced.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, the ICR of H19/lgf2 cluster on the maternal allele is methylated. Therefore on the maternal allele, the enhancers are able to act on lgf2 and activate its expression just like what is happening on the paternal allele, and H19 gene is silenced due to DNA methylation spreading. Thus there will be two copies of lgf2 gene being expressed. Since lgf2 is a growth promoting gene, overexpression of lgf2 would result in Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have a long-lasting effect since the methylation marks on DNA are copied to its daughter strand by DNMT1 during each cell division. This ensures that DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of time when environment can have an impact on the epigenetic outcome. There are two sensitive periods during development. One is the period when primordial germ cells develop into mature germ cells, the other one is pre-implantation and early implantation period. In sensitive periods, the epigenome undergoes reprogramming and remodeling of epigenetic marks. Thus, treating patients during sensitive period with epigenetic drugs would be inadvisable because this may interfere with the normal reprogramming of epigenetic marks and may produce unwanted side effects on patients themselves or their offsprings.</p></div>
