    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands results in alterations in the expression levels of genes. Majority of CpG islands in the promoter region is not methylated sothat the gene can freely express. But, in repetitive regions of the genome, CpG islands are methylated especially in transposable elements which are parasitic and jump from one location to another in the genome causing genome instability. CpG island methylation increases from normal tissues to neoplasia stage during cancer.In cancer cells, promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated which causes silencing of the underlying gene. While there is locus specific hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes, there is genome wide hypomethylation of repetitive regions, CpG poor promoters. Thus, tumour suppressor genes are silenced in cancer. It is recognised that DNA methylation can be one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and epimutations are rapidly selected, it is carriedforward during cell division. While in normal cells, there is hypermethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, cancer cells show hypomethylation in these regions. This helps normal cell from stopping transposon activity in the genome.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>While the paternal allele expresses in the normal cell, alteration in DNA methylation at imprint control region can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, The maternal Igf2 gene is silent in a normal  cell. In Wilm's tumour, hypermethylation of ICR results in Igf2 overexpression causing the Wilm's tumour.Because of maternal expression double dose of Igf2 causes Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to inhibitors of DNA methyl transferases which are DNA-demethylating agents. The impact of Decitabine is that it irreversibly binds DNA methyl transferases after they are incorporated into DNA as they act as nucleoside analogues.They have anti neoplastic effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have lasting effect since they are passed on during cell division to daughter cells and grand daughter cells until they are actively erased. Sensitive periods are those when drug treatment should not be given. Mostly these are two stages one during PGC formation and another during fertilization. Treating patients during sensitive periods can have after effects in the future generation of the progenies.The effect of drugs are carried forward to future generations.</p></div>
