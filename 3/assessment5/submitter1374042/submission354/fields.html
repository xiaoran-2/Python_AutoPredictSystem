    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG island usually carries the promotors of different genes, and DNA methylation at those CpG islands usually leads to their silencing. In the context of cancer these CpG islands contain the prometers of the tumor suppressor genes, which are hypomethylated, and hence expressed, but in case of malignancy, they are hypermethylated and hence the expression of tumor supressor is decreased. In case of repetitive elements, which can potentially cause genome instability via trasposones (jumping genes), DNA is hypermethylated to prevent the over expression of those potentially disruptive intergenic repeat sequences. However, if these intergenic and repetitive sequences are hypomethylated, they start expressing the the protein machinary needed for trasposons to jump across the genome and cause genome instability. This is the other DNA methylation related problem that happens in case of a cancer. This all leads to deletions, insertions and illegetimate translocations and chromosome pairing, that causes tumor suppressor genes to inactivate, or some of proto-oncogenes to activate, leading in tern to carcinogenesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR or imprint control region can be an upstrem or downstream region (usually an upstrem region) of an imprinted gene, that contols the differential expression of the imprinted gene. In case of H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal ICR is hypermethylated that leads to underexpression of H19, which lets the Enhancers to act in Cis manner to activate the expression of Igf2 growth factor, while in case of maternal cluster, ICR is hypomethylated and hence covered by CTCF that allows the H19 expression which prevents the enhancers to activate the Igf2 and this growth factor is not expressed by maternal allele. However, in case of Wilm's tumor, both of the ICRs are hypermethylated leading to biallelic expression of the growth factor Igf2 and hence it leads to uncontrolled growth of renal cells in case of babies causing the Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This epigenetic therapy is amongst the group called DNMTi or the DNA methyltransferase inhibator. This drug causes the enzyme DNMT (enzyme that causes the DNA methylation and leads to the silencing of genes) to inhibit and prevents the DNA methylation. The exact mechanism is still not quite understood, however, it is known that this drug is nucleoside analog and hence dependant on the replication of DNA for action, and hence the rapidly dividing cancer cell is preferentially takes up this drug. It is not clear but can be postulated that these drugs demethylate the CpG promotor islands of tumor suppressor genes that have been silenced in case of cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks remain over the genome for pretty long period as such unless some genomic instructions under the influence of some extrnal/ environmental factor cause them to modify. Moreover, some of the epigenetic marks like DNA methylation can even be retained after the cell replication. These mechanisms make the epigenome directed therapy very effective and enduring and long lasting.</p>
<p>In terms of epigenetics, sensitive period is the duration in developmental life of an organism during which epigenetic marks are being recycled i.e old ones being removed and replaced by new ones. Stressors and other environmental factors are supposed to interact rigorously affect the epigenome in this period. </p>
<p> There are two potentially important sensitive periods in epigenetics, one during the early development at the gastrulation of embryo and secondly during early life of an individual when gametes are being matured in gonads. Any environmental insult that can alter epigenetic marks during this period can has long lasting effects as many of epigenetic marks have long lasting effect as they may be mitotically heritable.So in this seneitive period any such insult must be avoided to prevent long lasting effects. This includes the therapy directed against the epigenetic machinary.</p></div>
