    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are genomic regions that contain a high frequency of CpG sites and are found in about 60% of promoters. While most of the CpG sites in the genome are methylated, the majority of CpG islands remain usually unmethylated during development and in differentiated tissues. <span>In most instances the CpG sites in the CpG islands of promoters are unmethylated therefore allowing the genes to be expressed.</span>However, some CpG island promoters become methylated during development, which results in long-term silencing of the related gene expression. Examples of such naturally occurring CpG island methylation during development are X-chromosome inactivation and imprinted genes.</p>
<p>In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. </p>
<p>The intergenic regions and repetitive genomic sequences are heavily methylated, which prevents chromosomal instability by silencing non-coding DNA and<br />transposable DNA elements. In cancer cells they become hypomethylated, which means a decrease in the epigenetic methylation, resulting in their aberrant activation leading to DNA damage and genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the ICR (imprint control region) of the paternal allele is methylated, thus the transcription factor CTCF cannot bind to the ICR and the enhancer can act on the Igf2 gene and stimulate its expression. The ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated, therefore CTCF can bind to the ICR and cause the enhancer to act on the gene H19, but the gene Igf2 is silenced and there is no expression. In Wilm's tumour, the ICR is hypermethylated, leading to the expression of Igf2. Now there is a double dose of Igf2 in the cell which promotes growth which leads to malignant tumor in the kidneys that typically occurs in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and for acute myeloid leukemia. It is a DNA-demethylating agents and works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. DNA methyltransferases is a family of enzymes catalyzing the transfer of a methyl group to DNA. In cancer cells, those enzymes by mutation can become overactive and methylate histones more than they should be and thus silence the genes they surround, including so-called tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. By enzyme inhibition, Decitabine reduces the proliferation of tumour cells while having no apparent effect on nearby normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The term "sensitive period" means that there is a period during early development, i.e. embryogenesis/gametogenesis, where epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are established rather than maintained. In addition, it means that the environment can have an effect on the epigenome. Moreover, there is another sensitive period termed “slow growth period” which effects transgenerational inheritance and is the time before the start of puberty, when environmental factors have a larger impact on the body (9-12 years in grandfathers, 8-10 years in grandmothers). Altering the DNA methylation during sensitive periods can for example establish X-inactivation, a process by which one of the two copies of the X chromosome present in female mammals is inactivated. The inactive X chromosome is silenced by it being packaged in such a way that it has a transcriptionally inactive structure. Treating patients with epigenetic therapies during sensitive perios could have the effect that changes are passed on to their offspring.</p></div>
