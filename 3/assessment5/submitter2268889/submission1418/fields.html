    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal DNA methylation at CpG islands (which are usually in promoter regions of genes) silences unnecessary genes in different types of cells (i.e. muscle cells express different genes than liver cells) and X chromosome inactivation (dosage compensation in female mammals). DNA methylation of CpG islands in cancer can result in hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation in growth genes (resulting in overexpression of growth at inappropriate times). Hypermethylation of specific CpG islands affects expression of that specific gene; type of cancer varies by type of CpG island hypermethylation (i.e. <em>BRCA1</em> CpG island hypermethylation in breast cancer) and also depends on the stage of tumorigenesis. CpG islands are typically unmethylated whereas intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. Hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements results in genomic instability: insertions, translocations, and deletions. The expression of repeats can activate illegitimate promoters and disrupt normal gene expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, promoters of the <em>H19</em> imprinting control region (ICR) are hypermethylated on the paternal allele, which allows enhancers downstream to activate <em>Igf2 </em>(a growth gene). Whereas the maternal allele has an insulator protein called CTCF which blocks methylation at the <em>H19</em> ICR and allows the downstream enhancers to activate <em>H19</em>. In a patient with Wilm's tumor both the maternal and paternal alleles are hypermethylated at the ICR, thus allowing the downstream enhancers to activate <em>Igf2</em>; this results in overexpression of growth factors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA hypomethylator that works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). Decitabine works on specific cancers (currently used to treat acute myelogenous leukaemia, AML, and myelodysplastic syndromes). The loss of DNA methylation resulting in a suppressive role in tumors suggests that tumor suppressor genes are being hypermethylated in tumors that Decitabine is effective against, rather than hypomethylation of growth and oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, thus all daughter cells will have the same methylation marks as the original cell. DNMT inhibitors become integrated in the DNA (as they are nucleoside analogues to cytidine) and bind to DNMTs permanently. Dosage of DNMT inhibitors is very important as high doses can be toxic, likely due to excessive DNA hypomethylation where it should not be occurring.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are times in the development of an organism when the cells of an organism are cleared of epigenetic marks for growth (pre-implantation) and the development of primordial germ cells. These periods are considered sensitive because the epigenetic marks have been removed and the epigenome is susceptible to environmental factors may introduce novel (and potentially destructive) epigenetic marks on the DNA of the organism or their developing germ cells. It is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because the extent of damage that could be caused to the organism's epigenome is unknown. It would likely have devastating consequences in regards to how DNA methylation marks would be laid down and the corresponding effects on gene expression as a result.</p></div>
