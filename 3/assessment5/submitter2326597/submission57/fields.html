    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG islands are mostly protected from the DNA methylation because if it happens will occur silencing of gene expression. But it naturally happens when the methyltransferases enzymes (DNMT3a and DNMT3b) do the work of methylating the dinucleotides and the DNMT1 mantain the methylation through division. In cases like  X inactivation, the MeCP proteins (1&amp;2) bind DNA and use its transcriptional repression domain to form a repressive chromatin structure as also as recruiting other factors that condense the chromatin. In cancer the CpG islands can be hypermethylated which leads to silencing of tumour suppressor genes and by this mechanism the person can't stop the tumor development contributing to desease. At the intergenic regions the DNA methylation occur to promote genomic stability as well as in the repetitive elements, where happens silencing of repeats. In cancer these regions are not properly methylated, what permits the activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes, probably by the deletion of DNMTt1, which in the end promotes genomic instability, contributing to desease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal pattern of methylation on the H19/Igf2 is shown by a methylated paternal allele which then leads to the expression of Igf2 (because the action of the enhancer on it is permited), while the maternal allele is unmethylated and the insulator CTCF permits the expression of H19, blocking the Igf2 expression. On Wilm's tumor what happen is that the imprinting is lost so the maternal allele is then methylated and is free to express along with the paternal allele, leading to a double expression of Igf2. Having a double expression of growth genes  the tumor will continue to develop and lead to advanced stages of kidney cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belong to the class of DNA-demethylating agents, working as a DNMT inhibitor. This drug act as a nuceloside analogue that binds the DNMT after they incorporated to the DNA, inhibiting the methylation to be maintain through division. As it inhibits the progressing of methylation, it may work in tumors that depends on CpG hypermethylation such as in myelodysplastic syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetics alterations are reversible and this aspect permits a hypermethylation in a cancer, for example, to be changed by a drug and kept as the cells keep on going through division and potencialize the effects even after some time of treatment.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming when the epigenetic marks are "cleared" to be reestablished after sometime. They happen in early development and germ cell development, that's why people in these periods of life should not be treated with these drugs, because it can have effects on germ cells and embryos (which follow the lifecycle).</p></div>
