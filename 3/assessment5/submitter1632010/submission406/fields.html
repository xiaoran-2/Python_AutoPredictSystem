    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of methylation at CpG islands (CGI) is to regulate the gene expression, this regions are present in the promotors and in general CGI are protected from methylation in normal cells, which allow the expression of the gene downstream. The methilation of the CGI repressed the gene expression due to several mechanisms:</p>
<p>a. by the formation of the repressive structure in the chromatin mediated by methylated CpG binding proteins plus other factors, which condense chromatin</p>
<p>b. metC avoid the union of transcription factor needed for gene expression.</p>
<p>In the genome there are genes called tumor suppressors that regulate the growths of the cells for different mechanisms and also oncogenes that helps in cell growth using different strategies. In normal cells the tumor suppressor genes are not methylated and active.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, the tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated, silencing their expression. As methylation is heritable, the hypermethylation of these genes are positively selected, allow the cells growth more quickly and not under control. In contrast, the CpG poor islands are hypomethylated leading to expression of oncogenes.</p>
<p>The quantity of CGI methylation increase in cancer cells from neoplasia to invasion (progress of the tumor). This also increase with normal aging, increasing the cancer risk with age. The hypermethylated island varied among different tumors. This changes can be used for diagnosis (biomarkers), prognosis (metastasis) and treatment (drug sensitivity).</p>
<p> In normal cells, the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated, contributing to genome stability and integrity by avoiding transposition, transcriptional interference and dangerous recombination.</p>
<p> In cancel cells, the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated producing genomic instability and this produce deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.</p>
<p>The hypomethylation can active or repressed genes, depending of the repeats promotors, changing normal gene expression. This hypomethylation also progresses with tumorigenicity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation in the imprint control regions (ICR) not necessary implies silencing. In the paternal allele, Igf2 gene is expressed due to the methylation of  the ICR, the enhancers downstream the ICR drives its expression. The binding of the insulator CTCF  to the ICR is blocked by DNA methylation, which also silence H19 promoter by spreading methylation.</p>
<p> In the maternal allele, the insulator CTCF binds the ICR avoiding the DNA methylation, the long non-coding RNA H19 is expressed and Igf2 is silent due to the lost of enhancers influence. So only one copy of Igf2 is expressed in normal cells.</p>
<p>In Wilm´s tumor the ICR is hypermethylated, which produce the expression of Igf2 from both alleles drived by downstream enhancers and also the silencing of H19 in both chromosomes. There is double expression of Igf2 produce cell overgrowth and tumorigenicity.</p>
<p> The hypermethylation of ICR in maternal allele produce the lost of imprinting and as a consequence some growth restricting genes are lost and some growth promoting genes are over-expressed, such as Igf2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the family of De novo methyl transferase (DNMT) inhibitors, which copy the methylation of one strand in the daughter strand during DNA replication. Is a FDA approved drug for Myelodysplastic syndrome treatment.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly binds DNMT after they bind to DNA, so its action are replication dependent. At high dosis has a very toxic and non-specific effect; but a lower dosis, decitabine avoid the methylation of DNA in a more specific way, however it is not gene specific effect.</p>
<p>Decitavine target the hypermethylated CpG island that are frequently found in cancer cells and reduce their methylation, producing the normalization on gene expression, although the mechanism of action is not clear. It can maybe act by reducing the methylation on promoters of tumor suppressor genes, returning to their expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome due to their mitotic heritability, which means that during DNA replication the methylations will be copied into the daughter strand by the DNMT. This produce that all marks are maintained in all daughter cells. This marks are tissue specific and lead to differentiation during development (along with other process).</p>
<p>The sensitive periods are defined as the times where reprogramming of epigenetic marks occurs, periods where the epigenetic marks are removed and later on fixed it again. The lower levels of DNA methylation are found during this periods.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods of development includes the primordial germ line (PGC) development and pre-implantation period. During this periods, epigenetic marks are more sensitive to environmental changes, which include drug treatment.</p>
<p> Patients during the sensitive periods  would be inadvisable for treatment with drugs that modified the DNA methylation due to the normal pattern of DNA methylation will be affected during the reprogramming period, which can affect not only the future generations ( affecting PGC) but also the cell differentiation and growth.</p></div>
