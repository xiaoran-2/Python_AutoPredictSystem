    <h1>Submission 1896 from Anon (session_user_id: 67c90c4b338b663815223a1b1cc609fe872c5162)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On one hand the paternal allele is methylated and enhancers can act on Igf2 and it is expressed. On the other hand the maternal allele is unmethylated so Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>However when a loss of imprinting happens a high permethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele occurs promoting also the expression of Igf2.  In that case maternal and paternal alleles will both express Igf2 and because Ig2 is growth promoting, it associates with Wilm's tumour.  </p>
<p>These modifications at imprint control regions are important because they seem to be responsible for methylation changes that promote the expression or not of some genes. The Wilm’s tumour is an example that these changes can contribute to disease by changing the expression of genes that actually shouldn’t be expressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors.  By inhibiting DNMT decitabine promotes DNA hypomethylation. Its anti-tumour effect is by blockyng irreversibly the activity of DNMT so it can no longer do its function (promoting hypermethylation). Because it is a drug that is replication dependent (by being incorporated in DNA) it will affect mainly the cancer cells that divide quickly than normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When you have a normal cell, in general, CpG islands are hypomethylated. Usually they are found at the promoters of gene suppressor tumors and they promote gene expression. In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated and this is associated with gene silencing. So being CpG associated with gene suppressor tumors and being hypermethylated the genes won’t be transcribed and thus don’t do their function.</p>
<p>In contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements of DNA are hypermethylated in normal cells and hypomethylated in cancer cells. The consequence hypomethylation if genomic instability and oncogene activation. <br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in DNA methylation include loss and gain of DNA of methylation. Hypermethylation on CpG islands and hypomethylation on intergenic regions and repetitive elements have shown to have an important role in cancer development.  These methylation changes can occur at more sensitive periods. This sensitive periods, embryogenesis/gametogenesis and early in development, are when these changes can have an effect on epigenetic control. At these periods would be inadvisable treat patients with epigenetic drugs because using a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery will possible have an negative effect in the development of the germ cells of the patients.</p></div>
