    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation plays an important role in maintaining the transcriptional silencing. Vertebrate DNA is methylated at carbon 5 of cytosines, which are in the CpG dinucleotide.</p>
<p>CpG dinucleotides  methylated cytosines are those that are distributed along the gene sequence. By contrast, CpG dinucleotides  unmethylated tend to concentrate in regions which are called <strong>CpG islands</strong> (often at promoters of genes). In these islands methylation has a function of controlling gene expression. Thus, if the CpG island is methylated gene expression is silenced and vice versa.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated and several CpG islands are located in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. This hypermethylation timely some tumor suppressor gene leads to gene silencing and consequent loss of function. Eg</p>
<p>- The RB1 gene is frequently methylated in sporadic retinoblastoma.</p>
<p>- Inactivation by hypermethylation of the mismatch repair gene hMLH1 in sporadic colon tumors.</p>
<p>- Gene hypermethylation VHL (Von Hippel-Lindau) in 20% of renal cell carcinomas.</p>
<p>In <strong>intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong> CpG dinucleotides tend to be methylated in normal cells and its function is the maintenance of genomic integrity. However, in cancer there is a genome-wide hypomethylation and this fact leads to genomic instability, such as:</p>
<p>-       Illegitimate recombination between repeats (reciprocal translocation). This occurs because chromatin is much more open than it should be.</p>
<p>-       Activation of repeats and transposition.</p>
<p>-       Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is the epigenetic mark that defines a region as maternal or paternal genome in the zygote. Thus imprinted genes show differential methylation regions. These methylation patterns are established during gametogenesis and kept in the rest of the development.</p>
<p>Igf2 and H19 genes form a reciprocal imprinting cluster, so that Igf2 is expressed only on the paternal chromosome and H19 is expressed only on the maternal chromosome. In both alleles there is an ICR in the middle: unmethylated on the paternal allele and methylated on the maternal allele. </p>
<p>ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated and this region is bound by CTCF, which is an insulator protein. This binding insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers and there is no expression from Igf2 gene from the maternal allele. DNA methylation at ICR on the paternal allele blocks the binding of CTCF. Thus, the enhancers are free for promote Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICR can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. In Wilm´s tumor there is double dose of Igf2 because the ICR on the maternal allele is methylated and CTCF is not allow to bind the ICR. Thus, the enhancers promote to Igf2 in both alleles, but there is no expression of H19.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>                Decitabine belongs to DNMT (DNA demethylating) inhibitors. It is a nucleoside analogue (cytidine analogue) which binds DNMTs after being incorporated into DNA. This binding is irreversible and replication dependent. It is used for the treatment of myelodisplasic syndromes, the precursors of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).</p>
<p>            Decitabine has a demethylation effect, as its name suggests; the higher the dose of the drug, the greater the degree of demethylation. However, high dose not involve greater effectiveness. On the contrary, it reaches a point at which the dose has no specific effect and is toxic to the organism.</p>
<p>            This drug has an anti-tumor effect because is a hypomethylating agent and so CpG islands wouldn´t be hypermethylated. This involves that growth restricting genes wouldn´t be silenced and growth promoting genes wouldn´t be overexpressed.</p>
<p>            This treatment could affect to normal cells, as well but cancer cells will be much more affected because their replication is faster than normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism for regulating gene expression, due to its interaction with the mechanisms that modify chromatin structure. Maintaining methylation patterns also explains that epigenetic modifications are stably inherited after DNA replication. Therefore, alteration of the normal processes of chromatin methylation can disrupt important physiological processes.</p>
<p>As we know, methylation is the molecular basis of the phenomenon of genomic imprinting and is a key mechanism in the regulation of gene expression during early embryonic development and primordial germ cell (PGC) development. These periods are sensitive periods, because there is a reprogramming of the epigenetic marks and then a differential resetting in spermatogenesis and oogenes (in PGC development).</p>
<p>With all the above, one must be very careful with epigenetic treatment. If the patient is in any of the periods mentioned, their pattern of methylation can be altered and the physiological processes that have to happen could be erroneous.  Moreover, this pattern will be inherited wrong to daughter cells and that mistake will live on in those cells. This can cause dysregulation of the cell.</p></div>
