    <div class="field-value"><p>Altered methylation, either locus specific methylation or genome-wide demethylation, are the most common alterations found in cancer, being found in every cancer type studied so far. These changes are important in cancer, not merely for their effects but because they are mitotically heritable, so they are passed down to all daughter cells and thus, act in an additive fashion with other changes resultant from their change and act in concert with other mutations, thus acting as one of the hits noted in the Knudson Hypothesis.</p>
<p>CpG islands are clusters of cytokines and guanine dinucleotides, often located at gene promoters, which tend to be protected from methylation. Methylation of CpG islands results in gene silencing, due to the formation of a repressive chromatin structure by the binding of repressive proteins the blocking effects of the methyl groups on transcription factors. CpG islands in gene promoters vary in their methylation status between cell types; however most maintain an unmethylated state. In cancer, CpG islands located in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated, though the precise genes affected vary by tumour type. The loss of these tumour suppressor genes allows cancers dependent on the loss of these genes to flourish and replicate unhindered. Hypermethylated CpG islands can interacts with other epigenetic alterations, like histone modifications, leading to increased silencing of tumour suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically methylated in healthy cells, this methylation preventing inappropriate recombination between repeats, the activation of repeats and transpositions, the transcription of the secondary strand during primary transcription, and activation of cryptic promoters which can negatively impact upon the function of nearby genes. In cancer, a genome-wide hypomethylation removes the methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, leading to a chromosomal instability which can lead to further DNA damage and furthers oncogenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation status of imprinted genes can often be disrupted in cancer, disrupting the balance of growth factor expression profile. An example of this can be found in the H19/Igf2 gene cluster, where the H19 and Igf2 genes are methylated differently between the paternal and maternal alleles. In the paternal allele, the imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated, preventing the binding of the CTCF protein from binding, allowing downstream enhancers to upregulate the expression of Igf2; the methylated ICR also leads to the methylation of the H19 promoter by heterochromatin spreading, thus preventing its expression. In the maternal allele, the ICR is left unmethylated, allowing the binding of the CTCF protein. This CTCF binding insulates Igf2 from the effects of the downstream enhancers, which instead upregulate expression of the H19 gene, which is also left unmethylated due to the absence of methylation at the ICR. In Wilm’s tumour, a hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele causes it to act like the paternal allele, preventing CTCF binding and allowing methylation of the H19 gene promoter, thus blocking expression of H19 and enhancing expression of Igf2 on both alleles. This double dose of growth enhancing Igf2 and absence of any growth suppressing H19 leads to an excess of growth enhancing signal and thus, overproliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferases inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into the DNA of replicating cells and when a DNA methyltransferases comes to add a methyl group to it, the enzyme is bound irreversibly, thus preventing the enzyme from acting upon any other parts of the genome. It is thought that its mode of action in cancer is that in cancer types that are dependent upon the hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes, by binding the methyltransferases enzymes at the nucleoside analogue, the enzyme can’t methylate and silence tumour suppressor genes, and thus these genes can exert their anti-tumour effects unhindered. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs altering DNA methylation can have lasting effects beyond simply the period of drug treatment since, because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the alteration of methylation status by the drug can be passed along to daughter cells of the affected cells and thus, continue to impact upon the behaviour of those cells. This could make the cancer cells more susceptible to standard chemotherapeutics, since for example tumour suppressor genes may be methylated appropriately and thus act in concert with standard chemotherapy, or there may be genome-wide methylation at normal levels, allowing greater genomic stability which may dovetail with the activity of chemotherapy. There are concerns however, precisely because the drug treatments have impacts beyond the time treatment is occurring, since there are sensitive periods during which modification of the epigenome can be particularly impactful. During early embryo development, the parent genomes are demethylated, actively for the paternal genome and passively by the maternal genome, and thereafter remethylated, while during primordial germ cell development the genome is actively demethylated and thereafter differentially remethylated in spermatogenesis and oogenesis. Since demethylation and methylation is so active during these periods, it would be inadvisable to utilise a drug that non-specifically targets methyltransferases and demethylases enzymes since the epigenetic reprogramming would be affected. </p></div>
