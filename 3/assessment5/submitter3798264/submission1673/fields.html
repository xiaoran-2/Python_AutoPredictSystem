    <h1>Submission 1673 from Anon (session_user_id: f57af5253697442469170a4bbea6f241e7db81f9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <span>DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It decreases the efect of the enzymes that methylate the DNA and therefore decreases methylation. A lower methylation usualy leads to an improved expression of genes. Expression of onco-suppressor genes will regulate the lifespan and division of the tumor cells making possible the reset to the normal values and re-establishment of the normal function of the cells. Tumoral tissue will become normal tissue.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During the mitosis of the cell, the DNA methylation tends to be duplicated. If the metrics of the methylation change in a cell, the same configuration will be present in subsequent couple of cell "generations". A change in methylation (e.g. by administration of methyl donors) is not advisable during sensitive periods such as during pregnancy or during early years up to adulthood. </p>
<p>During pregnancy there are two very sensitive moments when the epigenome is reprogrammed: one for the whole embryo and another for the gametes of the embryo. A change in methylation during preganancy would affect the mother but also the child and also the future child of the child (third generation). During childhood there is also a longer sensitive period (arguably of lesser effect) in wich the gametes are not yet fully developed and a manipulation of the methylation will have effects on the future generation. In other words: the methylation may influence trangenerational epigenetic inheritance and can produce unknown/undesirable effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in methylation levels have been observed and are used as signatures of cancerous cells. There have been observed the following telling differences:</p>
<p>CpG islands are hypermetylated in cancerous cells. In the mammalian cell the DNA already has a lower percentage of CpG sequences because this link is not as stable. Instead we encounter the CpG sequence with predilection inside gene promoters. A methylation of the promoter usually leads to silencing of the gene. Therefore cancerous cells have many normally-expressed genes silenced. In addition the methylation of CpG ecourages point mutations.</p>
<p>Equally, the cancer cells have less methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive sequences. These regions are usually heavy methylated in the attempt to silence transposons and control repeats. An abundance of expression of repeats will involve decreased stability of the DNA due to deletions, translocations, and insertions. Instability is further increased by the activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes.</p>
<p>There are also cases when poor CpG promoters are hypomethylated in the cancer cell and that may lead to the exression of oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer can follow a disruption of imprinting. For example in the normal cell the paternal allele is methylated at the H19/Igf2 cluster's ICR. That leads to a spread of methylation to H19 promoter and facilitates the action of enhancers on Igf2. Conversely, on the maternal allele, ICR is not methylated and H19 is expressed because the existence of CTCF insulator protein that is able to link to a unmethylated ICR locus. The enhancers will prefer to activate H19 instead of Igf2.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm's tumor there is a over-expression of H19 that is an oncogene. This can take place mainly because the paternal allele remains unmethylated at the ICR and acts the same as the maternal allele, thus the cell will be producing a double quantity of H19 and no Igf2.</p></div>
