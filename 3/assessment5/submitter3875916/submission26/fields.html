    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a process which involves the addition of a methyl group, altering the expression of genes. It is critical for normal development and changes in this process can lead to many diseases, such as cancer.</p>
<p>CpG islands are regions situated in the genome with a high frequency of CpG sites. In normal cells, CpG islands are usually unmethylated, allowing gene expression. Otherwise, in cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated, resulting in transcriptional silencing. In fact, hypermethylation of CpG islands has been described in almost every tumor type. When hypermethylation occurs in CpG islands located in the promoter of tumor suppressor genes (genes that regulate cell division and growth), it results in the silence of this genes, and thus, cell division becomes unregulated, promoting the development of the tumor.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions are stretches of noncoding DNA between genes. In normal cells, this regions are usually methylated, maintaining genomic integrity, since it prevents abnormal karyotypes due to genomic instability (such as deletions, translocations or insertions). It also silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites, preventing transcription interference.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements are found in multiple copies throughout the genome. One example of a repetitive element is the transposon. Transposons are DNA sequences that jump out and paste themselves into somewhere else in the genome. This process could be mutagenic, since a transposon can insert itself into a functional gene or its promoter can read out into downstream genes which shouldn’t be transcript. Therefore, to prevent it to occur, repetitive elements are usually methylated. Methylation of repeats may also prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, both intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. The methylation in these regions increases the genomic stability. Thus, in cancer cells, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">There are some genes that show monoallelic expression based on the parent-of-origin of the allele<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>through a process known as genomic imprinting. However, disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer due to alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs, which can result in a loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. An example of this is the <em><span>H19/Igf2</span></em><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>cluster. At the paternal allele, the imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated, blocking CTCF (an insulator protein) of binding. Thus, DNA methylation spreads to the promoter of the gene<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em><span>H19</span></em>, silencing him, and enhancers activate the gene <em><span>Igf2</span></em></span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">. On the other hand, at the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, whereby, CTCF binds to the ICR, activating the gene<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em><span>H19</span></em></span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">, which insulates<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em><span>Igf2</span></em><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>from downstream enhancers, silencing the gene <em><span>Igf2</span></em></span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">. However, in some cases, there are hypermethylation of ICR, which leads to overexpression of the gene <em><span>Igf2</span></em> (this gene will not be imprinted and will be active in both maternal and paternal alleles) inducing Wilm’s tumour. Disrupting imprinting at the<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em><span>H19/Igf2</span></em><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>cluster contributes to Wilm’s tumour since the gene <em><span>Igf2</span></em><span class="apple-converted-space"><em> </em></span>is a<em><span> </span></em>growth promoting gene.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one drug affecting epigenetic processes that is already in the market. This drug belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors (DNA-demethylating agents) and it is sold by a Japanese company. Although large amounts of Decitabine can become toxic (and nonspecific), in appropriate amounts, this drug is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. It is a nucleoside analogue, binding irreversibly to DNMTs (DNA methyltranferases), leading to demethylation of DNA. Thus, Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect, since tumor suppressor genes (which, due to hypermethylation of CpG islands, were methylated before, and, consequently, inactive) remain active, restoring control of cell division and growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, since it is a very stable epigenetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent cell generations. Therefore, drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>However, there are some sensitive periods, which are periods of epigenetic reprogramming, in which there are clearing and remodeling of epigenetic marks (such as DNA methylation) during development, allowing to restore totipotency of the newly formed embryo. In early life, there are more sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, epigenetic reprogramming occurs during primordial germ cell development and early development.</p>
<p>Despite enduring effects of drugs, treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable, because epigenetic drugs will prevent the normal process of epigenetic reprogramming and alteration of the normal process result in epigenetic abnormalities, mainly aberrant imprinting.</p></div>
