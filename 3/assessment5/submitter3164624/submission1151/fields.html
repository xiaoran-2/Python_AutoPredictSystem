    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated and intergenic regions and repetitive elements are mainly hypermethylated. The lack of methylation at the CpG island will allow expression of the following gene. However, if the CpG island is methylated the expression of the gene will be silenced and, if the gene is a tumour suppressor, then this can contribute to cancer by allowing te growth of tumours.</p>
<p>If the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which are normally hypermethylated, become hypomethylated, this can lead to instability, such as illegitimate recombinations and deletions or insertions in chromosomes. So, this hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is generally seen in cancer cells. The lack of methylation leads to more open chromatin (euchromatin) which allows this instability to happen.</p>
<p>If tumour suppressor genes are silenced by CpG island hypermethylation, then the cells will grow more rapidly and this epimutation will increase by being selected for.  </p>
<p>So, in summary: increasing methylation can contribute to cancer if it happens in CpG islands and silences a tumour suppressor gene; increasing methylation can work against the development of cancer, if it happens in intergenic regions or repetitive elements and avoids illegitimate recombinations, deletions and insertions in chromosomes. Therefore, whether methylation is a good or bad thing depends on which of these mechanisms is at work and also on the stage of the tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Imprint Control Region(ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal. So, the allelles are different according to parent-of-origin – this is imprinting. There are enhancers in this region, which can act on genes further back along the genome specifically igf2.</p>
<p>However, in the maternal allele enhancers act on H19 but cannot act on the igf2, which is further back, as the ICR (being unmethylated) blocks them from doing so. Whereas, on the paternal allele, as the ICR is methylated it does not block the enhancers and they can act back on the igf2 and cause it to be expressed.</p>
<p>With loss of imprinting, the ICR is methylated in the maternal allele as well and so igf2 is expressed in that, leading to expression of 2 igf2s. As igf2 is growth promoting, expression of it in both alleles produces Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DMTi) and therefore restricts the methylation of DNA. So a DMTi causes DNA demethylation. This means that if DNA methylation would have silenced a tumour suppressor gene, it will not do so if a DMTi has been used.</p>
<p>The DMTI binds to DNMT after incorporation into DNA  and therefore remains, as cells divide. As it’s effect is locked into the cell and epimutations are mitotically heritable it is effective on dividing cells. Cancer cells divide a lot more than normal cells and, so, it is particularly effective at limiting growth of tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, so those changes are passed on to daughter cells in mitosis. Thus, if a drug caused reduction of DNA methylation or histone acetylation, then those features would also be reduced in future generations of cells. This could mean that the tumour cells are altered in some way, such that in the future they would be more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a time in the life of the individual when the use of epigenetic drugs could have undesirable long-term effects. Such a time would be in early life at the stage of primordial germ cell development, as this could cause changes in the epigenetics of germ cells which could be passed on to the individuals of the next generation.</p></div>
