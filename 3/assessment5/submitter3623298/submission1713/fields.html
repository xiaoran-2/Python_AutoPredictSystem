    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint can be associated with DNA methylation at the ICR. ICR  can be methylated either paternal or maternal side but no in both in normal cell,consequences will be different depending of the cluster, father with ICR methylated mean mother unmethylated,this unm ICR in mother bound to CTCF protein preventing enhancer to act on IgF2(insulation effect) then enhancer act on H19 promoter enhancing h19 expresion. for the other side paternal allele is methylated at ICR thas mean not CTCF bound not insulation action on IgF2 so enhancers act over IgF2 promoting expresion of it  from the paternal allele so we have it imprinted.this can also spread on paternal h19 silencing it .</p>
<p>When loss of imprinting  you can have  hipermethylation in mother allele too,means both IgF2 (mother and father) are expressed now you have double dose of IgF2 promoting abnormal incontrolable growth, this is associated with  possible patogenesis of Wilm's Tumor .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dna methylation happens when adding a methyl group to Dna at Cytosine base that normally pair with Guanin-CpG dimucleotide),they are found at a place called CpG island on promoter on gene. In normal cell CpG island are unmethylated,methylation of CpG islands means silencing of the gene expression however some CpG island can me methylated example in X inactivation,,There are few CpG island on Genome due DNA methylation is mutagenic.Otherwise the  intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in the normal .They help to mantain genome stabilty and integrity, Intergenic region exhibit DNMT1 activity if not deletions,translocations etc can be happen.also  they do some silencing of expresion of a cryptic promoter that if not can  provoque  transcription interferences at the gene level.</p>
<p>Repeats Elements also mantain genome integrity been methylated , they make a copy themselves jump out and paste in any place in the genome and this is evidently mutagenic so silencing this  prevent  transposition deletions , ilegimiates combinations etc.</p>
<p>In cancer intergenic regions  and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated.Genome as a whole tend to be hypomethylated.CpG island tends to be hypermethylated at some places, all these infer genomic inestability and loss of integrity.CpG hypermethylated  on the promoter of the tumor supressor gene then is silenced locking it in acyl active state becouse Dna methylation is mitotically hereditable cells more than dying form a chimer.</p>
<p>In cancer you have activation of oncogenes(CpG poor promoters) that promote growth inmortality and continuos divison  and  also you have inactivation of tumour supressor.Hypomethylation of the Repeats and Intergenic intervales provoque abnormal karyotipe due to genomic instability</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a Hypomethylating agent that act inhibiting DNA Methyltranferace</span><span>.It cause hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentation .FDA approved for treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndrome progressive to AML..It is a nuclesoside analog that is incoporated on DNA upon replication then when DNA methyltranferase come along bind it.DNMT1 bind  and copy the methylation to the daugter strand irreversible,it is division dependent so cell needs to be replicating(thats happen in cancer) Recently been used at low doses with very good antineoplasic effect caused by DNA demethylation.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sensitives periods are those when altered envinoments have an effect on epigenic control, There are two specific sensitive periods. The first one  is from of  primordial germ cell development  to the production of mature eggs and sperms.The second one is pre-implantation and post -implantation both are acting remodeling of the epigenomeTreat patient during this pediod will be not recomended due to the effects that can inhibit the epigenetic machinery.</p>
<p>Investigations and medical trials have been showed that becouse combination of these drugs,it had been   improving in treatment of erradication of the tumor, or patient with better tolerance to futures protocols treatment with chemotherapy..Altering Dna Methylation can lead to that this epigenetic mark when passed on during cell division to daugther and further generations can be finally erased witthout recurrence changing of cancer surival prognosis on patients using these novo epigenetic therapies</p></div>
