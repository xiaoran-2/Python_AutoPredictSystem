    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are primarily associated with the promoters of genes and are found in about 60 % of them. The purpose of DNA methylation of the cytosines in those islands is to silence, or more accurately, stabalize the silencing of those genes through transcription factor blocking, chromatin condensaition, etc.. Though silencing has been shown to preceed DNA methylation, without methylation following silencing, the silencing may not last. For example, if DNA methyaltion is inhibited during the process of X chromasome inactivation in the female, X chromasomes will subsequently reactivate in some cells, which otherwise does not occur. Normlly most CpG islands are not methylated, though some does occur during early differentiation of tissues from the zygote on. CpG dinucleotide.methylation of gene bodies is comman in highly expressed genes and may prevent faulty transcription (wrong start site, antisense transcription, etc.) and direct RNA splicing and  replication timing.  Repeats (including parasitic elements such as retrovirus remnants) are commanaly CpG methylated to prevent transcription and expansion, which would destabalize the DNA.</p>
<p>In cancer the above patterns of methylation are stood on their head. There is a marked increase of CpG island methyation, termed CIMP for CpG island methylator phenotype, but an overall loss of genome wide sporadic CpG dinucleotide methylation. The CpGi hypermethylation can be associated with a silencing of tumor supressor genes leading to increased growth, as may CpG shore hypermethylation (associated with gene activation)  of oncogenes. Genome wide hypomethylation can lead to a general destabilazation of DNA, including it's replication, and it's replication timing. Repeat elements can be expressed and enlarged. Gene transcription may begin in ectopic alternative regions or occur in the antisense direction. These epimutations disrupt the normal well modulated metabolic and growth pathways just as gene mutations can and can lead to unchecked growth and cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinted H19/Igf2 locus is arranged in a push pull fashion, with Igf2 upstream of H19, and an imprint control region (ICR) located between the two genes while an enhancer is downstream to both. In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, blocking an insulator CTCF from occupying it. This is associated with methylation of the promoter of the H19 gene, which is silenced. The enhancer is free to stimulate the promoter of the Igf2 gene, which is thus expressed. In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated and is occupied by CTCF, which blocks the enhancer from stimulating the promoter of Igf2, which is not expressed. The promoter of H19 is not methylated, and the gene is transcribed. According to one study, in about 37% of cases of Wilm;s tumor, a childhood kidney neoplasm, there is an epimutation in the maternal allele with methylation of the H19 promoter, so that the gene is not expressed, while Igf2 is. This  leads to a double dose of Igf2, a growth factor, which is presumably a factor in the ultimate genesis of the neoplasm. Under expression of imprinted tumor suppressor genes or overexpression of imprinted oncogenes could cause neoplasms.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA – demethylating agent. It is evidently phosphorolated, incorporated into DNA strands, and inhibits DNA methyltransferase, all this mainly happening in rapidly proliferating cells. Most likely the drug acts on hypermethylated and thus silenced or hypoactive tumor suppressor genes, unsilencing them and leading to greater cell differentiation and decreased growth. In the additional article I read, it was claimed that hypomethylating DNA could also lead to apoptosis in the neoplastic cells. It is used primarily to treat myelodysplastic syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically stable. If a cytosine in a CG dyad in a DNA strand is methylated, along with the C in the opposite strand paired with the G, the same pattern will be maintained after DNA replication. At first only the two original, now separated DNA strands will be methylated at their Cs, but de novo methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) will add a methyl group to the appropriate spot in the newly replicated partner strand to reproduce the original pattern. There are times during development, called sensitive periods, when the epigenetic marks are reset. These occur shortly after fertilization, during early development when much of the slate is wiped clean except for imprinted genes. Epigenetic marks are added as differentiation occurs and development proceeds. A second sensitive period occurs during the development of primordial germ cells, when the appropriate marks are added for male or female gametes. Treatment induced epimutations during these times could have lasting effects on the epigenome because of the mitotic stability of the changes. If treatment occurred during very early development, there would be a real risk of serious birth defects. If treatment occurred during gametogenesis, it might cause infertility.</p></div>
