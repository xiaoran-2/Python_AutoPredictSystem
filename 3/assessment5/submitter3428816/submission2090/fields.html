    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands is symmetrical in the DNA double strand. Methylation patterns of cytosine at CpG islands is conserved during cell division. CpG island usually located at promoter region. Most of the CpG island is unmethylated, but some are methylated by cell differenciation. As for cancer cell, the CpG islands are hypermethylated, i.e., most of the cytosines in the CpG islands are methylated. In the lecture, it is suggested that CpG methylation is often correlated with a more compact structure, as well as blocade of transcription factor binding. Therefore, the gene, promoter of which has the CpG island hypermethylated, would be silenced. In cancer cell, this heavy CpG methylation occurs at promoter regions of tumor suppressor gene. Therefore, the cell would not be able to correct itself or start apoptosis, which are directed by the now silenced genes. And as a result, the cell with altered chromatin survive, and pass both the mutations as well as aberrant methylation down through mitosis.</p>
<p>In normal cells, on the other hand, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements would be methylated to suppress the expression of corresponding genes. Moreover, cytosine methylation is important in checking and correction procedure during DNA replication. Therefore, hypomethylation of these regions in cancer cels would have two effects. One is activation of oncogene. The other is increase of chromatine instability. Overexpression of oncogene enhances rapid proliferation and other pathogenic features. And chromatine instability make the cell more suseptible to mutations, which was rapidly selected, leading to abnormal function, cell necrosis, inflammation, and a varied tumor cell culture ready to develop drug resistance, etc.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent. It inhibites DNA methyltransferase to induce DNA hypomethylation. Therefore, abnormal hypermethylation would be reversed and silenced tumor supressor genes would be reactivated, either to repair the aberrant chromatine, or induce apoptosis in tumor cells. Decitabine is utilized to treat <span> myelodysplastic synodromes. Similar to Azacitidine, which is also a DNA demethylating agent, Decitabine would inhibit cytosine methylation at low dose and kill abnormal marrow cells at high dose.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically conserved. When a cell was treated by DNA demethylation agents, the effect of medication would be passed to its daughter cells, and granddaughter cells, etc. However, demethylation agents would interfere with germ cell and embryo development, by inhibiting correct methylation to occur.  The periods during which the cells have started reprogramming their epigenetic marks would be sensitive. The first period is during germ cell development, when alleles from both parents and imprinted genes are programming their DNA methylation patterns. The second period is during development from blastocyst to epiblast, when alleles from parents are programming DNA methylation patterns. During these periods, i.e. earliest and lates periods during pregnancy, demethylation agents would prohibit correct methylation pattern programming in the embryo or in its germ cells, increasing risk to epigenetic abberance. Therefore, patients in sensitive period are not advisable to take DNA methylation medications.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allel, imprint control region is methylated to inhibit CTCF binding. Therefore, CTCF would not be able to inhibit H19 promotor methylation. As a result, H19 is silenced, and downstream enhancers can enhance Igf2 expression. </p>
<p>In the maternal allele, imprint control region is not methylated. Therefore, CTCF would inhibit H19 promotor methylation. The downstream enhancers would instead bind to H19, and Igf2 expression is suppressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster of the maternal allel is incorrecty methylated, resulting in an overexpression of Igf2, which lead to embroyic or childhood tumor.</p></div>
