    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 is an imprinted gene cluster. H19 and Igf2 are genes whose expression depends on an enhancing sequence on their 3' side. The enhancer's effect is directed/regulated by an imprinting control region. This region (ICR) is a recognizable substrate for binding of CTCF and its co-factors. In the maternal allele it is unmethylated and available for CTCF to bind. This bind most probably physically limits access to the Igf2 gene and promotes enhancer's activity on H19 gene. On the other hand this region is fully methylated on the paternal allele. This DNA mark prohibits CTCF binding and promotes the enhancer's activity on Igf2. Wilm's tumour isn't usually linked to genetic mutations (although there are observed gene mutations in some cases) but to distruption of epigenetic machinery. In this tumor, hypermethylation of the maternal allele ICR site is observed. This forces the maternal allele to act like the paternal one: the enhancer works on the Igf2 gene to promote its expression. This results to Igf2 overexpression and H19 silencing. Igf2 codes for insulin-like growth factor 2, a protein known to contribute to growth in infancy and early age, while H19 codes for a lnc-RNA that is thought to be involved in tumor-suppresing mechanisms. This results to aberrant cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT (DNA methyltrasnferase enzyme) antagonist, it bears resemblance to cytosine much like azacitidine does yet it shows more selectivity for DNA rather than RNA polymerase enzymes. During DNA replication process it is used in DNA strands instead of cytosine. When DNMT then goes on to apply the methylation markings according to the mother strand it gets irreversibly bound to the molecule (this is the normal process driven by DNMT that ensures mitotic heritability of epigenetic marks). The result of this is a block on DNA methylation and as such, DNA hypomethylation in the cell. This action can be helpful in cancer types, where previous hypermethylation of regions in the DNA have silenced a gene whose normal function is the suppresion/regulation of a potential oncogene (thus a tumor-suppressing gene). Since decitabine's effect can salvage the tumor-suppressing gene, allowing it to be transcribed again to some extend, the tumor's growth will be slowed down.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
