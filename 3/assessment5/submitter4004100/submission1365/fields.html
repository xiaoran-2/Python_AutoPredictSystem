    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in many ways in cancer.</p>
<p>CpG islands are often located at promoters of genes. When CpG islands are methylated, they silence the expression of the gene where it is located by forming a repressive chromatin structure, as methylated CpG binding proteins with transcriptional repression domains attach, and these proteins recruit other factors that condense the structure even further. Furthermore, methylated CpG islands can sometimes prohibit transcription factors from binding so transcription is blocked. The methylation profile of these CpG islands is context-dependent as different cells have different genes activated depending on the tissue in which it is found. DNA methylation is also found at intergenic regions in order to maintain genomic integrity by silencing cryptic transcription splice sites, and at repetitive elements to prevent transposition and avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and also to prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer, there is DNA hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes and global hypomethylation, but most especially at repetitive regions and at CpG poor promoters, specifically at the promoters of oncogenes. The result of this is that tumour suppressors are silenced, so they cannot protect the cell from tumorigenesis, and that oncogenes are activated, promoting tumorigenesis. Global hypomethylation results in open chromatin prone to genomic instability, causing translocations, deletions, duplications and insertions. Hypomethylation at repetitive regions leads to activation of repeats, causing transpositions due to transposable elements, as well as the activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p>
<p>This leads to genomic instability. Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer, as an enabling characteristic; the greater the genomic instability, the greater the number of stochastic mutations that can lead to favourable conditions for tumorigenesis. Such conditions can include inflammation, metastasis, resisting programmed cell death, angiogenesis and having replicative "immortality" by being able to replicate indefinitely.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted. The imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele; the ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated. The ICR, when unmethylated, causes allele-specific expression by blocking downstream enhancers that promote the expression of Igf2, as CTCF, an insulator protein, binds to the ICR and insulates Igf2 from the action of the enhancers, silencing the maternal Igf2 allele. When the ICR is methylated, CTCF is blocked from binding and enhancers activate and express the paternal Igf2 allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, imprinting is disrupted in many ways, such that the patient has two H19/Igf2 clusters with methylated ICRs. This can be as a result of a mutation or deletion causing loss of imprinting; uniparental disomy, where two copies of the paternal chromosome is inherited instead of one; or, rarely, a disruption to the epigenome leads to loss of imprinting. These three cases lead to an overexpression of Igf2 as Igf2 is expressed from two alleles rather than just one. Igf2 promotes growth as a growth factor acting as an oncogene so when it is upregulated, tumorigenesis is promoted due to a self-sufficiency in growth factors (sustained proliferative signalling).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a de novo methyltransferase inhibitor and is a nucleoside analogue, incorporated into DNA instead of the usual cytidine containing the cytosine base. Decitabine irreversibly binds to DNMTs, preventing DNMT's action of methylating hemimethylated DNA strands so after several replications, a dilution effect occurs where DNA is hypomethylated as the DNA methylation marks are no longer mitotically heritable. This can lead to tumour suppressors being activated due to the loss of silencing marks, allowing tumour suppressors to activate pathways to prevent tumorigenesis, such as apoptosis or an arrest of the cell cycle. At higher doses of Decitabine, the covalent, irreversible binding of DNMTs prevents DNA synthesis and causes cell death of replicating cells. As tumours generally have a faster rate of replication, tumours are more affected by cell death than healthy cells due to the disruption of DNA synthesis and therefore cell replication, which occurs faster in tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, maintained by DNMTs, which methylate hemimethylated DNA after DNA synthesis. After epigenetic drug treatment, DNA methylation is decreased, and as methylation is usually laid down during two early periods of epigenetic reprogramming (sensitive periods during which the environment has the greatest effect on the epigenome as DNA methylation is cleared and reestablished) and usually are maintained throughout adulthood, DNA methylation does not increase even after the period of treatment as the DNMT cannot add methylation marks to DNA unmethylated on both strands - the portions of the genome previously methylated but lost their methylation due to the epigenetic drugs - the lack of DNA methylation is also mitotically heritable.</p>
<p>Treating patients at sensitive periods of early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development is inadvisable as epigenetic drugs would affect epigenetic reprogramming. Inappropriate setting of epigenetic marks can lead to clinical problems due to inappropriate gene expression, loss of imprinting (possibly leading to imprinting disorders) and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the healthy development of the foetus relies on appropriate gene expression and a healthy epigenomic profile. Another possible candidate sensitive period are slow growth periods possibly linked to transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, although these are not confirmed by rigorous studies.</p></div>
