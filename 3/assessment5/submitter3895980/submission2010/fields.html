    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It binds irreversibly to DNMTs after incorporation to DNA.</p>
<p>Its reverses/prevents the silencing of tumour suppressor genes by inhibiting their hypermethylation. This results in limiting the progression of myelodysplastic syndromes to acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>The organization of DNA into chromatin is highly regulated and essential for producing cell type specific gene expression signatures. The mechanisms for this are interrelated and need to be stably maintained during cell divisions to conserve cellular identity. These epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modification and remodeling, and non-coding RNA. They are responsible for Long-range silencing of repetitive sequences, formation of silent heterochromatin and DNA access for transcription in euchromatin or DNA replication.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. Its occurence at the promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. Exceptions to this are the CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters which are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state.</p>
<p>In cancer cells however, promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, leading to silencing of the underlying gene. Hypermethylation increases with tumorigenicity and relates with poor prognosis</p>
<p>Alterations of epigenetic patterns such as aberrant DNA methylation could arise stochastically due to loss of fidelity or mutation of epigenetic enzymes as evident in aging and by a large heterogeneity in genome-wide methylation patterns of different cancers. This causes genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes resulting in the silencing of tumour suppressor genes by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands </p>
<p>Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been identified at intergenic sites outside protein-coding genes containing H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 domains. They are biologically active and are needed for pluripotency and differentiation. They show aberrant expression in several cancers.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Monoallelic gene expression is an allele specific expression, based on parent-of-origin of the allele. There is differential resetting in spermatogenesis vs oogenesis with rapid and active demethylation of paternal genome and passive demethylation of maternal genome.</p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of ICR and Igf2 overexpression leads to Wilm’s tumour</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Epimutations are rapidly selected.</p>
<p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. </p>
<p>Clearing of epigenetic marks occurs in germ cell development and early embryonic development.</p>
<p>In younger patients and pregnant women caution is advised due to effects of the drugs during these sensitive stages as they may interfere with the process of reprogramming/imprinting.</p>
