    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG island is important in epigenetic control of genes and it’s always associated with gene silencing. Generally CpG island is unmethyalted but some of them are methyalted; varies between stages of development e.g (X inactivation in females) or cell type. Cancer induced by DNA methylation at CpG island is usually characterized by CpG island hypermethylation in the promoter preceding tumor suppressor genes and hypomthylation of CpG island preceding oncogenes and repetitive regions. The direct relationship between CpG island hypermethyaltion and tumorgenesity disrupt the normal situation and then develop to disease. The DNA methylation in intergenic region and repetitive elements provide genomic stability and silence the cryptic transcription. In cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements is hypomethyated thus undergoes genomic instability i.e. (cryptic transcription, activation of transposition and repeats and illegitimate recombination resulted in deletion, insertion and translocation may disrupt genes responsible for cell cycle regulation, tumor supressor genes, or oncogenes and may encounter another factors that helps cancer to devolp) any disruption in the normal gene regulation devolp to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can predispose to cancer because of over expression of gene exist in both alleles but imprinted in one while expressed from another one; may be maternally or paternally imprinted. In H19/Igf2 cluster ICR in the paternal allele is methylated and methylation spreads toward H19 gene. Methylation of ICR prevents the CTCF from binding and the enhancer will act on Igf2 gene to enhance its transcription. The maternal allele ICR is hypomethylated which allow the CTCF protein to bind and prevent the enhancer to reach the Igf2 gene to initiate transcription and enhance transcription of H19 gene. in Wilm’s tumor the ICR is hypermethylated which prevent CTCF from binding resulting in over expression of Igf2 gene (growth factor) thus the concentration of Igf2 is increased  which can trigger the cell to divide  uncontrollably and develop to tumour. mutation play an important role in cancer development in which methylation of parental allele is not founded so the insulator will bind to ICR and prevent inhancer from reach the Igf2 gene, mutation in ICR of the maternal allele prevent insulator to bind so inhancer can reach the Igf2 and increase its concentration.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agents drug, which inhibit methylation in hypermethylated region by inactivate the DNA methyltransferase enzyme and then the tumor suppressor gene can be expressed in normal manner thus the ability to progress cancer is lost.  Decitabine is stated to have antineoplastic activity which is usefull in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and patient with leukemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Hypermethylation and hypomethylation of CpG island and CpG island shores varies between cancer types, it’s a common place knowledge that the DNA methylation is progress with time but the alteration of DNA methylation is  increasing with age of individual . The period at which the genome have normal epigenetic reprogramming is a very sensitive period. During development, each developmental stage may require spesific epigenetic reprogramming and agents that can alter or disrupt the normal epigenetic reprogramming is the particular period is not required so   that, this stages of development is very sensitive to any drug due to the deleterious affect of these drugs on the devolpment thus may also alter the phenotype. </li>
