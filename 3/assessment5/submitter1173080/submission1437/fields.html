    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, intergenic regions are extensively methylated, while CpG islands in gene promoters tend to be hypomethylated. In cancer it is vice versa - CpG islands are hypermethylated, but intergenic regions hypomethylated.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is generally a silencing mark. Demethylated CpG islands in normal cells allow normal transcription of genes needed in particular cell type. These genes specific for a certain cell type are considered as tumor suppressors. In cancer, however, CpG islands in promoters of these genes are hypermethylated which leads to silencing of the cell-type specific, tumor suppressor genes. In cancer it also sometimes happen that CpG-poor promoters of oncogenes, such as r-ras or miR-21, are hypomethylated, allowing expression of these genes that contribute to cancer phenotype. Interestingly, differential methylation of so called CpG shores (regions spanning 2 kb around CpG islands) is also found in cancer and adds to the malignant processes.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions of human genome contain significant amount of repeats and transposable elements that ought to be silenced in order to prevent them to disrupt genome integrity. However, that is happening in cancer, where theintergenic regions tend to be hypomethylated. Specifically, the hypomethylation leads to illegitimate recombination, stochastic transposition or activation of cryptic promoters which all cand lead to aberrant activation or silencing of gene expression, chromosome instability, cell division abnormalities etc. which all contribute to the malignant phenotype.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 is an example of imprinted locus. It is paternally imprinted, meaning that it is methylated on the allele inherited from father.</p>
<p>On maternal allele, the imprinted control region (ICR) is unmethylated and therefore recognized by protein CTCF which acts as an insulator: it prevents downstream enhancers to act on Igf2 gene and they are free to act on H19 (which produces lncRNA - probably a reservoir for miRNAs). On paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, preventing CTCF from binding, and the methylation also spreads down to H19 promoter. All this methylation leads to silencing of H19 and let the downstream enhancers free to act on Igf2 gene, which is then transcribed.</p>
<p>Igf2 is an oncogene - its overexpression leads to overgrowth of the foetus and predisposition to cancer like Wilms' tumor (childhood nephroblastoma). This tumor can be caused by loss of imprinting in H19/Igf2 locus where the ICR on maternal allele becomes methylated as well and therefore, Igf2 is transcribed from both maternal and paternal alleles. This leads to high dose of Igf2 and tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that belongs to DNA-methyl-transferase inhibitors (DNMTi). These drugs are nucleosides analogues that bind DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) after they are incorporated into DNA, and prevent them from action. This leads to global loss of methylation in dividing cells (because the binding of DNMTs is replication-dependent). In cancer, the demethylation particularly influences CpG islands. Many of the CpG islands, that are hypermethylated in cancer, are placed in promoters of tumor suppressor genes whose transcription can then lead to growth arrest and apoptosis of the cells. This effect was recently shown in MDS for another DNMTi, azacitidine, relieving repression of PU.1 gene which then leads to differentiation and apoptosis of the malignant cells (Curik et al., 2012).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation, similar to other epigenetic marks, is mitotically heritable which means that DNA methylation pattern is passed from mother to daughter cell. However, there are two periods when epigenetic marks undergo extensive reprogramming: pre-implantation period in embryonic development and primordial germ cells development. These are called "sensitive periods". (The reprogramming can happen to some extent also during somatic cell differentiation, but these are less pronounced.)</p>
<p>Cancer cells have aberrant methylation pattern which is passed on further generations of the malignant cells. But treatment with certain drugs can change this pattern, and the changed pattern is then passed.  The methylation change itself can lead to death of cancer cells, but it can also make them susceptible to further treatment with different chemotherapy. And because the change is heritable, the susceptibility can last even after the period of treatment with the "epigenetic" drug.</p>
<p>Special caution should be taken while treating younger patients. In these patients, epigenetic reprogramming in germ cells is still in progress and the treatment could influence this process (like imprinting etc.). </p></div>
