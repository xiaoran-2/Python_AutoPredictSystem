    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancerous cells the methylation of the genome is severely altered, especially so at CpG islands. Most of them are associated with promoters of key genes, some of which are critical to the cell cycle, growth, and DNA repair. Normally, these islands are protected from methylation so as to not silence the genes that they are associated with. In cancer, the islands are hypermethylated, thus silencing the normally expressed genes (“Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression”). Some of these genes contribute to tumor suppression, and therefore, this effective “erasing” of the tumor suppressor gene product will increase the cell’s chance of becoming cancerous.</p>
<p>Along with this hypermethylation, the other change in cancer cells is that sites that are normally methylated, have been demethylated. Intergenic regions and repeats are some of the regions that are usually methylated to prevent antisense transcription, and suppress transcription from alternative sites (Hassler &amp; Egger, 2012). If repeats are not silenced, this increases the rate of recombination rate during meiosis I of cell division (Dion et. al., 2008), and may place genes vital to development and growth next to promoters that induce a different level of expression than usual (Wang et. al., 2009).  This allows for the aberrant expression of repeats and enhanced or decreased expression of many genes. Also, transposons, whose CpG dinucleotides have been methylated, have a chance of being unmethylated in cancer cells, thus increasing the chance of translocations, insertions, and causing overall genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting or parent of origin specific expression is key to the proper development of many organisms. In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster of genes, the paternal and maternal alleles are differentially methylated. On the maternal allele, H19, which is a <em>cis</em> acting non-coding RNA, silences expression of Igf2 on the same allele. The CTCF binding domain, located upstream of the H19 gene, is also not methylated. The CTCF protein attaches to this region and allows for the preferential transcription of H19 instead of Igf2 (“Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression”). The paternal allele’s H19 gene and CTCF binding domain are methylated so the non-coding RNA is not transcribed and the binding of CTCF is blocked. <em>Igf2</em> is then transcribed instead of H19. Loss of this normal expression of the maternal allele is observed in Wilms’ tumor, thus resulting in the effective duplication of the epigenetic status of the paternal allele. There is no longer mono allelic expression, and instead a double dose of the <em>Igf2 </em>is present in the cell. If the paternal allele loses its normal methylation state, then <em>Igf2 </em>expression is down-regulated, which may result in symptoms such as restriction of growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of few DNA-demethylating agents that have been approved for use to treat “myelodysplastic syndromes.” (Cancer’s Epicentre). As the name of the class of drugs implies, it is able to remove methyl groups from cytosine bases in the genome, thus reversing the expression state of the genes associated with the methyl groups. In cancerous cells, genes whose promoters are normally unmethylated, can become methylated due to errors in epigenetic mechanisms. If Decitabine were to reach the cancerous cells in an organism, it would be able to demethylate CpG dinucleotides of tumor suppressor genes. This function could potentially reactivate the genes, tumor-suppresor, that should be able to slow down the growth of the cancer. It would also decrease the chance of any errors in methylation from occurring and preventing genes critical to genome stability from being suppressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering the DNA methylation of a cell does not only affect it at that moment, but has a lasting impact. After changing the methylation state, DNMT1 is one of the methyl transferases responsible for the maintenance of that mark in the DNA of daughter cells after cell division . It is in this way that altering the methylation of the genome can be maintained even in future generations of cells. However, as long as these effects last, one should not try to administer these drugs, for example to women who are pregnant, during sensitive periods, such as during the formation of the zygote or the development of the primordial germ cells in the growing fetus (“Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression”). At these time periods, the genome is being readily cleared of epigenetic marks and reprogrammed. Trying to alter the epigenome during these critical points would be detrimental to the laying down of proper epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation. Doing so would result in abnormal expression of genes and most likely even death of the developing fetus.</p></div>
