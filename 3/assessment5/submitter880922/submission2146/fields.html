    <div class="field-value"><p>Dna methylation at C5 position of the cytisone residue is quite a common genetic modification along the Dna sequence, it is found in approximately 70 80% of CpG dinucleotides in somatic cells.</p>
<p>CpG islands present in more than 60% of the mammalian promoters, wich are region rich of CpG dinucleotides, are altough usually demethylated to keep the promoter free of methylation silencing; only a very small portion of CpG islands are methylated in some tissue, in particoular in some case of poor promoters.</p>
<p>The first epigenetic abnorality seen in cancer cells is probably the increasing number of CpG islands methylation during the cancer developement from normal tissue to a metastatic one, CpGI ipermathylation is a biomarker sign of many tipes of cancers, a wide set of cancers are called CIMP CpGI methylator pheotype.</p>
<p>The increasing methylation of CpGI during cancer development contribute to one half of cancer causes, does not activate oncogenes, but increasignly suppress during cancer developement the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and moreover being mitotically heritable once acquired is mantained by the cancer cells.</p>
<p>Dna methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells is a constitutive mechanism to "protect" the Dna against recombination due to repetitive elements, transposive elements translocation or insertions and also repress trasnscriptional noise from aternative start sites in strong promoters. In general is necessary to mantain genome stability.</p>
<p>In cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements are subject to a parallel genome wide hypomethylation wich progress with cancer development wich disrupts all the mechanisms of the genomic stability that normally inergenic regions methylation provides; this may lead to a wide spread genomic instability , illegitiate recombination between repeats, activation of SINE and LINE transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and so also activation of oncogenes. Also hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters may lead to oncogene activation in some cancer types. as hypermethylation also hypomethylation is mitotically passed to all subseqent cancer cells once acquired in some locus.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>the H19/Igf2 cluster is one of many cluster of genes subject to imprint control regions, necessary to identify the paternal or maternal identity of a chromosome during germ cell developement. </p>
<p>In this particoular cluster the paternal allele is methylated in the imprint control region wich is situated between the Igf2  gene and the H19 gene and the downstream enhancers; methylation in the ICR prevent the binding on the ICR of the CTCF insulator protein so that the downstream enhancers can freely act on the Igf2 gene activating it, while the methylation spread to the H19 promoter silencing its transcription and action.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated so that CTCF can bind preventing the enhancers action on the Igf2 wich is silenced, while H19 is not subject to methylation spread and it is so expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor the imprinting of Igf2/H19 cluster is disrupted by the hypermethylation of the ICR also in the maternal allele,the hypermetilation also on the maternal allele of the ICR activate the transcription of the Igf2 gene on the maternal allele too so that the cell subject to this alteration has and produce a dobule quantity of the insulin like growth factor 2 wich promote cell growing in particoular during gestation and early developement promoting an aberrant cell growth</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an inhibitor of the Dna methyltransferase: it acts on  the enzyme DNMT, wich normally methylate Dna, blocking its action. It is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are icorporated into the DNA it is so replecation dependent, by blockign DNMT Decitabine drastically reduce the Dna methylation activity in the cells preventing the methylation along the DNA.</p>
<p>At high doses DNMT inhibitors like Decitabine are toxic and highly nonspecicific casusing high damage due to the total bloking of DNA methylation and lack of specifity; Drugs like Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect acting at quite low doses because at such doses they can prevent the high amount of methylation in the cells that due to some epigenetic affliction are subject to dna hypermethylation like cancer cells.</p>
<p>Drugs like Decitabine wich hits DNMTs have been demonstrated to be most effective on myelodisplastyc syndromes maybe because those are more dependet on tumor suppressor genes hypermethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering Dna methylation can have enduring effetcts on the epigenome for the same causes that make methylation pattern alterations like hyper and hypomethylation stable: methylation pattern is mitotically inherited due to the action of DNMT1 during dna replication.   So also the drug alterations of the methylation pattern, like methylation erasure or acquisition, are, once acquired, mantained in the cell line.</p>
<p>During our developement we have different senstive periods in wich we are more sensible and receptive to external and ambiental factors and their effect on our "epigenomic signature", in particoular on dna methylation.</p>
<p>The most sensitive ones are during primordial germ cell developement during gestation in wich  ICR, and the general paternal-maternal genome methylation are resetted to allow the creations of the particoular cells wich are the gametes, and after implantation in wich the genome methylation is resetted but not the ICR, is also important that during those periods some methylation is not resetted like the ICR after implantation or the IAPS in both. Also early development and neonatal life seems to be sensitive periods in some degree</p>
<p>So targeting with drugs the methylation pattern during those period is inadvisable because would highly interfere with the correct function of the epigenetic machinery during those periods preventing the correct reset or erasing ICR and IAPs when they dont have to.</p></div>
