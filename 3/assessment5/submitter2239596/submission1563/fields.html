    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation is a highly regulated normal physiological epigenetic process.</p>
<p>CpG islands are genomic regions that contain a high frequency of CpG sites. CpG islands typically occur at or near transcription start sites of housekeeping genes. They are also found in gene promoter regions where they can be potentially silenced by DNA methylation. In healthy cells, CpG islands are generally hypomethylated. This allows for an open chromatin structure which is necessary for regulating gene expression, transcription and replication.</p>
<p>Increases in CpG methylation causes transcriptional silencing of tumour suppressor genes, such as BRCA1, hMLH1, MGMT, which then become unresponsive to normal stimuli, which has a significant effect on gene expression patterns and cellular growth in that it can lead to selective advantage with regards to the growth and viability of cells.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. The normal function of DNA methylation at <em>intergenic regions</em> is to maintain genomic integrity and stability. If genomic integrity and stability is compromised, deletions, reciprocal translocations or insertions can occur. A second function pertains to silencing the expression at cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation at <em>repetitive elements</em> is to maintain genomic integrity, by either silencing repeats to prevent transposition, or by preventing transposition, or by silencing repeats to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, or by methylation of repeats to prevent illegitimate recombination. It has been suggested that DNA methylation changes in repetitive elements are associated with gene transcription, embryonic development and cell differentiation.</p>
<p>All cancers have aberrant methylation patterns. Two hallmarks of malignancies are i) hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements and, ii) hypermethylation at CpG islands which leads to genomic instability, such as deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions. Further abnormalities seen in cancer pertain to histone modifications, noncoding RNAs and the nuclear architecture.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is a process by which genes can show monoallelic expression based on the parent-of-origin of the allele. The parent of origin specific expression of the Igf2 and H19 genes are controlled by the imprinting centre 1. Normally, H19 is expressed only from the maternal allele, whereas Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>At the H19/Igf2 domain, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is paternally hypermethylated in the H19 promoter region and its expression is inactive (silenced). It also shows a compact chromatin structure. Both prevent CTCF from binding the ICR, allowing the enhancers to activate Igf2 expression. In contrast, on the unmethylated maternal allele, CTCF binding prevents enhancers from interacting with the Igf2 promoter, leading to the activation of H19 expression.</p>
<p>In some cancers, both the paternal and maternal copies of the Igf2 genes are active, which leads to a disruption of imprinting. This can result in a number of abnormalities, such as Wilms tumor, an embryonic neoplasm. Here, an X-linked tumour suppressor, WTX, is inactivated, leading to disrupted Igf2 imprinting. It results in biallelic expression and an upregulation of the gene. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, an overgrowth disorder, and Silver-Russel syndrome, an undergrowth and asymmetry disorder, are two other abnormalities.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (<em>Dagogen</em>) is a cytidine analog and is used as a drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndroms and acute myeloid leukemia, characterized by abnormal patters of DNA methylation and dysregulated gene expression (Klco JM at all. 2013)<a title="" href="#_edn1">[i]</a>. Decitabine has an anti-neoplastic effect. As a DNA demethylating agent it targets the epigenetic regulators, DNA demethyltransferases (DNMTs), acting as a demethyltransferase inhibitor. It irreversibly bind DNMTs upon DNA replication. The epigenetic ‘corrections’ are passed on during cell division to subsequent generations of cells until they are eventually erased.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In mammalian cells, DNA methylation is an essential component of the epigenetic machinery, regulating gene expression and providing an orderly mechanism whereby expression patters are maintained through mitosis. Recently, demethyltransferase inhibitors have been employed to alter DNA methylation patters that have become aberrant as seen in cancer. Here, evidence has been mounting that when given at the right low dose and in combination with other drugs, that they can re-activate tumour suppressor genes that have been silenced by DNA methylation and thus halting or at least slowing down further tumour progression.</p>
<p>Such approach is not advisable during sensitive periods of an organisms. Sensitive periods are periods during which altered environments may have an effect on epigenetic control. In mammals, two such periods stand out: firstly, the period from primordial germ cell development to the production of mature gametes and, secondly, the pre-implantation and early post-implantation period, during which active remodeling of the epigenome, such as removal and laying down of different epigenetic marks at different places of the genome  takes place. If DNMT inhibitors, which are division dependent, are given during sensitive periods of development, they can disrupt the epigenetic machinery and severely affect all normally dividing cells.</p></div>
