    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in cancer cell has a very different profile than that of normal cells.</p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG islands are normally protected from methylation meaning they tend to be hypomethylated.</p>
<p>In cancer cells on the other hand there is hypermethylation of the CpG islands, this condition was found in all cancer cells that had been researched and is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Hypermethylation of the CpG islands in cancer happens in tumor suppressor genes and causes silencing of those tumor suppressor genes. Since DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark and it is mitotically heritable the epimutanted cells are rapidly selected (e.g. because they divide faster, and don't die as much as regular cells do). This allows the tumor cells to spread and the disease advance. The hypermethylation increases with the time spent of the disease.</p>
<p>To maintain genomic stability in normal cell repetitive elements (repeats) are heavily methylated and hetrochromotized as are intergentic regions.</p>
<p>In contrast, a genome wide hypomethylation occurs in all tumor cells. Hypomethylation in tumor cells most commonly happens in repeats and can leads to genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes. The illegitimate recombination between repeats (and intergenic regions) that are activated without methylation, can cause deletions, insertions or duplications and reciprocal translocations in the DNA sequence itself. A high expression of neighboring genes and intergene disruptions can occur as the repeats become activated and transpose around the genome. Similarly to the process of hypermethylation of CpG Islands the hypomethylation genome wide increases with time in the disease.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since many of the imprinted genes are contact to growth promotion or restriction, the loss of imprint in ICR can lead to development of tumors.</p>
<p>In H19/Igf2 cluster, hypermethylation of the ICR in is the cause of wilm's tumor development.</p>
<p>In normal cells the ICR of H19/Igf2 is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. The methylated ICR on the parental allele blocks the insulator CTCF from binding. without insulation the enhancers, located downstream act on the Igf2 and it's expressed.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated, CTCF binds to it and insulates the enhancers from Igf2, which is not expressed. Instead the enhancers act on H19 which is expressed.</p>
<p>hans in the normal cell, the parental allele expresses the growth promoting Igf2 while the maternal allele expresses the growth restricting H19.</p>
<p>hypermethylation in the ICR of maternal allele leads to Wilm's tumor . The methylated ICR on the maternal allele is unable to bind CTCF and behaves like the paternal allele. As a result there is expression of Igf2 is doubled while H19 is silenced. This new pattern of over growth leads to wilm's tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methylation inhibitor (DNMTi). It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p>The drug irreversibly binds DNMTs to the nucleoside and when the cell divides they can no longer be released. This means that drug works once the cell to divides and since cancer cells divide very rapidly this is effective in demethylating the tumor cells. It is currently in use in myelogenouses leukaemia. Since hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumor suppresser genes is so common in cancer, the demethylation that this type of drugs offer can potentially affect many other tumor types by allowing the cells to express tumor suppressing genes. The use of this class of drugs on other tumor is currently in research.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations to DNA methylation are mitotically heritable. DMNT1 an enzyme that lays DNA methylation, is responsible for the methylation of daughter strands of DNA, by recognizing the hemi-methylated DNA and copying the methylation patterns to the daughter strands. thus changes to DNA methylation patterns will continue to replicat beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>The strongest contraindication would be during the sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming, when epigenetic marks are erased and then reestablished.</p>
<p>epigenetic reprogramming happens in the embryo. First during early development, before the placental implementation; the methylation profile that is established after this reprogramming will generally maintain stable in the somatic cells throughout one's life.</p>
<p> The second period is during primordial germ cells development, which starts at mid gestation.pregnant woman should never be treated with drugs that can affect the epigenetic programming of their embryos. Since the germ cells stay in not fully developed through childhood, (possibly up to the age of 12 in man and 10 in women, as shown by the Overkalix research.) the effect that an epigenetic treatment will on their germ cells, can potentially lead to disease in their children and grandchildren and is therefore also not advisable.</p>
