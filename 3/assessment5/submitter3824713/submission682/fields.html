    <div class="field-value"><p>In most of the mammalian genomes, CpG islands are often unmethylated, poorly methylated (H3K4) and acetylated. That is because CpG islands contain the gene promoter regions, and in order to accomplish its function, they need to have activation marks (H3K4me and acetylation). So that, an unmethylated CpG island is related to gene expression.</p>
<p>On the other hand, looking at CpG islands in cancer patients, we figure out an hypermethylation of them. Hence, CpG islands in cancer patients have certain repressive epigenetic marks like H3K9me and H3K27me and a lack of H3K4me and acetylation. Thus, that promoter regions in CpG islands are often repressed leading to a gene silencing.</p>
<p>Regarding to relation between disruption of DNAme and disease, we must consider that both oncogenes and tumor repressor genes are GENES and are under a promoter control. Whether we have a silencing of tumor repressor genes we will obatain a high possibility to develope a cancer. just for instance, hypermethylation at RB, MCH1 and BRCA1 promoter regions, leads to a cancer development (retinoblastoma, colorreclal and breats cancer correspondingly.</p>
<p>In contrast to CpG islands, intragenic regions and repetitive elements in heatlhy subjects are broadly methylated, and hence, silenced.</p>
<p>But in cancer patients, we observe a broad unmethylation fo that regions, obtaining a high genomic instability reflected in illegitimate recombinations, transposition and activation of cryptic promoters.</p>
<p>a broadly unmethylation of intragenic regions and repetitive elements, seen in DNMT1 KO mice, are lethal at embrionic development, so its relation to disease is obvious. Further studies, took adult mice and made them a specific depletion of DNMT1 in certain tissues (Thymus). This experiment showed that mice ends up getting cancer. Further, mice DNMT3b KO develope ICF syndrome, characterized by high rate of genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation pattern of the <strong>maternal</strong> allele in a healthy subject starts in a <strong>unmethylated ICR</strong> (Imprint Control Region). When it is unmethylated, binds CTCF, which isolate the maternal Igf2 (oncogene located downtstream of the ICR) from the enhancers by a DNA looping, hence, silencing the Igf2 expression. Therefore, enhancers act on H19 (located uptstream of the ICR).</p>
<p>The methylation pattern of the <strong>paternal</strong> allele in a healthy subject starts in a <strong>methylated ICR</strong>. Because of its methylation, the binding of CTCF is not allowed and therefore the enhancers can act directly on the Igf2 gene activating its expression.</p>
<p>In summary, in a heathy subject we have expression of Igf2 from only the paternal allele.</p>
<p>But when we consider cancer patients, we observe that both ICRs (maternal and paternal) are methylated. This fact causes that both alleles behave as the healthy paternal allele, resulting on double expression of Igf2 and and causing the associated disease.</p>
<p>Patients with this disrupting (double dose of Igf2) suffer a phenotype of fetal and postnatal overgrowth (large tongue), increasing the predisposition to pediatric tumors</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent, <span>used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span></span></span></p>
<p>This drug is a cytidine analog that covalently trap the DNA methyltransferase I (DNMT1) protein onto DNA, targeting the enzyme for proteasome degradation. The resulting depletion of DNMT1 leads to passive demethylation in dividing cells.</p>
<p>The observed effects of low dose decitabine on cell growth, differentiation and enhanced immunological responses to tumor-associated antigens are thought to be due to the reexpression of critical genes silenced by aberrant promoter hypermethylation. Sustained gene re-expression has been associated with clinical response, supporting the view that it is critical to the therapeutic mechanism of action of these drugs. Clinically relevant low doses of decitabine and azacitidine can lead to sustained changes in gene expression that are associated with reduced tumorigenicity in mice bearing transplanted tumor xenografts.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some cases, an aditional epigenetic modification onto an epigenetically controled gene may lead to variation in expression profile. An active gene may become inactive, a silent gene may be consolidated as silent and another silent gene may be exchange particular repressive marks. This aditional epigenetic modifications may consolidate an epigenetic state creating disruptions later in the development.</p>
<p>A sensitive period<span> represent heightened epochs of brain plasticity, where the early environment is able to shape neural circuits and thus determine structural and functional aspects of brain and behavior for the lifespan. It is through this so-called programming effect on the CNS that early-life experiences are thought to confer either risk or resilience regarding later psychopathology.</span></p>
<p><span>At least in mice, are reported 2 sensitive periods of development. The first occurs in the first 10 days of life, which is the blastocyst state, and the second occurs during the gamotogenesis, at sperm and egg development.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the whole genome is quite sensitive to external and environmental influences and our treatment, which is foused on a single target, could affect more targets, causing more damage than prevented.</span></span></p></div>
