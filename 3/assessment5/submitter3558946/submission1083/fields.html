    <div class="field-value"><p>     DNA methylation is the basis for imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin and can occur in CGIs of promoter regions, at intergenic intervals and at repetitive elements. Global changes in DNA methylation is a hallmark of cancer and have been found in every cancer ever been studied.</p>
<ul><li>      In a normal cell CGIs tend to be protected from methylation and when they are methylated that leads to silencing of gene expression by either a formation of repressive chromatin structure or by prohibiting transcription factor binding.</li>
</ul><ul><li>     However, in cancer cells promoter CGIs tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. DNA methylation is an alternative, often more frequent, to genetic mutation, to silence tumor suppressor genes. Some examples are RB, MLH1, BRCA1 and MGMT.</li>
</ul><ul><li>     Although in a normal cell CGIs tend to be unmethylated, intergenic intervals  and  repetitive elements tend to be methylated.  DNA methylation is actually mutagenic but there is a benefit to it (genome defense model). At intergenic intervals maintains genomic integrity, silences a cryptic promoter, or a cryptic splice site. Also at repetitive elements prevents transposition, avoids transcriptional interference from strong promoters and may prevent illegitimate recombination.</li>
</ul><ul><li>    In cancer cells intergenic intervals and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated. This genome-wide hypomethylation occurs to some degree in all tumour types tested and progresses with tumorigenicity like CGI hypermethylation. It leads to genomic instability by illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Also hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters, less common than hypomethylation of repeats, can result in oncogene activation.</li>
</ul><p>   In conclusion the role of DNA methylation is context dependent. Depletion of DNA methylation  at CGIs of tumor suppressor genes suppresses tumorigenesis but at intergenic intervals and repetitive elements enhances tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>      H19 produces Cdkn1c which is a tumour suppressor and <em>Igf2 </em>promotes growth which is an oncogene. The Igf2 and H19 genes and their reciprocal imprinting is governed by sharing enhancers and an imprint control region ICR where binds CTCF.</p>
<p>     On the maternal allele  CTCF binds within the unmethylated ICR, generating an insulator that prevents <em>Igf2</em> from accessing the shared enhancers that are located on the <em>H19</em> side of the insulator. Thus, the insulator effectively acts as an enhancer-blocker and that results in a <strong>maternally-expressed <em>H19</em> gene</strong> and silencing of <em>Igf2.</em></p>
<p>     On the paternal chromosome, methylation at the ICR not only prevents CTCF from binding, allowing <em>Igf2</em> to engage the enhancers, resulting in a <strong>paternally-expressed <em>Igf2</em> gene</strong> but it is also required for methylation at the <em>H19</em> promoter and silencing of <em>H19.</em></p>
<p>    In Wilm’s tumour with loss of imprinting  the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype and both alleles are behaving like the paternal allele, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth . The loss of imprinting can be because of mutations or translocations but rarely can be caused by disruption of DNA methylation imprints.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>         Decitabine,  an epigenetic drug that inhibits DNA methylation, is a member of a growing list of epigenetic drugs that can alter gene expression and other aspects of cell function without affecting the DNA. Decitabine irreversibly binds DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, therefore replication dependent.</p>
<p>        Originally developed as nucleoside analog, the drug clearly causes DNA damage at high doses. However the success in MDS and AML reflected other mechanisms that exert their effects only at low doses.</p>
<p>        Decitabine can reactivate tumor suppressor genes silenced by aberrant DNA methylation. Because this epigenetic change is reversible, it is a good target for therapy.  </p>
<p>        Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>During DNA replication DNA is hemi-methylated and DNA methyltransferases  (like DNMT1) are responsible for methylating the new strands of DNA thus maintaining the DNA methylation pattern.If DNMT is blocked by a drug even for one round of DNA replication the new DNA would remain hemi-methylated and during a second round of DNA replication the unmethylated strands will replicate new unmethylated strands.  Even if a DNMT inhibitor is not used anymore this DNA will remain unmethylated. That is why a DNMT inhibitor will have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.</li>
</ul><ul><li>A sensitive period is when demethylation of paternal and maternal genome is occurring and new methylation  patterns are set.</li>
<li>There are two waves of reprogramming: one is in primordial germ cell development and the second one in early development.</li>
</ul><ul><li>In both times epigenetic  marks need to be cleared between generations to restore totipotency.  Also during early development new epigenetic tags are set that will determine its cell fate (cellular differentiation) and will act as a cellular memory. Those marks are laid down in each somatic cell for the rest of its life. That is why it would be inadvisable to treat patients with a drug that affects epigenetic marks during that time.</li>
