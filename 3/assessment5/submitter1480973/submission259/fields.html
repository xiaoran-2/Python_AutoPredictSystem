    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. Normally these CpG sites are unmethylated which allows the tumour suppressor genes to be activated and thus prevent unrestrained growth.  </p>
<p>In cancer, DNA methylation is increased in the promoter and the shores. This inactivates the tumour suppressor which in turn allows proliferation of cancer cells.</p>
<p>Aberration of epigenetic control in this way contributes to disease by generally evading growth suppressors, deregulating cell energetics, resisting cell death and activating metastases. This situation is found locally in cancerous sites in the body whereas genome-wide, there is hypomethylation causing genomic instability.</p>
<p>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the gene are methylated in a normal cell which serves to protect the genome from transposable elements such as translocations, insertions and illegitimate recombinations. They will guard against deletions and transcriptional interference as well.</p>
<p>In contrast, the state is reversed in cancer, where we see these areas more likely to be hypomethylated.  This absence of methylation would result in loss of genomic integrity and loss of protection against the transposable elements which are likely to increase and disrupt the workings of the cell.</p>
<p>As intergenic regions and repetitive elements are part of what has been called "junk" DNA and constitutes a sizeable portion of the human genome,  a disruption of DNA methylation here would have a profound effect.  This then presents in cancer as genome-wide hypomethylation as mentioned earlier and a great loss of genomic stability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a nucleoside analogue, is an FDA approved drug for Myelodysplastic Syndrome progressed to Acute Myeloid Leukemia, that belongs to the DNMTI or DNA methyl transferase inhibitor class of epigenetic inhibitors. During DNA replication, it irreversibly binds into DNA methyltransferases after they are incorporated into DNA.</p>
<p>When the DNMT proceeds along the DNA strand during replication, copying to the daughter strand, the DNMTI drug will not release the DNMT, thereby inhibiting the methylation of the tumour suppressor genes. This allows the tumour suppressor genes to be expressed which results in suppression of tumour cells.</p>
<p>At low doses, Decitabine has a remarkable effect against DNA methylation in tumour cells; because they are rapidly growing and dividing, they are susceptible to an epigenetic inhibitor that targets the very place in the genes where the disease of cancer is being passed on from cell to cell. As the dose increases, the toxic effects of the drug increase, while the DNA methylation effect decreases.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration of DNA methylation by epigenetic drugs can have a lasting effect on the genome because they can potentially demethylate all the cells in the body with unknown consequences.  However at the low doses used, they target the rapidly growing cells of cancer. The effect is passed on to the new cells because they have incorporated the new epigenetic instructions. This could be why these new cells subsequently become more susceptible to the standard cancer drug therapies.  </p>
<p>A sensitive period is one where epigenetic markers are being erased and being laid down anew.  DNA is being demethylated naturally during a sensitive period and then over a few days becomes methylated again. Use of a drug such as Decitabine will interfere.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are during the blastocyst stage in fetal development and also during primordial germ cell development in the embryo which is going to affect the next generation.   </p>
<p>Treating a pregnant women when the embryo is forming the primordial germ cells is inadvisable, as it will have effects on the subsequent generation ie. the woman's grandchild.  Treating a pregnant woman when the embryo is in the blastocyst stage will affect the developing child in her womb..</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer.   For example, the loss of imprinting  at the Imprint Control Regions or ICRs of the H19Igf2 cluster can contribute to a childhood kidney cancer known as Wilm's Tumour.</p>
<p>In the normal state the paternal allele is methylated.  The enhancer acts on Igf2 because CTCF does not bind to insulate so Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Again, in the normal state, the maternal allele is unmethylated. The CTCF binds the insulator element and the enhancer acts on H19 but Igf2 will be silent so there is no expression of the gene on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In loss of imprinting, in many cancers, genes can become either overexpressed from alleles of both maternal and paternal origin, being activated, or conversely there can be silencing where neither the maternal or paternal allele is expressed.  In Wilm's Tumour, there is hypermethylation on the ICR of both maternal and paternal alleles.  This allows expression of Igf2 by the maternal as well as by the paternal allele, instead of just the paternal allele.  Since Igf2 is growth promoting and there is a twofold increase of it, the disease can progress.</p></div>
