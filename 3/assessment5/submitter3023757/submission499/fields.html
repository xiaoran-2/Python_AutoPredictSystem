    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Epigenetically, cancer can be seen as the freeing of genomic prisoners from their methyl cells.  When gene expression needs turning off methylation of GpG islands is a reliable switch.  Methylation is the attaching of a methyl group, a carbon atom attached to three hydrogens, to the starting line (promoter) of a gene.  The methyl group attracts blocking enzymes to form a physical barrier.  When the gene-copying enzyme RNA polymerase arrives to copy and help reproduce the gene the methyl mob says, “No way RNA!” They prevent physical access to the gene. It can’t be copied which means “No protein from you gene!”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Some genes suppress tumor growth. Like responsible parents they decide when to tell fast-growing cells “enough”. In some forms of cancer CpGIs upstream of  tumor-supressing genes are methylated and growth suppression stops.  Cells can then go rogue and start reproducing like randy presidential candidates.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Our genomes are a mess.  Genes point in wrong directions, combine “illegitimately”, code for nonsense, etc. Methylation in intergenic regions is like negative commandments in Judaism.  It works to shut down unacceptable behavior.  Methylation in intergenetic regions tries to keep crazy, counterproductive commands and codes at bay, maintain genomic integrity, and allow useful commands free expression. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Transposons and other repeated sequences are rude little stretches of DNA  with no sense of decorum. They can leap, willi-nilli into and mutate very useful genes, like ones that maintain cell structure or code for enzyme production.. Methylation is like valium for repeats.  Methylated repeats are sleeping DNA dogs they lie quietly.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Cancer tumors usually include genome-wide hypomethylation.  Without methylation cops locking up bad genetic actors the mad transposons and crazed intergenic codes run wild in the genome, mutating good genes into bad and raising general oncological hell. Think Mad Metastasizing Max.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Imprinting, like X inactivation insures we get just enough of a good thing.  On the paternal allele of human chromosome 11  "enhancers" upstream of Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 igf2 "want" to energize its expression. However between them and the gene lie the ICR and H19 gene.  On the paternal allele the IRC is normally methylated.  The methylation spreads to H19 preventing enhancers from reaching either and clearing their path to igf2 and expression of the growth factor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">On the maternal allele, the  protein CTCF blocks enhancers from the IRC but not by methylation. CTCF  “covers” the ICR preventing enhancer action.  The enhancers energize their “second choice gene”, the “tumor suppressor” H19.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px;">In Wilm’s tumor CTCF protection of the maternal ICR is lost. (</span><a style="font-size:14px;" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Vu%20TH%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=12702581">Vu TH</a><span style="font-size:14px;">, </span><a style="font-size:14px;" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Chuyen%20NV%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=12702581">Chuyen NV</a><span style="font-size:14px;">, et al 2003)</span><span style="font-size:14px;">  as is expression of H19.  The maternal allele behaves like the paternal.  Igf2 is overexpressed leading to the disease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Fundamentally the disruption of imprinting in the igf2/H19 cluster contributes to disease by misregulating expression of growth/no-growth genes.  H19 want to slow growth down, igf2 wants the opposite.  When they are in balance growth is “normal” but over or under expression of either can lead to disease.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an "irreversible DNA methyltransferase inhibitor."  It's a demethylation sledgehammer.  Many cancers exhibit wide-scale hypemethylation.  With hypermethylation expression accross the genome is reduced, including of genes coding for tumor growth suppression. This obviously allows greater tumor growth and appears a factor in cancer.  </p>
<p>Decitabine's anti-tumor effect is because it demethylates, loosens up the entire genome freeing among other things,  tumor-supressing mechanisms.  Tumor-supressing genes express code for tumor-mugging proteins.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">In 2006 Decitabine was approved by the FDA for treatment of Mylodysplastic Syndrome MDS, a disease of the marrow http://goo.gl/DOUXEU. In 2012 the EC approved decitabine under the name, </span><span style="font-size:14px;">DACOGEN for treatment of acute myeloid lukemia.  </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The article explains that "<span>Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased." </span></p>
<p><span>Epigenetically speaking a "sensitive period" is one wherein the genome or parts of it are highly reactive to their environment. What happens to the individual during a sensitive period can be retained in the epigenome.  The sensitive periods in the human development discussed in this wonderful class include when the egg becomes a blastocyst and immediately prior to its implantation in the uterus.</span></p>
<p><span>Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because the long-term effects on the individual or his/her offspring can not be predicted. The environment can significantly impact the developing fetus. For example, children of women who were in the third trimester of their pregnancies (an apperantly sensitibe period) during the "Dutch Hunger Winter had increased risks of diabetes years later. (LH Lumey et al 2007).  Treating patients during "sensitive"periods could harm them and/or their offspring in permanently. </span></p></div>
