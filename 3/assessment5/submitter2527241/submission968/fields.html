    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in CpG islands is mediated by de novo methyltransferases, DNMT3a and DNMT3b.  CpG islands are located in gene promoter regions.  Methylated cytosines cause silencing of gene expression.  The primary mechanism is a repressive chromatin structure formed at methylated CpG involving MeCP1 and MeCP2 CpG binding proteins.  These proteins recruit other chromatin condensing factors.  The chromatin is inaccessible for transcription.  Methylation may block transcription factor binding to silence a gene.</p>
<p> In cancer, CpG loci of tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated disabling  tumor suppression.  Different tumor types display unique loci of CpG methylation making the pattern useful as a cancer biomarker.  Methylation of CpG island shores may be a better predictor of  of gene expression than CpG island methylation.  CpG methylation increases with time but it may be difficult to separate this from the result of increase with aging.  CpG islands may be methylated in groups of genes, CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype) gene sets.  The CIMP gene sets are used as biomarker signatures for tumor types, to identify a primary tumor source, and as predictors of disease treatment outcome.</p>
<p> Aberrant CpG methylation silences tumor suppressor genes.  Epimutations are mitotically heritable and rapidly selected resulting in uncontrolled cell growth due to silencing of tumor suppressors.</p>
<p> Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated.  Repetitive element silencing prevents transpositions, mutated repeats by cytosine conversion to thymine, avoidance of transcriptional interference by promoters, and prevention of illegitimate recombination.  In intergenic regions, DNA methylation silences harmful genetic elements.</p>
<p> Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to cancer by failure to silence these regions leading to oncogene activation, illegitimate recombinaton among repeats, transposition, activation of cryptic promoters leading to disruption of neighboring genes, and  insertions and deletions.  Genomic instability is a factor in neurodegenerative diseases, ALS and myotonic distrophy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Paternal allele methylation at the ICR, imprinting control region,  blocks CTCF binding. Absence of CTCF results in methylation spread to the H19 promoter to silence H19.  Enhancers downstream of H19 act upon Igf2 since they are not blocked by CTCF and its cofactors.  After fertilization, the secondarily imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) located near Igf2 are methylated.</p>
<p>The maternal allele ICR is unmethylated.   CTCF and cofactors bind.  Enhancer blocking  by altered chromatin structure occurs allowing the enhancers to reach the H19 promoter instead of Igf2.  H19 is activated and Igf2 is silent.  The nearby DMRs remain unmethylated.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumor has loss of imprinting at the maternal ICR resulting in expression of both the paternal and maternal allele Igf2 as a result of ICR methylation, silencing of H19 via methylation of its promoter, and enhancer mediated expression of Igf2.  The maternal ICR is methylated resulting in the same expression pattern present in the paternal allele .  Igf2, insulin growth factor 2, functions to increase cell growth thus overexpression results in  tumor growth. </p>
<p>Hypomethylation and activation of maternal Igf2 in early development causes Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  A primary feature is overgrowth and increased cancer risk. The rate is increased in ART babies.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that irreversibly binds  DNA methyltransferases. </p>
<p>Cells incorporate decitabine into replicating DNA and transcriptionally active RNA because it is an analog of cytidine.  This incorporation binds the  methyltransferase  resulting in  demethylation of the sequence. </p>
<p>Demethylation of hypermethylated  tumor supressor genes reactivates them causing the cell to cease abnormal growth.  While methylation patterns are passed from mother to daughter cells during cell division, it has been found that once methyl marks are removed, they do not return to the methylated state.  It appears that the tumor growth may stop without killing all of the cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can be heritable via the primordial germ cell (PGC) producing transgenerational effects.  Mitotic heritablity occurs in somatic cells which may cause life long alterations of gene expression. </p>
<p> A sensitive period is defined by periods of time when alterations in the environment may change the epigenetic status of the DNA.</p>
<p> In the zygote methylation marks are reset during pre-implantation  and  early development and during PGC development .  There is evidence that a sensitive period exists in a child's brain, immune system, and skeleton until approximately the 2nd birthday.</p>
<p>Patients are treated systemically with epigenetic drugs.  During sensitive periods, danger exists that methylation patterns will be altered in rapidly dividing tissues and in tissues where active reprogramming is occurring.  Treatment of a pregnant patient during early gestation threatens to perturb normal gene expression in the early developing fetus.  If treatment occurs during development of primordial germ cells, it is possible that epigenetic mutations may be generationally heritable.  Young children are at higher risk of developing epigenetic somatic cell mutations that are carried into adulthood resulting in disease phenotypes long after the mutation has occurred; therefore, this treatment option should not be used during these sensitive periods.</p></div>
