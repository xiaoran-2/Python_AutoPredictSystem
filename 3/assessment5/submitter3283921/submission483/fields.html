    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer involves activation of oncogenes as well as inactivation of tumour suppressor genes which can both happen genetically or epigenetically via alteration of DNA methylation at the CpG islands.</p>
<p>To understand how DNA methylation is altered in cancer, we should get to know what happens in the CpG islands of the normal functioning cells, in terms of DNA methylation. Generally, DNA methylation at the CpG islands silences the tumour suppressor genes. The more methylation of the CpG island, the more the tumour supressor genes are being silenced and vice versa.</p>
<p>In normal cells, the CpG islands are hypomethylated. Hypomethylation of the CpG islands allows the tumour suppressor genes to be expressed thereby preventing cancer from occuring.</p>
<p>In cancer cells however, the DNA methylation of the CpG islands are disrupted in the sense that the CpG islands progressively become hypermethylated. Hypermethylation of the CpG islands locks down the tumour suppressor genes, thereby contributing to the disease.</p>
<p>The repeats and intergenic regions of normal cells are heavily methylated and heterochromatinized. That is to say the DNA are so densely packaged to ensure genomic stability. Therefore, recombinations between repeats and intergenic regions rarely occur.</p>
<p>In cancer cellls however, the reverse is the case. There is hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions. Bec... of this hypomethylation, lossely packaged DNA or open chromatin.</p>
<p>This means that repeats can make copies of themselves and, so they jump around the genome or transpose in the genome where they disrupt the coding region of a gene or activate neighbouring genes and this can lead to transciptional aberrations as seen in the agouti gene or the axin gene. The overall outcome in cancer is that there will be deletions, insertions or even reciprocal translocations which leads to genomic instability responsible for cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal cell, the imprint control region (ICRs) are methylated in the paternal allele. Because of this methylation, the enhancers would bind on the Igf2 because CTCF is not binding to insulate the imprint control region (ICRs). This would result in Igf2 being expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele however, the imprint control regions are unmethylated. CTCF would bind to insulate the imprint control region (ICRs) which is unmethylated. Consequently, the enhancers would bind on the H19 resulting in the silencing of the Igf2 from the maternal allele. Which means Igf2 will not be expressed.</p>
<p>In Wim's tumour, the imprint control regions (ICRs) is methylated on the maternal allele contrary to what is observed in a normal cell. As a result of this methylation, Igf2 will end up being expressed from the maternal allele as well.</p>
<p>This means that in Wilm's tumour, there is double dose of Igf2 expression from both the maternal allele and the paternal allele in comparison with what happens in a normal cell where Igf2 is only expressed in the paternal allele. And because Igf2 is growth promoting, this double dose of Igf2 would contribute to Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors known as the DNA-demethylating agents.</p>
<p>Decitabine decreses DNA methylation by inhibiting enzymes that attach methyl groups to histone proteins. Decitabine therefore inhibits histone overmethylation.</p>
<p>Decitabine can have anti-tumour effect by inhibiting the overactivity of enzymes resposible for overmethylation of histones in the DNA of cancer cells. Histone overmethylation is known to silence the genes they surround, including so-called tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. By decreasing DNA methylation, Decitabine prevents the tumour-supressor genes and other anti-tumour genes from being silenced by histone overmethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has an enduring effect on the epigenome with the help of a DNA methyltransferase called DNMT1. DNMT1 maintains DNA methylation by copying DNA methylation to new daughter strands of DNA during cell division, thereby giving DNA methylation its enduring effects on the epigenome. An example of how DNA methylation can have enduring effect on the epigenome can be seen in the process of X-inactivation and genomic imprinting.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is a period of development when the epigentic marks that have been laid down in one life time in somatic cells are wiped out to ensure there is pluripotency in subsequent generations. Sensitive period basically is a period of generalized epigenetic reprogramming during development.</p>
<p>There are two major sensitive periods. These include the Pre-implantation early development period and the Primordial germ cell development. During these periods epigenetic marks and a set of imprinted gene are being reprogrammed.</p>
<p>During sensitive periods, young patients do have develolping cells that are very unstable as they are still undergoing epigenetic reprogramming. Treating young patients during these sensitive periods can inhibit the epigenetic machinery and this could be very lethal for the developing individual. </p></div>
