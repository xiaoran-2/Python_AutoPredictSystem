    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands, which are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, are usually hypomethylated in normal cells. This circumstance causes activation of the tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Abnormal hypermethylation of CpG islands cause the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. This epigenetic mutation is mitoticaly heritable, progresses with time and is usually more frequent than genetic mutations. This aberration may be found by genomic wide DNA methylation studies.</p>
<p>This hypermethylation of CpG islands, causing silencing of tumour suppressor genes, are significant factors for tumorigenesis, mainly if they are acting at the same time with other contributing factors such as activation of growth promoters, or going on in both two copies of the tumour suppressor gene (Knudson hypothesis).</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells. This fact promotes genomic stability and integrity.</p>
<p>In cancer, disruption of the epigenetic machinery (such as abnormal depletion of DNMTs) can cause hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, decreasing in this way genomic stability.</p>
<p>Under this circumstance, it is reduced the capability to avoid illegitimate deletions, reciprocal translocations, duplications and insertions. In addition, lack of silencing of repeats could not prevent transpositions, transcriptional interference from strong promoter and illegitimate recombination between repeats favored by a not closely packaged heterochromatin. All of these disruptions strongly contribute to the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele has methylated the imprint control region (ICR) of the Igf2/H19 cluster in a normal cell. Then, the protein insulator CTCF does not bind the paternal ICR, excluding insulator action between the enhancers (located downstream) and Igf2.  As a consequence, the enhancers are free to act over Igf2, which in this manner is being <span style="text-decoration:underline;">expressed</span> in the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Downstream methylation spreading from the ICR to H19 methylates this island promoter which is silenced.</p>
<p>The maternal allele has the ICR unmethylated in a normal cell. Then, the protein insulator CTCF binds the ICR, insulating the enhancers (located downstream) from Igf2, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">silencing</span> this oncogene in the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, an abnormal hypermethylation of the ICR of the Igf2/H19 cluster of the maternal allele causes the activation of the Igf2 gene. This disruption of the normal imprinting of the maternal allele causes the expression of the Igf2 (which is also expressed in the normal paternal allele).</p>
<p>The disease is caused by this twofold expression of Igf2 which doubles the normal dose of this growth promoter, inducing this childhood kidney malignancy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).</p>
<p>Being a nucleoside analogue, it binds to DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) when they are incorporated to DNA. This not reversible binding then reduces DNA methylation. As methylation of the daughter strands during mitosis is carried out by DNMT1, the action becomes depending on cell replication. As a consequence, the impact of Decitabine is more important on cells that are divided more rapidly than other somatic cells (cancer cells have a tendency to divide fast).</p>
<p>As an anti tumour drug Decitabine caused DNA demethylation, being lower doses adequate for treatment of tumours that are depending on hypermethylation of CpG islands promoters of tumour suppressor genes such as AML (acute myeloid leukemia) and its precursor MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs that alter DNA methylation can have long lasting effects beyond the period of treatment because alterations produced in the epigenome will be mitotically heritable and may remain in somatic cells for the whole life, as stable epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those time intervals of active remodeling of the epigenome, when it is easier to influence the epigenetic make-up.</p>
<p>They take place during embryonic development (from early pre-implantation to early post-implantation) and also for the period of primordial germ cell development until eggs and sperm get maturity.</p>
<p>That is why treatment with epigenetic drugs of young patients, who are still developing germ cells, would be carefully evaluated. It should also be taken into account periconceptional periods, and as well “slow growth periods” in young people (from nine to twelve years of age in boys and from eight to ten years of age in girls) when gametes are still maturing. Treatment that implies disrupting the epigenetic scenery of children and young people are not advisable without being carefully assessed, weighting up risks for downstream effects, and when patient survival is not the exclusive target.</p></div>
