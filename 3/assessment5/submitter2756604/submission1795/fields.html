    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Q1</p>
<p>In a normal cell, the CpG islands are hypomethylated, this region, normally the  hypomethylated of CpG islands are related with the expression of genes, because in this regions are in the promoter of genes, inducing expression or not of the genes.  In this case the importance in cancer is relevant with the silencing o inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, in form of methylated of CpG islands. The silencing of tumor suppressor genes, and others genetics disorders (for example: oncogenes expression) contributed to induce the cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In general the DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is methylated, but in cancer this regions are  hypomethylated. The functions of these regions are still unclear but it has been demonstrated genomic instability of this regions by hypomethylation, in form of illegitimate recombination between repeats, deletions, translocations, insertions or Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes ( for example A<sup>vy</sup> and Axin  alleles). This genomics instability could induce to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICRs H19/Igf2 is a example of how alterations in DNA methylation can result in loss of imprinting. In a normal cell the imprint control region it’s methylated on the pattern allele and it’s unmethylated on the maternal allele. When the ICR it’s unmethylated, the CTCF (is a transcription factor) can binding to ICRs, the enhancers will act on H19, promoted his transcription; the Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele in this case. In the pattern allele the enhancers can act on Igf2, because CTCF is not binding on ICRs, the Igf2 is expressed from the pattern allele. With loss of imprinting the ICRs , the Igf2 is expressed from the maternal allele and the pattern allele, the Igf2 is overexpressed, the Igf2 is growth promoting, associated with Wilm’s tumor, a disease kidney.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitabine is a drug that is a DNA methylation inhibitors or hypomethylating agent, this drug can induce the demethylation of DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. In general this drug can have an anti-tumour effect because some genes exist a relationship between hypermethylation or methylation of promoter of specifics genes, for example, the methylation in the promoters associated to tumor suppressor genes turn off this genes, the growth is not controlled, and this could  generate a tumor. The impact of this drug is general in the genome, I don't think be a tissue-specific.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation is mitotically heritable <span class="short_text" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span class="hps">any changes</span></span> in the DNA methylation patterns alters the expression of epigenome, the drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects last beyond of drug treatment for this reason, as the cancer the changes of this patters affect   cellular linage. These effects would be more convincing in sensitive period, which are periods where the genome or the epigenome is less “stable” , for example, in the early development and the primordial germ cells development. The treating patients in this sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the epigenome this settling down , and the effect of this drug would be more durable in the cell line.</p></div>
