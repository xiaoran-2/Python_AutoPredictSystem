<p class="western">CpG islands are genomic regions where the content of CpG dinucleotides (a cytosine base followed by a guanine base) is at least 60% of that which would be statistically expected (Bird, 2002; Takai and Jones, 2002). In the mammalian genome, approximately 40% of CpG islands are found at promoters of genes and the methylation of these CpG islands, or more precisely the CpG island shores, is involved in the silencing of gene expression  (Fatemi <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Irizarry <em>et al</em>., 2009). Methylation of CpG islands is essential for cell differentiation (e.g. tissue specific and fluctuates in time) and normal embryonic development (Jackson <em>et al</em>., 2004).</p>
<p class="western">In normal cells the CpG islands are mostly hypomethylated, whereas in cancer cells the CpG islands are mostly hypermethylated and has been described in almost every tumour type (Esteller, 2002). The loci that become hypermethylated in cancer are usually encode for tumour suppressor genes (Merlo et al., 1995; Herman et al., 1995; Gonzalez-Zulueta et al., 1995). These DNA methylation abnormalities happen very early phase of cancer and are very specific to the tumour type (Yegnasubramanian et al., 2004). </p>
<p class="western">In mammals intergenic regions and repetitive elements are globally hypermethylated to maintain genomic integrity by silencing cryptic transcription start sites and splice sites, preventing transcriptional interference, transposition and illegitimate recombination (The ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012).</p>
<p class="western">In cancer the repetitive elements and the intronic regions become hypomethylated which leads to genomic instability. Without silencing the promoters of transposons such as Alu and LINEs, these elements become mobile and also they are able to promote the transcription of the surrounding normally silenced genes as they have very strong promoters (Yang et al., 2004; Rebollo et al., 2011; Maunakea et al., 2010). Subtelomeric and pericentric heterochromatin are hypermethylated normally, but in cancer they become hypomethylated which leads to increased recombination amongst satellite-repeat-rich regions (Lehnertz et al., 2003).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>

<p class="western"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span>H19/Igf2 cluster is controlled by an imprint control region (ICR) which is encoded between Igf2 and H19 genes (Pahnis et al, 1988; Hao et al, 1993; Bartolomei et al., 1991). H19 is normally methylated on the paternal allele and the ICR region becomes also methylated by DNA methylation spreading. On the paternal allele, an insulator protein called CTCF cannot bind to the ICR region as it is methylated therefore enhancers can initiate the expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele. H19 and the ICR region on the maternal allele are unmethylated which allows the binding of CTCF to the ICR region and this insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers, therefore Igf2 is only expressed from the paternal allele (paternally imprinted). </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span>In Wilm's tumour (causing kidney cancer during childhood) H19 expression is reduced which is caused by its hypermethylation on both paternal and maternal allele while Igf2 is biallelicly expressed (Zhang et al., 1993; Moulton et al., 1994). The loss of imprinting leads to the high expression of Igf2 which results in cancer (Hu et al., 2010). Somatic defects of various loci (p53, WT1, WTX) have been implicated in Wilm's tumour (Scott et al., 2012).</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>

<p class="western">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agents, which is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p class="western">Decitabine indirectly depletes methylcytosine and causes hypomethylation of target gene promoters. (Kantarjian et al., 2003). Decitabine is a cytosine nucleoside analog that, once incorporated into DNA, inhibits further DNA methylation. As a consequence, aberrantly silenced genes in neoplastic cells, including tumor suppressor genes, can be reactivated and expressed (Kantarjian et al., 2006). <span>In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. </span>Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine (www.dacogen.com).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>                       </p>
<p class="western">Epigenetic inhibitors such as DNA demethylating agents can result in epigenetic differences that become stable for the rest of  the patients lifetime or cause changes during early pregnancy or even during gametogenesis and influences the life of the next generation. For this reason I would discourage treating patients with epigenetic inhibitors during pregnancy to avoid the emergence of epimutations in the offsprings. </p>
<p class="western">Previous work on mice has shown that the preimplantation (early embryonic development) and primordial germ cell development are highly sensitive periods when the epigenetic reprogramming occurring (Morgan et al., 1999; Morgan et al., 2005). During the sensitive periods the existing epigenetic marks are erased, except those silencing IAPs, and new marks are reset. Additionally, imprinted genes are only reset during primordial germ cell development (Blewitt et al., 2006).  Altered maternal diet (containing methyl donors and or endocrine disruptors) in mice was able to influence epigenetic makeup of the next generation (Wolff et al., 1998; Dolinoy et al., 2006).  </p></div>
