    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal function of DNA methyl at CpG islands provides stable epigenetic markers.  These are of the inactive type and tend to silence gene expression..  The Methylation is maintained thru cell division.  Disruption in cancer can occur thru maternal inheritance of the Methylation and generally progresses with time.  The contribution to cancer is Locus-specific and the  Methylation can silence Tumor Suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Normal function of DNA Methyl. in Intergenic regions and Repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity.  This includes silencing transcriptions and/or splice sites, prevents transpositions and illegal recombinations.  The disruption in cancer occurs with hypomethylation in these regions and elements, and this progresses with time.   The contribution to cancer is to genomic instability .  The instability causes any or all of the following:  gain, or loss, or recombination of chromosomes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br />Imprinting concerns how certain genes are expressed by a parent-of-specific-origin allele.<br />So in the case of the parental allele, where the ICR is normally methylated, the CTCF does not bind to the insulator and this allows the enchancers to promote the lgf2 expression.<br />For the maternal allele, where the ICR is normally unmethylated, CTCF does bind to the insulator and then the lfg2 does NOT express.</p>
<p><br />For Wilm's tumor syndrome, with loss of imprinting in the maternal ICR, hypermethylation occurs and the result is that the maternal lfg2 is expressed .<br />The double expression of lfg2 , being growth promoting, results in Wilm's tumor, a cancer </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine can be used to treat cancer because it targets certain enzymatic epigenetic regulators ( epigenetic machinery).<br />Decitabine is in a class of DNA methyltransferase Inhibitors (a DNMTi).<br />The impact of Decitabine is to inhibit Mutated DNA methyltransferase; that is, cancerous regulators. <br />Decitabine is a small molecule that binds to very specific epigenetic modifiers (DNA methyltransferase) to inhibit their function.<br />The DNMTi also is division dependent, that is, it copies the methylation to the daughter DNA strand;  the methyltransferase is really bound and can no longer released.  As the cancer cells divide much more rapidly, the cancer cells will be impacted more by the inherited DNMTi.  So, the inhibitors (DNMTi) severely limit the growth of cancer tumor cells in MDS (Myelo Dyplastic Syndrome), a precursor to AML.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs can have long lasting effects by altering DNA Methylation and passing on the effects of the DNMTi.  These DNMTi's are small molecules that bind to specific epigenetic modifiers (such as DNA Methylase)..  These changes, in turn, are division dependent and so are copied to daughter and grand daughter strands..  This has an enduring effect on the epigenome.<br />Sensitive periods are those times when cells are subject to change, especially due to their environment.  During sensitive periods, the epigenome is in a stage of active remodeling and reprogramming.  Sensitive periods of development are times from primordial germ cell development to the production of mature cells, and during embryo early development.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods is not advisable because of the effect of environmental changes, such as drugs, during normal changes such as erasures and reprogramming.</p></div>
