    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the CpG islands are most likely hypomethylated, independent on whether the gene is being expressed or not. However, in cancer, the CpG islands are hypermethylated, and therefore the gene expression is silenced. This can lead to disease in the case of tumour suppressor genes, because when they are silenced a tumour can develop. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally hypermethylated, in order to silence them, but in cancer they are hypomethylated. This can lead to activation of the repetitive regions, which disrupt genomic stability causing for example illegitimate recombinations or transpositions. In the case of CpG island poor promoters, they are normally hypermethylated, but in cancer they are hypomethylated. This can lead to te expression of oncogenes, causing the disease. Genetic instability is also a hallmark of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele has methylation of the ICR (Imprint Control Region), which makes it impossible for CTCF to bind, and therefore the enhancers cause the expression of Igf2. In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, so CTCF can bind to it, causing the enhancers to produce the expression of H19. In the case of Wilm´s tumour, both ICRs are methylated, in the paternal and maternal alleles, so the enhancers produce the expression of Igf2 in both cromosomes. As Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, the expression of double the protein in the case of the disease promotes the growth of the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The changes in the epigenome are mitotically heritable, so any change produced on DNA methylation will be passed on to the daughter cells. A sensitive period is that in which epigenetic marks are being set, for example during early embryogenesis or during primordial germ cell production. Treating patients during these periods is highly inadvisable, because the epigenetic marks need to be properly set, in a tissue-specific manner, so if you are acting on the epigenome as a whole, you can disrupt that process, and the secondary effects can be really important.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the group of DNA-methyltransferase-inhibitors. This means that it blocks the methylation of the DNA of the daughter cells during cell division. What it really does is bind the DNMT so that it can no longer do its job. It can have an anti-tumour effect by inhibiting the heritability of the hypermetyhlation of the CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes. If the hypermethylation is lost, the gene is no longer silenced and can be expressed, and suppress the tumour. </p></div>
