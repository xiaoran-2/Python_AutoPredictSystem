    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands tend to be found at the promoters of gene’s. These regions are commonly protected from methylation. However, there are some CpG islands in the genome that are found to be methylated in normal cells, resulting in silencing of gene expression.</p>
<p>On the contrary, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated in cancer cells. This is called the CpG island hypermethylation or CGI hypermetylation. These methylated CpG islands are usually in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, resulting in their silencing. Furthermore, since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, this is a very good locking down mechanism of gene expression. As a consequence, these epigenetic marks in various tumour suppressor genes can cause cancer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells probably to maintain the integrity of the genome. Methylation of the intergenic regions protects from deletions, insertions, duplications and translocations and also silences cryptic promoters and splice sites. While methylation of the repetitive elements protects from mutagenic transpositions of the own repetitive elements and, it can also prevent illegitimate recombination. In cancer, intergenic intervals and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated, observing genomic instability, causing illegitimate deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, duplications or loss of chromosomes, which can trigger the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the common features of cancer cells is that they display loss of imprinting through hyper- or hypomethylation. Therefore, genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression become either expressed from both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles, taking into account that most of these imprinted genes are involved in growth promoting or suppressing. An instance is the H19/Igf2 cluster. It is methylated on the paternal allele, allowing the enhancers act on Igf2, activating its expression. While the cluster is unmethylated on the maternal allele, allowing the enhancers act on H19, activating its expression instead of the IGF2 expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour happens that imprinting of this cluster is disrupted because the maternal allele is also methylated, resulting in the expression of IGF2. As a consequence, there is a double dose of this protein in comparison to what happens in normal cells. And, as IGF2 is a growth promoter, it activates cell proliferation, becoming these cells tumour cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and it is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. It is a nucleoside analog which is incorporated into the DNA upon replication. When the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind this nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, it can no longer be released in a irreversible way.</p>
<p>As this process is division dependent, cancer cells will be more severely affected, because they are dividing much more rapidly than other cells. So, Decitabine probably hit all dividing cells in myelodysplastic syndrome to some extent. The reason could be that this syndrome might be dependent on CpG island hypermethylation. Therefore, inhibiting methyltransferases could prevent the hypermethylation and the silencing of tumour suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs altering DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the treatment period because epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable. They passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.</p>
<p>Sentitive periods are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome, which are mainly two: primordial germ cell development through the production of mature eggs and sperm and the pre-implanted and early post-implantation development of the embryo. Furthermore, there are brief windows in time when particular organs will also have a very sensitive period because of how it develops. However they are not so sensitive in terms of the whole organism than the first two periods that I mentioned.</p>
<p>These are periods when we seem to be most sensitive to changes in the environment, such as diet and also drug treatments. Therefore, this treatments must be avoided when it is possible, due to their possible effects in the epigenetic marks and the last of these effects.</p></div>
