    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value"><div>
<p>For most genes, 2 functional copies of every autosomal gene is inherited, one from each parent. However, in a small subset only one working copy is inherited in a parent-of-origin dependent manner. This is called imprinted gene.</p>
<p>Eg: H19/Igf2 cluster, located on chromosome 11, is paternally imprinted:</p>
<p>On maternal chromosome, CTCF insulator protein binds to sites within the ICR, insulating Igf2, which codes for a growth hormone during embryonic and foetal development, from the downstream enhancers. These enhancers then act on H19, expressing them. Since the paternal chromosomes ICR is methylated the CTCF protein is unable to bind thus allowing the Igf2 to engage the enhancers.</p>
<p>Improper imprinting can lead to severe developmental abnormalities, cancer etc. Paternal Igf2 is active while the maternal copy is generally silenced with the help of a methyl group. However, in certain cases, mutation or epimutation can activate the maternal copy, resulting in 2 active copies of the gene.  Activation of the maternal gene during early development leads to Beckwith-wiedemann Syndrome. It can also occur as a result of loss of Cdkn1c gene which is a growth or tumour suppressing gene.</p>
<p>Symtoms: Overgrowth, microglossia, predisposition to embryonic/ childhood tumours- wilms tumour (kidney tumour) results because of loss of imprinting and overexpression of growth promoting genes or loss of growth suppressing genes.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<p>Decitabine or a 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine is a cytidine analog and can be produced from a benzoyl-protected chlorosugar. It’s a hypomethylating agent and acts by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). Hence belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhbitors.     </p>
<p>Decitabine is used to treat a myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. It is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and irreversibly bind to DNMT thereby inhibiting them, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells like cancer, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are periods when the environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup. Its not necessary true that the altered environment at any stage of development could result in a different phenotype or epigenetic outcome. Periods sensitive to epigenetic control are:primordial germ cell development through the mature eggs and sperm, preimplantation and early post implantation period. The time when there’s active reprogramming of epigenetic marks are the most sensitive periods.</p>
<p>Altering DNA methylation at sensitive periods can lead to changes in the epigenome that may be irreversible. DNA methylation may be altered by certain chemical in the environment and changes in the phenotype can be observed for several generations. For example, F0 generation was exposed to pesticide methoxychlor and subfertility was passed down in several generations. Also when agouti yellow male crossed with non-agouti female with altered diet (alcohol, folate) there was a change in the offsprings phenotype.</p>
<p>Treating patients during the sensitive periods is generally not advisable because cells adapt by an unknown hypothetical process that results in more permanent modiﬁcations to DNA methylation and chromatin structure, leading to enduring alteration of a given epigenetic network. Therefore, any epigenetic side effect caused by a drug may persist after the drug is discontinued and these epigenomic alterations are hard to reverse</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to DNA at the 5<sup>th</sup> position of cytosine. Appoxmately 70% of the CpG residues in the mammalian genome are methylated. DNA methylation has been shown to be essential for normal development, X-chromosome inactivation, imprinting, silences the tumor suppressor genes in cancer. CpG islands are protected from methylation in normal cells. When methylation occurs in the promoter region of a growth-regulatory gene it can act as one of the steps in the Knudson `two-hit' model of tumor formation.</p>
<p>The function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity. Cells that lack Dnmt1 exhibit genomic instability that leads to loss of chromosomes, reciprocal translocations, insertions etc. They also play a role in silencing cryptic splice sites or transcription start sites.</p>
<p>The function of repetitive elements is more or less the same as intergenic regions of maintaining genomic stability, which can be achieved by silencing the repeats so as to prevent mutagenic transposition. The others function is to avoid transcription interference from strong promoters and by methylating illegitimate recombinations.</p>
<p>It has been recognized that methylation patterns in tumor cells are altered relative to those of the normal cells. A global hypomethylation of the genome is accompanied by region-specific hypermethylation. i.e. in contrast to the normal cells, the cancer cells have intergenic region as well as the repetitive elements hypomethylated, whereas the CpG islands in most cases are found to be hypermethylated. Hyperethylation may lead to silencing of the tumor suppressor genes in cancer. Example: promoter-region methylation of the retinoblastoma (<em>pRB</em>) gene have been documented in familial cases of unilateral retinoblastoma. Hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repeptitive elements may activate them, therby allowing them to cause illegitimate recombinations that may lead to fatal diseases including cancer.</p></div>
