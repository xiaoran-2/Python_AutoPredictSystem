    <div class="field-value"><div>Methylation of CpG islands is usually associated with transcriptional silencing of a gene and so reduction in the expression of the protein. In normal tissue the global methylation level is higher and the methylation of CpG islands is lower. As a cancer advances to metastasis the level of global methylation decreases and the methylation of CpG islands increases. CpG island shores, the 2kb of DNA on either side of a CpG island, are also hyper methylated in cancers. There are also specific areas of methylation found in different cancers (cDMRs- cancer differently methylated regions).</div>
<div> </div>
<div> Many of the CpG islands that are hypermethylated are in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. This means that the tumour suppressor genes are inactivated, allowing proliferation and growth of the cancer cells. The increase in methylation of CpG islands could knock out both copies of a tumour suppressor gene and indeed affect several different genes. An example of a tumour suppressor gene that can be silenced due to DNA methylation is the retinoblastoma gene.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Methylation in interagenic regions and repeats usually reduces the movement of transposable elements and ensures that repeats are transcriptionally silenced. DNA methylation maintains genetic stability. However, DNA methylation of repetitive elements, intergenic regions and also introns in cancer cells is reduced.  This activates cryptic promoters, causing disruption of  nearby genes. It causes illegitimate recombination between repetitive elements and hence  translocations between chromosomes that are not a pair or in regions that do not share genetic identity, thereby disrupting gene expression. Repetitive elements canmbe activated due to hypomethylation and so they can be transposed around the genome. This can result in disruption of gene coding regions and also activation of nearby genes. Examples would be the agouti gene and axin gene which are both activated by a strong promoter in a repetitive element. There is also hypomethylation in CpG poor promoters and this can lead to activation of oncogenes such as R-RAS in gastric cancer.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div> There is marked hypermethylation or hypomethylaton of imprint control regions in cancer cells and this leads to a loss of imprinting. In the h19/igf2 cluster the paternal allele in a normal cell is methylated on the ICR and so H19 is not active and the enhancers can act on the igf2 gene, thereby activating its expression. Meanwhile on the maternal allele in a normal cell the ICR is unmethylated. This means that CTCF insulator element can bind to the ICR. This leads to silencing of igf2 because the enhancers now act on the H19 gene instead of igf2. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In wilms tumour the maternal allele is also methylated and so igf2 is actively expressed from both alleles, leading to a double dose effect. igf2 is a growth promoter and so an increase in the expression of igf2 leads to cell growth and proliferation and further development of cancer cells. </div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<div>Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. It is a DNA de-methylation agent and binds to the active site of the enzyme DNMT, which is responsible for methylation of DNA. It is therefore a DNA methylation inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogue and when DNMT binds to the DNA strand in order to methylated it is irreversibly bound to the decitabine and cannot be released, hence reducing DNA methylation. It inhibits DNA methyl transferase so leads to hypomethylation of the DNA. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The reduction of the hypermethylation found at CpG islands in tumours would 'switch back on' the tumour suppressor genes that had been silenced, thereby causing the cell the revert to 'normal' expansion of tumour suppressor genes. This would reduce the cel growth, proliferation and enable cell death to occur as it does in a normal cell.</div>
</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>epigenetic changes can be mitotically heritable and therefore can be passed on to daughter cells. it is believed that GSK2816126, an inhibitor of EZH2, lays down epigenetic marks that are inherited in this way and therefore affect the daughter cells. This means it can be used to stop the cancer cells from growing without having to kill all the cells. </div>
<div> </div>
<div> A sensitive period is one where the epigenome is very easily altered, such as during early embryogenesis and maturation of the germ cells.<span>There may be removal of epigenetic marks during cell differentiation too, for example in hematopoietic progenitors when they differentiate into blood cells. </span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>During these times epigenetic clearing and reprogramming takes place. Interference with the reprogramming would cause changes across the epigenome that would affect the gene expression of the individual into adulthood and in all cells. This could lead to activation of genes that would normally be silenced, increase genomic instability and have wide spread consequences throughout the organism. In particular treatment of young patients, in whom germ cells are still developing, would be of concern as changes to the epigenetic machine and the epigenome would then possibly be passed onto children via the gametes.</div></div>
