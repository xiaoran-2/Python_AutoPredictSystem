    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the most scrutinized epigenetic marks and in the case of cancer shows characteristic patterns unique to transformed cells.</p>
<p>     In normal cells CpG islands are usually maintained in an unmethylated state. Methylation of these CpG islands especially in the context of gene promoters is associated with gene suppression. In cancer, these CpG islands are predominantly hypermethylated and it is believed that this aberrant methylation can lead to suppression of tumour suppressor genes eg: p53. These genes are essential for maintaining normal cell function and the loss of this function leads to cancer.</p>
<p>       In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are in a relatively hypermethylated state. This epigenetic state is essential for genomic stability, as methylation prevents these elements from aberrantly translocating, crossing over, etc and disrupting the genome. Also, methylation of intergenic regions is essential for transcription, splicing and other cellular processes occurring normally. In cancer, these intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not methylated and manifests as a genome wide hypomethylated state. This hypomethylation has been shown to cause large scale genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer.</p>
<p>        Both these abnormalities in DNA methylation can lead to mistargetting of other epigenetic regulators. Also, significantly altering nuclear architecture and thus gene regulation. All these epigenetic insults can synergistically increase the chances of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>     The H19/Igf2 cluster is an excellent example of genomic imprinting; i.e. parent of origin specific expression of genes. In humans H19 gene is expressed only from the maternal allele and Igf2 only from the paternal allele and this arises because of different methylation marks present on both these alleles.</p>
<p>    There exists an imprint control region (ICR)upstream of the H19 gene. At paternal alleles this ICR is methylated blocking its insulator function and hence the shared enhancer drives expression of the Igf2 gene. At maternal alleles however the ICR is not methylated this allows the insulator protein CTCF to bind and prevent expression of Igf2 but in turn allow expression of H19. Thus normal cells get a single dose of both genes.</p>
<p>    In the case of Wilm`s tumor there is aberrant hypermethylation of both alleles, resulting in the expression of Igf2 from both alleles rather than just from the paternal allele. As a result, the cells effectively receive a double dose of this growth factor, effectively functioning now as a mitogen i.e. tumour inducer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>   Decitabine is a small molecule drug targeted at enzymatic epigenetic regulators, more specifically it belongs to a class of drugs called Dnmt inhibitors.</p>
<p>  Decitbine is essentially a cytosine nucleotide analogue i.e. it resembles the normal C nucleotide and gets an incorporated into DNA. However once in DNA and targeted by Dnmt for methylation, decitabine binds and locks Dnmt thereby inhibiting its function.</p>
<p>   Cancerous cells show CpG hypermethylation and genome wide hypomethylation. Decitabine effectively reduces DNA methylation and thus helps recover to some extent normal gene function, especially hypermethylated tumour suppressors. Decitabine is not targeted and can incorporate into the DNA of normal as well as cancerous cells. However cancer cells owing to their higher rate of replication are more susceptible and at lower doses the drug is also more specific. It can also be used synergistically with other epigenetic drugs or routine chemotherapeutic drugs.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>    Epigenetic modifications encompass functional relevant changes to the genome barring sequence alterations, which are mitotically heritable. Thus DNA methylation once established can be stably inherited by all the daughter cells owing to the maintenance function of dnmt enzymes. These epigenetic marks are thus susceptible to drug mediated modifications and thereafter retained permanently altering the epigenome (until reprogramming).</p>
<p>   Sensitive periods refer to the stages of development in the life of an organism when epigenetic marks are being actively established and altered. These sensitive periods are important because they influence at a systemic level the state of either the organism itself or its progeny i.e. if development progresses normally or not. There are several stages when external stimuli can effect such change; namely early development, primordial germ cell development and childhood.</p>
<p>    Treating patients during sensitive periods is potentially dangerous because drugs targeting epigenetic regulators are nonspecific. But more importantly epigenetic marks are established in a fine balance of activation and suppression at several layers and in a tissue specific fashion. Current strategies for therapy cannot possibly effect such immense complexity in a precise enough fashion for it to be safe. Hence it is inadvisable.</p></div>
