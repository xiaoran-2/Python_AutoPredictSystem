    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA alterations during cancer occur in two main ways, locus specific DNA hypermethylation or genome wide hypomethylation.  In locus specific DNA hypermethylation, CpG islands of promoters or shores of tumour suppressor genes of normally non methylated islands are hypermethylated, where as the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are demethylated. These events result in the silencing of tumour suppressor genes that prevents tumour formation. In genome wide hypomethylation, demethylation of CpG island poor promoters results in the activation of oncogenes. The hypo methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements results in genomic instability.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The hypermethylation of imprint control regions results in the loss of imprinting either by expression of both parental alleles or silencing of both alleles. In the example of Wilm’s tumour, the ICR on both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated. On the paternal allele as per normal would express lgf2. On the maternal allele now without CTCF would not allow H19 expression with methylation of H19 resulting in the expression of Igf2. An overexpression of Igf2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that target and inhibit DNA methyltransferases used in Myelodysplasic syndrome that has progressed to AML. It is a nucleoside analogue that irreversible binds and incorporates into DNA upon replication. This acts on fast replicating tumour cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation can be inherited to daughter cells or even granddaughter cells. Perhaps alterations of parental epigenome could have enduring effects. A sensitive period is when the epigenetic marks are being established rather than maintained. These periods are during embryogenesis and gametogenesis. Exposure of epigenetic modifiers during sensitive periods could result in marks or effects that would be continued and carried over several generations.</p></div>
