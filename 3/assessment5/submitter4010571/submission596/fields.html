    <div class="field-value"><p>In healthy cells, most CpG islands are protected against methylation, however, a small number of CpG islands can become methylated, this DNA methylation at CpG islands serves to silence gene expression and can also be involved in X inaxtivation in females. In cancer cells we see hypermethylation of CpG islands meaning that far more of the CpG islands are methylated. This can result in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. As DNA methylation is mitotically heritable the silencing of tumor suppressor genes can be passed down to daughter cells which, often in conjunction with other epigenetic abberations and/or genetic mutations, can cause the formation of a tumor. Methylation does not only occur at CpG islands. In a healthy cell the majority of intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in order to maintain genomic integrity. In intergenic regions this is achieved through silencing of criptic splice or transcription start sites while in repetitive elements repeats are silenced to prevent transcriptional interference from strong promoters and to stop the production of Gag and Pol proteins and therefore prevent transposition of repeats throughout the genome. The methylation of repeats in a healthy cell also prevents illigitimate recombination, the complimentary base pairing of sections of DNA that should not be paired. In cancer cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated, they lack methylation, this is most common at repeats. Without methylation we see illigitimate recombination of repeats, activation of repeats, allowing them to be transposed to other parts of the genome, activation of cryptic promoters and chromosome alterations such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocation. In short, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to an abnormal karyotype and general genomic instability. This, in turn, can cause uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating or hypomethylating agent, more specifically, it is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). Chemically, decitabine is an anolog of the nucleoside cytidine. This allows it to be incorporated into DNA where it irreversibly binds the DNA methyltransferase, inhibiting the methyltransferase's action and thereby reducing the methylation on subsequently replicated strands of DNA. Cancer cells often exhibit hypermethylation at CpG islands causing silencing of tumor suppressor genes. During replication if decitabine is present the DNA methyltransferases are unable to methylate the new strand so the hypermethylation ceases to be mitotically heritable and the uncontrolled cell proliferation that would otherwise lead to a tumor is reduced or stopped completely as tumor suppressor genes are no longer silenced. Decitabine lacks specificity, however, it has a greater effect on cancer cells as its anti-tumor action is replication dependant and cancer cells tend to replicate more often.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. When DNA is replicated we get a methylated parent strand paired with an unmethylated daughter strand, this is called hemi-methylated DNA. The enzyme DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) preferentially selects for hemi-methylated DNA and lays down methylation on the daughter strand. Therefore, if the pattern of DNA methylation is altered in the parent cell then when it divides and replicates its DNA, the daughter cell will have altered DNA methylation too. DNA methylation is particularly susceptible to change during sensitive periods, times of epigenetic reprogramming where epigenetic marks are being cleared and reset, for example, in vitro culture, preimplantation/early development and primordial germ cell development. Therefore it would not be wise to treat patients with DNA methylation altering drugs during these sensitive periods as DNA methylation could be permanently altered and passed on through many generations of cells. If changes in DNA methylation were to occur in the gametes then they could be passed on to further generations of children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster: in a healthy cell the imprinting control region on the maternal allele is unmethylated allowing CTCF to bind and prevent the enhancers from accessing and activating the Igf2 gene, lgf2 is therefore not expressed from the maternal allele. On the paternal allele, however, the imprinting control region is methylated, CTCF cannot bind and the enhancers are free to act upon the Igf2 gene which is expressed. If this imprinting is lost the both the maternal and paternal alleles will express Igf2 which, when over produced, is an oncogene, this will lead to the growth of a tumor.</p></div>
