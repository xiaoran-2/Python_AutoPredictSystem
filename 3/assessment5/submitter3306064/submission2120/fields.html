    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, there are DNA hypomethylation at CpG islands. In general terms this profile at the level of <em>locus</em> specific gene promoter allows the transcription of the gene, for instance, at the promoter of tumor suppressor gene. However, in the context of cancer cells, there are <em>locus</em> specific DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands (are more likely to be methylated), this epigenetic profile at the gene promoter site indicates that the gene are silenced (as a result the cells can`t control their replication). In this way the cancer cell can silencing one tumor suppressor gene, but to become in a cancer cell, it´s necesary more insults to the epigenome (more promoter genes hypermethylated) and the genome, and since this epigenetic mark is mitotically heritable, so this out of control is maintained through generations of cell division, in fact, the hypermethylation at CpG island progresses with time. </p>
<p>Another observation in normal cells, is referred to the existence of DNA methylation in the intergenic regions, repetitive elements and in . This epigenetic profile are associated with maintaining of genomic stability. When this site are hypomethylated, there are a genomic instability, which can cause by illegitimate recombination between the repeat elements (the chromosomes has not a normal pair in the cross-over in cell división), also there is activation of the repeats elements and transposition. In consequence, this can trigger an abnormal karyotype due this genomic instability (deletions of tumor suppressor or DNMT3B, insertions of oncogenes)</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are different sort of disruption that can contribute to cancer, in the case of imprinted genes, we can cited the hypermthylation of H19/Igf2 cluster, which y associated with growth promoter. This is a imprinted region, where the<strong> </strong>imprint control region (ICR) in the paternal allele is methylated,  as result the CTCF can´t binds to ICR and the enhancer can act to Igf2 resulting in the expression of these gene. In the case of the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, which allow CTCF to bind and insulate the ICR, and the enhancers act on H19 (allow its expression) and silence Igf2.</p>
<p>When there are loss of imprinting in the ICR (hypermethylation in both alleles), there are overexpression of Igf2, wich is associated with overdose of this growth promoter and the development of <span>Wilm’s tumour (childhood kydney tumor).</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In clinical practice, the are several drugs that affect cancer epigenetics. One of the drugs<span> used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes</span> is the Decitabine, which belongs to DNA-demethylating agents. This drug i<span>inhibit the activity of an enzyme called</span> DNMT(Decitabine binds it in a irreversible way), this enzyme is responsible for the transference of methyl-groups to position C5 on the citosine in presence of CpG, in this way there DNMT enzymes that can methylate the DNA <em>de novo</em> or maintain the methylation after cell division in the daughter cells. This drug have an anti-tumour effect, because during the division of the cancer cell this DNMT<em> </em>will not transfered this epigenetic mark to the daughter cells, making this epigenetic state during the next generations of cell division reversible and erased them without <span>having to kill all its cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetics drugs have an interesting results in the treatment of cancer diseases, but it has a several consequences in all epigenome, because this drugs have a lack of specificity and can alter the normal cells, it still a concern due the lack of knowledge of their mechanism of action. Also, the scientist not recomended treat the patient in sensitivity periods of development such as childhood (in germ cells) and embryonic development, because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and the ther cell generations until they are actively erased and they do not return, which can causes, in long term, several abnormalities in the epigenome </p></div>
