    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin.</p>
<p>Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state.</p>
<p>Epigenetic changes during cancer include a genome-wide loss (hypo methylation) and a regional gain of DNA methylation (hyper methylation) of CpG islands. This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue speciﬁc and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes - controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands. Finally all these changes makes an individual prone to diseases.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements plays an important role in maintaining genomic integrity by avoiding illegitimate recombination, transcriptional interference and transposition of repeats in normal cells.  Where as in cancer cells hypo methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements results in genomic instability by activation of cryptic promoters and transposition, illegitimate recombination between repeats resulting in abnormal karyotypes and diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In case of H19/Igf2 cluster, Imprinted control region (ICR) is methylated on paternal chromosome and unmethylated on maternal chromosome in normal cells.  Generally DNA methylation at LCR blocks binding of CTCF, which is an insulator protein helps in insulating Igf2 from downstream enhancers.</p>
<p>Therefore DNA methylation at ICR of paternal allele blocks binding of CTCF such that there is no insulator action by it and these downstream enhancers can access Igf2 to activate its expression since preferred loop is between Igf2 and enhancers.</p>
<p>Similarly in case of maternal allele which is unmethylated at ICR, CTCF can bind to it which in turn insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers resulting in blocking Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, H19/Igf2 cluster ICR is hyper methylated on in contrast to normal cells, therefore ICR is methylated in both maternal and paternal alleles  such that CTCF can’t bind to show its insulator action and now we can observe double dose of Igf2 expression when compared to normal cell since it is expressed from both alleles. Since Igf2 have growth promoting effects and its overexpression can result in various growth disorders like Wilms’s tumour and diseases. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to class of DNA-demethylating agents (DNMT inhibitors), sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. </p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analog. It binds DNMTs irreversiblly after they are incorporated into DNA and therefore they are replication dependent.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent and it <span style="font-size:14px;">hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase activity.  It functions in a similar manner to azacitidine, although decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands. Its incorporation into DNA leads to a covalent binding with DNA methyltransferases, which prevents DNA synthesis and subsequent cytotoxicity resulting anti-neoplastic activity. In this way demethylation can activate tumor suppressor genes resulting in anti-tumour effect.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes (changes in methylation pattern) are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is a more extended period of time during development when an individual is more receptive to specific types of environmental stimuli. Early development (fertilized egg to blastocyst stage) and germ cell development are two sensitive periods of development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods is not recommended since epigenetics changes that are created to cure the patient may not be passed to next generation since epigenetic marks are removed and reestablished during these periods.</p></div>
