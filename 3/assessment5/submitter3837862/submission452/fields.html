    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG islands, which are usually at the promoters of genes, are unmethylated.  Being unmethylated allows the promoters to attach and transcribe the genes that are usually tumour suppressors.  In cancer cells the CpG islands are methylated preventing trascription factor binding, leading to silencing of tumour suppressor genes.  In normal cells the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are methylated which keeps the DNA compacted protecting it from genomic instability.  In cancer cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated leading to genomic instability.  Genomic instability is when there are illegitimate recombinations between repeats and when repeats make copies of themselves that move around in the genome. These changes lead to genes being switched around, deleted, or inserted into the genome leading to the activation of the wrong genes or preventing other genes from being expressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele the imprint control region(ICR) is methylated preventing CTCF from binding.  Without CTCF binding the enhancers work on Igf2 gene leading to its expression.  The normal methylation pattern for the maternal allele is to be unmethylated allowing CTCF to bind.  CTCF binding prevents the enhancers from working on Igf2 and instead they work on H19 leading to its expression.  In Wilm's tumour the maternal imprinting is changed to the ICR being methylated.  This methylation prevents CTCF from binding, just like in the paternal allele.  This causes over expression of Igf2, which is a growth promoting gene, causing the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNMT inhibitor that binds to DNMT preventing DNA from being methylated.  If a tumour is caused by hypermethylation of a tumour suppressor gene, then using Decitabine can prevent DNMT from methylating the gene.  The tumour would be suppressed due to the tumour suppressor gene being expressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last after the treatment because the DNA methylation is maintained in the cell.  When the cell divides the resulting cells will have an original strand of DNA and a copy.  The original strand will maintain its methylation pattern.<br />Drugs that alter DNA methylation do not just effect the target cells, but all cells in the patient.  Because of this it also effects the germ cells.  If the patient is at an age where spermatogenesis or oogenesis is happening or during pre-implantation of early pregnancy they should not be treated with these drugs.  During these sensitive periods when epigenetic reprogramming is happening, treatment with these drugs could lead to improper epigenetic reprogramming.  This improper methylation of the genome, such as both paternal and maternal alleles having the same imprinting, could result in embryo death, cancer, or other problem throughout the life of the child.</p></div>
