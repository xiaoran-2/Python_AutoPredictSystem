    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">In the epigenetically typical mammalian cell, DNA methylation occurs infrequently at CpG islands and when it does, it generally functions to silence the expression of promoter genes. Conversely in a typical /normal cell, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements typically contain considerable DNA methylation. This packs these regions more tightly (heterochromatin) and silences transcription of these regions. Professor Timothy Bestor has proposed a “Genome Defense Theory”, asserting that DNA methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions protects the integrity of the genome (replication fidelity and accuracy) by preventing transpositions, duplications, and recombination errors.</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">In contrast, in a tumor (cancer) cell, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements have lost DNA methylation while the CpG islands have excessive DNA methylation. This hyper-methylation can spread beyond the CpG islands into near shores, silencing gene expression in surrounding areas. If the CpG island is adjacent to a promoter for a gene or cluster of genes involved in tumor-suppression, the cell loses this suppression capacity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The hypo-methylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements increases genomic instability by increasing the possibility of mutations in the genome via replication errors. And the changes in the DNA methylation patterns in the genome also cause chromatin remodeling. The cancer cell nucleus structure no longer sequesters heterochromatin around the perimeter with the euchromatin in the center. Disorganization increases along with genomic instability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Mutations (“hits”) are increasing: mutations that favor survival and replication of the cancer cell  (by the weight of natural selection) lead to tumor growth or spreading cancer. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span>A fertilized zygote normally contains 23 paired chromosomes—with each pair containing a maternal version and a paternal version. During fetal development, epigenetic marks may be laid down differently on each allele in a process called “parent-of-origin imprinting”</span>  Some times this imprinting process can go awry with serious consequences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">One example involves the H19/ IGF2 cluster located on chromosome 11. Gene H19 codes for a long noncoding RNA that when expressed works with CTCF to bind/block the enhancer of IGF2 gene expression. IGF2 stands for Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 and is considered a major fetal growth factor.</span></p>
<p> <span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">In normal imprinting, the maternal allele of H19 is unmethylated and gene expression occurs, leading to silencing of IGF2 expression. The paternal allele of H19 is methylated and silenced, CTCF binding does not occur, the enhancer of IGF2 is active, and IGF2 gene expression is enhanced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">In Beckwith-Wiedeman Syndrome, both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated and IGF2 is overexpressed resulting in “overgrowth” syndrome. Part of BWS is an increased risk for children to develop kidney tumors, also known as Wilm's tumor—likely because of the abnormal cell growth.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Decitabine  belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors that interfere with the expression of the DNMT1 gene. Since DNMT1is involved in DNA methylation, Decitabine interferes with DNA methylation, increasing hypo (un) methylated DNA. In general terms, because abnormal hypermethylation of DNA is a noted feature of cancer cells leading to silencing of tumor-suppressor gene expression, blocking this abnormal hypermethylation allows for re-activation of silenced genes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">More specifically in the article “<span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Azacitidine and decitabine have different mechanisms of action in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines”</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span> published in the journal</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Lung Cancer: Targets and Therapy </span></span></span><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span> September 9, 2010, authors Aaron Nguyen et al propose that Decitabine increases expression of genes linked with cell differentiation (“upregulation”) and decreases expression of genes linked to the cell cycle affecting the G2/M checkpoint (“downregulation”). Hypothetically, it reverses cancer cell pluripotent- like aspect and cell skips DNA damage repair prior to mitosis.</span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">If the DNA methylation of a tumor cell is altered during drug treatment, when the tumor cell replicates and divides, the altered DNA methylation pattern could be mitotically inherited as a metastable epiallele. This effect would persist beyond initial limited drug intervention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">A “sensitive period” in epigenetic terminology refers to a period when epigenetic alternations can affect  somatic cell gene expression in the parent generation (developing embryo) and primordial germ cell gene expression in offspring (succeeding generations). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">In humans, these sensitive periods of development would be early gestation as zygotes differentiate into somatic cells. And again as soma cells are cleared of epigenetic imprinting to be reset as primordial germ cells. These PGC are, in turn, parent-of-origin imprinted through epigenetic reprogramming. Also the period just prior to sexual maturation is also a sensitive period for epigenetic alterations to have inheritable effects on the immature gametes.</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Since drugs that alter DNA methylation do not specifically target only cancer cells, a drug that interferes with DNMT1 expression could have serious side-effects potentially affecting viability of developing embyros by impacting cell differentiation and leading to arrested development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">This has been the case with DNMT1 knockdown mice.</span></p></div>
