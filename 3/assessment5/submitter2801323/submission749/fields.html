    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer by losing monoallelic parent-of-origin expression of genes, like in the H19/Igf2 cluster where the inhancer is blocked.</p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster normally has a methylated imprint control region (ICR) at the paternal allele. Since the ICR is methylated it blocks the insulator protein CTCF from binding, without the CTCF the methylation will spread to H19, which is a CpG island promoter, and silence it. Since the H19 promoter is silenced the enhancers will promote expression of Igf2 on the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Normally the maternal allele has unmethylated ICR, which means the protein CTCF can bind and insulate the Igf2 from downstream enhancers. The enhancers will instead work on lncRNA H19 promoter, and enhance its expression on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>So H19 is normally expressed from the maternal allele, Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, with loss of imprinting, hypermethylation of the maternal allele, means that the CTCF protein isn’t insulating the Igf2, and since the prefered chromatin loop is between enhancers and Igf2, the maternal allele will also express Igf2. We get a double dose of Igf2, which is an oncogene, a growth promoter.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Most drugs for treating cancer targets enzymatic epigenetic regulators. Decitabine is a drug belonging to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) class of epigenetic inhibitors which can be used to treat cancer. Mostly used for haematological malignancies.</p>
<p>Decitabine hypermethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. The drug is incorporated into the DNA upon replication and then the DNMT1 comes along to bind to the nucleoside, then copy the methylation to the daughter strand. The DNMT is irreversibly bound, it can no longer be released. The action of these DNMT inhibitors is division dependent. Cancer cells divides faster then other cells and will therefore be more affected then normal cells since they replicate more. But normal cells will probably also be affected.</p>
<p>            In low doses there seem to be a good anti-neoplastic effect, it kills tumour cells because it causes DNA methylation, also in some cases of solid tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dna methylation in cancer cells are different from what we find in normal cells. The function of DNA methylation of CpG islands is, more or less, silencing of gene expression, as for example seen in the inactive X chromosome in females.</p>
<p>Methylation in CpG islands is assosiated with condensed chromatin with the help of the proteins MeCP 1-2 and of preventing binding of regulatory factors. In cancer the methylation of CpG islands increase, they become hypermethylated, which means that gene expression is inhibited. We have methylation of activation marks, tumour suppressor genes are silenced by hypermethylation</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells, and therefore help maintain genomic stability. The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements are to silence repeats to prevent translocations and to avoid transcriptional interference, mutations of repeats to prevent transposition, and prevent illegitimate recombinations. Repetitive elements that are not methylated will “jump around” in the genome.  In cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements lose their methylation, become hypomethylated, and thereby create genomic instability. And activation of cryptic promoters, disruption of neighbouring genes. So in cancer there is insertions, duplications, illegitimate delitions, reciprocal translocations, even loss of chromosomes. Illegitimate recombinations happen because they are not heavily packed in heterochromatin, repeats can copy themselves and “jump around”.</p>
<p>So in cancer we see that CpG islands are hypermethylated while the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated. It causes genomic instability and silencing of tumour suppressor genes by hypermethylating their promotor CpG islands.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter the DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome by altering gene expression. The epigenetic changes that are made are passed on to the daugther cells when the cell divides, so these changes will keep on being in the cells until the epigentic marks are activly erased. That is why the drugs have an effect even when the patient no longer uses them.</p>
<p>What is meant by a sensitive period is the reprogramming period, when the clearing and resetting of the epigenetic marks happens. The sensitive periods in development are in germ cell development all the way throught to the production of gametes (mature eggs and sperm) and in early embryonic development. Treating patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation during these sensitive periods when the reprogramming occurs, would be inadvisable because the epigenetic marks would be altered, and the expression of genes would be different from normal in these developing cells. The alterations to the DNA methylation that the drugs make, may be inherited by offsprings. </p></div>
