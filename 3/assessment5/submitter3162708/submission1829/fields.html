    <h1>Submission 1829 from Anon (session_user_id: 41a62e34f4ed79541550cb95e1215f0a4c3f4023)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that is sold under the name "Dacogen" <span>by a Japanese company. It is a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor that has been approved by the FDA for use in myelodisplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. It is a nucleoside analog that can be incorporated into the DNA upon replication and then bounds irreversibly to DNMT1, inhibiting its methylase activity from that point onwards. It is unknown if this is its only mechanism of action, and it might be dependent on CpG island hypermethylation. Although at high doses it has a toxic nonspecific effect, at far lower doses (the ones that are been used currently) it has an anti-neoplastic effect and kills the tumor cells. An advantage of this drug is that it is extremely well tolerated by older patients, given them </span>a far superior life expectancy and improving their quality of life.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Although CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation</span><span>, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated. It in turn causes silencing of the underlying gene i.e. <span>silencing of tumor suppressor genes. The hypermethylation of CpG islands has been<span> associated with diverse clinicopathological characteristics such as patient age, gender, tumor location, microsatellite instability and genetic mutation in certain</span><span> genes</span><span>.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer. H19/Igf2 is an example of a cluster of imprinted genes, whose expression is controlled by enhancer blocking. The imprint control region (ICR) of this cluster is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele, i.e it is paternally imprinted. When the ICR is unmethylated, as in the maternal allele, it is bounded by an insulator protein called CTCF. CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers, so the enhancers are free to act on H19. On the paternal allele, CTCF does not bind to ICR because it is methylated, and therefore the enhancers are able to promote Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>Igf2 is an oncogene: it promotes growth. If fact, many imprinted genes are involved in controlling growth. If for some reason you have two alleles that behave like the paternal allele, you produce too much Igf2 and promote growth a lot. One of the reasons it can occur is by epigenetic disruption of DNA methylation imprints, and a hallmark of cancer is the loss of imprinting via hypermethylation of ICRs. It can derive in the production of Wilm's tumours.</p>
<p>The disruption of imprinting in the H19/Igf2 cluster also causes Beckwith Wiedermann syndrome. This syndrome is associated with predisposition to embryonic/childhood tumours e.g. Wilm's tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Altering DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome because it is transmitted mitotically from cell to cell. A sensitive period is a period of development in wich the cell are more susceptible to environmental signals, such as the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development.<span> Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it can have unpredictable consequences on the life not only of the treated organism but on the future generations as well.</span></span></p></div>
