    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many CpG islands are located near tumor suppressor genes. DNA methylation does not normally occur at these locations. These islands function to help promote tumor suppressor genes. In cancer, tumor suppressor genes can become silenced. Silencing of this sort oftentimes occurs more frequently than mutations. DNA methylation in cancer can disrupt the promotion of tumor suppressors--leading to a higher tumor incidence rate.</p>
<p>Global DNA methylation in normal cells is common in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In cancer, however, hypomethylation can occur in intergenic regions and repetitive elements that would otherwise be methylated. In the presence of euchromatin, this can result in incorrect DNA recombination between repeats. Additionally, an activation of what would be silent repeats can instead promote silent genes or jump to other locations in the genome. This can lead to various genomic instability caused by deletions, reciprocal translocations, and insertions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele. This prevents CTCF from binding and insulating the ICR which results in methylation of H19 and Igf2 expression. The imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated on the maternal allele. This allows CTCF to bind and insulate which allows enhancers to act on H19 while silencing Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, loss of imprinting leads to hypermethylation at the imprint control region on both the maternal and paternal allele. This results in Igf2 expression from both the maternal and paternal alleles whereas Igf2 is normally only expressed from the paternally inherited allele.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It decreases DNA methylation by trapping them in a covalent complex on DNA by preventing the β-elimination step of catalysis, thus resulting in the enzymes' degradation [1]. In this way, it removes methylation which would normally be sustained due to mitotic heritability. Decitabine works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow [2].</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in order for decitabine to be effective, it must incorporate into the genome of the cell and can cause mutations if this cell does not die. In addition, it is toxic to the bone marrow [1]. Therefore, the window for therapy with decitabine is small.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have lasting effects due to the mitotic heritability of methylation in mammals. In this way, changing either the methylation of a cell or blocking the DNA methyltransferase can result in effects that cascade to the daughter cells. As a result, these changes <em>may</em> cause other effects as well.</p>
<p>A sensitive period of development is a time in which cells may become sensitive to chemotherapy. During this stage, the cells are dividing faster than they do normally. If a patient is treated with chemotherapy during a sensitive period, it could cause permanent bone marrow damage.</p></div>
