    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands present at promoters are usually not methylated. Only those genes that are specifically silenced in each cell type have their CpG islands methylated. When a normal cell is tranformed into a cancer cell, one of the changes that can be observed is that cell shows methylation at most of their CpG islands. This methylation can lead to the silence of Tumour Suppressors genes, in the same way that acts a genetic mutation, contributing to the development of the cancer disease. It is known now that methylation of CpG islands increases as cancer progreses and that there are different patterns of specific CpG islands methylated in different tumour types. On an opposite way, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally more methylated in normal cells than in cancer cells, and this hypomethylation is more remarkable as cancer progresses. The methylation of both intergenic regions and repetitive elements seems to be involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity. It has been shown that in mouse models and in human diseases like ICF syndrome, the induced hypomethylation of the genome produces genomic instability. One of the characteristic of cancer cells is indeed the appearance of different types of genomic alterations, thus being easy to make an association between hypomethylation and the increase in the frequency of these alterations found in cancer. Hypomethylation of genome can also affect poor promoters, and resulting in activation of oncogenes or the expression of microRNA that can inactivate tumour suppressor genes, contributing to the appearance of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can be produced either by hypo or hypermethylation events. In this particular case, the H19/Igf2 cluster, the loss of imprinting that leads to the formation of a tumour is caused by hypermethylation of the Imprinting Control Region (ICR). In this cluster, the normal situation is that only paternal allele is methylated at the ICR, impairing the union of CTCF to the ICR and allowing the enhancers to produce the expression of Igf2. On the contrary, the absence of methylation on the ICR leads to the adhesion of CTCF and the expression of H19 driven by the enhancers, which cannot access to the Igf2 promoter resulting in the silence in the expression of Igf2 in the maternal allele. In Wilm’s tumour, the maternal allele ICR is also methylated, resulting in a double expression of the Igf2 gene, one from the paternal and one from the maternal allele. It also produces a loss of the activity of H19 gene. Igf2 gene activity is to promote growth while H19 gene activity is to restrain growth, and the loss of the imprinting regulation of both genes lead to overgrowth and an increased risk of tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). There are two types of DNMT, <em>de </em>novo and maintenance DNMT. In this case we will focus on maintenance DNMT. By inhibiting DNMT it prevents the inheritance of methylation in CpG islands after the replication process. In this sense, the anti-tumour effect can be produced by the recovering in the expression of Tumour Suppression genes or other genes involved in the control of cell differentiation and proliferation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA methylation patterns are inherited during cell division. This means that if we can modify the methylation pattern by using drugs, these changes can be maintained and inherited to the next generation after cell cycles. However there are periods in the development that are characterized by an active remodeling of the epigenetics marks like DNA methylation. These periods so called sensitive periods include the early embryonic development events from fertilization to implantation, and also the formation of the gametes. During the sensitive periods the epigenetics marks are removed and the general pattern is reestablished. Any interference during these periods can result in an alteration of the imprinting marks that can be fatal for the development of the individual. They are called sensitive periods because is during these moments that an external exposure, like the diet, can modify the correct pattern of imprinting. This make these periods inadvisable for the use of those types of drugs. </span></p></div>
