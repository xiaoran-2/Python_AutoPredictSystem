    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands present in the promoter regions of some genes are hypomethylated to keep genes like the tumor suppressor genes active. However cancer cells show an opposite picture. The CpG islands in the promoters of genes are hypermethylated to silence genes that prevent the progressions of cells from benign to malignant state. For example, hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene, RB, in retinoblastoma results in the silencing of the RB gene. This results in the transorfmation of the normals cells to tumor cells. In addition, regions approximately 2kb apart from the CpG islands, called the CpG shores are also targets for hypermethylation in cancer cells.</p>
<p>In normal cells, methylation of intergenic and repetitive regions controls the expression of certain genes. For example, the methylation status of the Imprinting Control Region (ICR) helps maintain the monoallelic expression of the Igf2 and H19 genes in individuals. In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated to cause the genome become unstable. This results in dire consequences like illegitimate recombination between different repeats, activation of cryptic promoters, disruption of neighbouring genes and activation of transposons which in turn can give an individual an abnormal karyotype. </p>
<p>Mutations in epigenetic regulators and/or chromatin modifiers like HDAC1, Dnmt1, DNMT3B cause changes in the methylation status of promoters or intergenic regions or repetitive elements in the genetic material and cause genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer can also be caused due to disruptions of imprinting. Imprinting of a gene is largely determined by the methylation status of the Imprinting Control Region (ICR).</p>
<p>In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, which prevents the transcriptional repressor CTCF from binding to it. This allows the enhancer to promote the expression of Igf2 gene. This also results in the silencing of the the H19 gene in the paternal allele.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the maternal allele, the ICR is NOT methylated. Thus, the CTCF binds to it and prevents the enhancer from accessing the Igf2 gene, thus silencing it. This leaves the H19 gene free to express itself</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the ICR is hypermethylated i.e. methylated on both the allelels. This results in the overexpression of Igf2 and complete silencing of H19. This hypermethylation could be caused due to numerous factors such as mutations in epigenetic regulators like histone deactylases, demthylases or in paternally expressed lncRNA AIR, which silences Igf2r, which binds to Igf2, thus contributing to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase, thus hypomethylating DNA. Decitabine can prevent DNA methyltransferases from hypermethylating the CpG islands and/or CpG shores. Decitabine, being a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), is a nucleoside analogue and incorporates in the DNA strand. This in turn can activate the silenced tumor suppressors and control the proliferation of tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are mitotically inheritable. Also, epigenetic drugs are non-specific. Thus, altering DNA methylation can have a long lasting and harmful effect on the epigenome. Methylation of DNA can alter gene expression depending on the lysine residue that is methylated, modify the chromatin structure, affect the methylation status of CpG islands, intergenic repeats, repetitive elements. If epigenetic drugs are given to young patients, then the therapy can alter the imprinting status of certain genes in the future generations.</p>
<p>A sensitive period of development is that stage where the individual is at his/her greatest risk to the side-effects of chemotherapeutic drugs that alter the epigenetic marks in the genome.</p>
<p>Sensitive period of development for epigenetic drugs include the period from the embryo to a young adult who plans on having children in the near future.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods is unadvisable because epigenetic modifications are mitotically inheritable and can affect the germ cells as well, leaving the next generation more vulnerable to many diseases including cancer. Epigenetic modifications are reprogrammed in the germ cells and early developmental stages. Treating patients in these stages can interfere with reprogramming and cause diseases.</p>
