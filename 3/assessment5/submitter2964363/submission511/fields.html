    <div class="field-value"><p>The main function of DNA methylation is to maintain the genomic stability of cells, keeping the integrity of their normal karyotype and appropriate control of gene expression. Methylation of DNA occurs when a methyl group binds to the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides. High frequencies of repetitive CpG sequences are called CpG islands, which are generally found in promoter regions, so that methylation of these loci is related to gene expression (Tollefsbol, 2011; Hassler; Egger, 2012). In most cases, hypermethylation of CpG islands in a gene leads to silencing of that gene activity. In normal cells, the DNA methylation pattern of tumour suppressor genes (TSG) is such that CpG islands are kept free of methylation while their intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated (Riley; Anderson, 2011). Consequently, TSGs are expressed, restricting cell growth, and the genome is kept structurally stable. On the other hand, it has been observed that CpG islands of cancer cells tend to be more methylated than normal cells, whereas intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated. These alterations lead cells to silencing of TSGs and to genomic instability, allowing deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions in chromosomes. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, as a result of these epimutations, mutated cells (cancer cells) start to replicate uncontrollably, sometimes invanding other tissues. <br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-ce47b55e16125f949b0afd3b/970238/asst-5/970238-5212586cab6bc6.39940173.pdf">Q1-References.pdf</a></p></div>

    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,

    <div class="field-value"><p>p15-INK4B is an example of a critical hematologic tumour suppressor encoded by the CDKN2B gene. Methylation of the CDKN2B promoter inactivates production of p15-INK4B and leads to myelodysplastic syndromes, like, for instance, acute myelogeneous leukemia (AML) (Riley; Anderson, 2011). Some epigenetic drugs have already been used to treat these kinds of alterations in gene expression. Decitabine (5-aza-2'deoxycytidine) is a type of DNA-demethylating agent, since it inhibits the action of DNMT enzymes. It has been reported in the literature (Daskalakis et al, 2002; <span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">The Scott Hamilton CARES Initiative, 2013</span>) that Decitabine exerts dual anti-tumour effects after being activated by <span>phosphorylation</span>:</p>

<p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic regulatory mechanism in which just one of the two alleles inherited from the parents is expressed, while the other one is silenced. This regulation is controlled by DNA methylation, and loss of imprinting (LOI) causes biallelic expression or silencing of the imprinted allele. This phenomenon has been observed in almost all tumours. A good example of how it happens can be seen in LOI of the H19/igf2 cluster, in the disrupting of Wilm's tumours. In a normal scenario, the methylation pattern of this cluster is such that the paternally-inherited igf2 allele is expressed while the maternal one is silenced. Conversely, the H19 gene is maternally expressed whereas the paternal allele is silenced. When the maternal allele ICR is hypermethylated, it prevents CTCF and its cofactors from binding, allowing enhancers to access the maternal igf2 promoter instead of the H19 promoter (Abramowitz; Bartolomei, 2012). Consequently, the maternal igf2 allele is activated and the gene is biallelically expressed, while the maternal H19 allele is silenced. Because igf2 promotes cell growth, this altered pattern of H19/igf2 expression causes uncontrolled cell proliferation in Wilm's tumour and other childhood cancers (Sullivan et al, 1999). <br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-ce47b55e16125f949b0afd3b/970238/asst-5/970238-521258753f8dc5.31192466.pdf">Q2-References.pdf</a></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a form of gene regulation which is mitotically heritable, so that characteristics are passed from mother to daughter cells (Cheng et al, 2011; Tollefsbol, 2011). It this sense, epigenetic drugs that alter DNA methylation, as discussed in Question 3, can be used to control proliferation of cancer cells and make them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy (Cancer's..., 2012). However, changes in the DNA methylation pattern can have different effects depending on the tumour stage. For instance, when tumour suppressor genes (TSG) are hypermethylated (silenced), DNA-demethylating agents appear to suppress tumorigenesis, but treatment with these kinds of drugs in stages of chromosomal instability appears to enhance tumorigenesis. Examples of this genetic instability can be found in sensitive periods, which are those of epigenetic reprogramming or, in other words, periods of the clearing of epigenetic marks. These modifications occur during early development and primordial germ cells development, when treatments with DNA-demethylating drugs would be avoided. <br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-ce47b55e16125f949b0afd3b/970238/asst-5/970238-52125890237861.05174569.pdf">Q4-References.pdf</a></p>
