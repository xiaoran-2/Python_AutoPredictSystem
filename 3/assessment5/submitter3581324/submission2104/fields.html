    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in the promoter regions of genes such as tumor suppressor genes. In normal cells these CpG islands are hypomethylated allowing the expression of these genes . Meanwhile in cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated that means that the promoter regions of genes where transcription machinary needs to bind will not be available due to methylation, resulting in the silencing of these genes. Thus if we use again the example of the tumor suppressor gene, this will be expressed in a normal cell with unmethylated CpG island at the promoter of that gene but will not be expressed in a cell with disrupted DNA methylation. The absent of expression of these tumor supressor gene is considered to be one of the hits needed for the arise of cancer.</p>
<p>In the case of intergenic regions and repetitive elements we would find them hypermethylated in normal cells, to mantain genomic stability avoiding ilegitimate recombination and chomosomal aberrations due to deletions, translocations and insertions; while in cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements would be found hypomethylated leading to genomic instability that can produce illegitimate recombination and chromosomal aberration wich are hallmarks of cancer and its emergence.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are typically found in clusters controlled by Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs). Many of these genes are involved in growth suppression or promotion, just like in the case of the H19/lgf2 cluster where Igf2 gene is a growth promoter.</p>
<p>The genes in this cluster are paternally imprinted that means that the maternal allele ICR is not methylated and because of that the CTCF protein binds to the ICR insulating the lgf2 gene, meanwhile the H19 gene expresses a long non coding RNA and the enhancers downstream act on the H19 gene rather that in lgf2 because the lather is insulated, therefore the lgf2 gene is not expressed.</p>
<p>In the paternally imprented gene since the ICR is methylated the CTCF protein will not bind to it, also the H19 gene is methylated and thus silenced so will not be expressed and so In this case the enhancers downstream will act on the Igf2 gene so it will be expressed. </p>
<p>In Wilm´s tumor there is loss of imprinting, now both the maternal and paternal ICR are methylated causing the expression of both lgf2 alleles  and therefore there is twice the amount of growth factor that in a normal cell.</p>
<p>Overexpression of growth promoting genes is found in early stages of cancer  and contributes to it by promoting cellular proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, methyltransferases are enzymes involved in the <em>de novo </em>layed down of methyl groups but also in the mitotical heredability of methylation. By inhibiting its action the methylated marks that already exist in the genome will not be inherited by subsequent generations of cells, which means that the daughter cells DNA will not be methylated.</p>
<p>This drug is used in <span>myelodysplastic syndrome wich is associated with CpG islands hypermethylation that causes silencing in the promoter regions of genes among wich we find tumor suppressor genes. So the anti-tumour effect of this drug is seen by demethylating the CpG islands on the tumor suppressor genes so that these genes can be express and work against the neoplasm by suppressing cell proliferation.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation alterations, either removal or addition of a methyl group, can have enduring effects thanks to the DNA methyltransferase 1 wich is the enzyme responsable to mantain DNA methylation and since it makes it through the restoration of the methylation from a paternal DNA strand, whatever marks are found in this paternal strand will be passed on to the daughter strand. </p>
<p>A sensitive period in development is the period when epigenetic marks are removed, reprogrammed and then layed down. There are two major sensitive periods during development:</p>
<ol><li>The period of premordial germ cell development through mature gametes production</li>
<li>Pre implantation and early post implantation period</li>
</ol><p>There are other sensitive periods that will depend on when a certain organ matures but the most important are the already mentioned.</p>
<p>Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these periods would corrupt the process of reprogramming and laying down the epigenetic marks, ruining the epigenetic control of the genome causing diseases that range from early embryonic death to infertility in the adults.</p></div>
