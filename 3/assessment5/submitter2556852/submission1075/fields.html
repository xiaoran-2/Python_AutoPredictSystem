    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>For my answer to this question, I reviewed the Epigenomics of Cancer - Emerging New Concepts article from Melanie Hassler and Gerda Egger, that was part of our required reading for this section.  A) The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is that these islands are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state.  For most areas, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression , exept for CpG islands; methylation of these areas results in the opposite effect, or an increase in gene expression.  B) In cancer, the CpG islands become hypermethylated, allowing genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes, with a corrosponding silencing of tumor supporsor genes, which normally control cell cycle, apoptosis, or DNA repair.   C) With the tumor suppressor gene silenced, errors are no longer controlled and unchecked growth can occur in any aberrant cells, leading to cancer.  D)  The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is thought to repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing. In other words, methylation prevents some errors from occuring in cell division.  E)  In cancer, this function is disrupted, tumor supressor genes are silenced, and  genomic errors can proliferate. F)  Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease in three ways:  (I) Mutations in chromatin related enzymes might induce changes in the epigenome causing global changes in chromatin. (II) Faulty targeting  or altered composition of epigenetic complexes can lead to both global and gene specific changes in the epigenetic signature. (III) Changes in the architechture of the nucleus or its boundaries could cause altered nuclear territories, disrupt normal epigenetic patterns and induce altered gene expression programs.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation at the paternal allele  at the ICR  prevents CTCF from binding, allowing <em>Igf2</em> to engage the enhancers and increase growth.  It is also required for methylation at the <em>H19</em> promoter and silencing of <em>H19.  </em>In methylation of the maternal allele, CTCF binds sites within the ICR, which generates an insulator that prevents <em>Igf2</em> from accessing the shared enhancers that are located on the <em>H19</em> side of the insulator. Thus, the insulator effectively acts as an enhancer-blocker.  The maternal and paternal allele work in a reciprocal manner.  In Wilm's tumour, the imprinting of H19, a candidate tumor suppressor gene, and IGF2, a candidate dominant oncogene are disrupted, such that H19 is inactive and IGF2 biallelically active.  Disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease when H19 is inactivated, reducing the ability of tumor suppression, and Igf2 is enhanced, allowing a greater proliferation of cancer cells.  With cell growth unchecked by H19, cancer cells can easily develop and grow. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA-demethylating agents,which are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.  Decitabine affects DNA methylation by decreasing the methylation of genes that control cell division and have been turned off.  The silencing of genes controlling cell division is what originally led to uncontrolled division of cancer cells.  Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect because it reprograms the cells so that uncontrolled division no longer occurs.  In patients successfully treated with Decitabine, the cancers cease growing and the disease may completely dissapear.  Drugs such as Decitabine are exciting because they only seem to target cancerous cell growth that is out of control, rather than the normal cell division of healthy cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterning DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, because changes to the "set of instructions" in the gene become heritable.  While an epigenetic drug may not directly affect the existence of a cancer cell, the change of instructions can be passed on to daughter cells so that the cancer will no longer grow.  The epigenetic drug may not target the cancer cells directly by killing them, but instead, prevent further cancer growth by re-setting the instructions.  A sensitive period is a time when the genome may be most susceptible to eipgenetic changes and influences.  Sensitive periods of development include times of great cell division, such as in embryogenesis or in very young children.  We wouldn't want to give epigenetic drugs to pregnant women or young children because there is potential for great harm during these sensitive periods of massive, but normal, cell division. </p></div>
