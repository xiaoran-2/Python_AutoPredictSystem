    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span> <span>Decitabine, <span>epigenetic inhibitors</span>, is described in the article </span>“</span><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">Cancer’s epicentre</a><span>”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Decitabine is sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Decitabine is an epigenetic <span>inhibitor </span>drug and belongs to the  class of <span>DNA-demethylating agents.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect because <span>DNA methylation is one of many epigenetic mechanisms that cells use to control gene expression. <span>Tumor suppressor genes are often turned "off " in cancer cells because of hypermethylation, and Decitabine can turn them "on".</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>This change would be stable because e</span>pigenetic changes are inherited on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells  and finally all cells would have tumor suppressor genes turned "on".

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Because of the nature of passing genetic information through generations, altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. It is known that epigenetic changes are inherited on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells, so after many divisions of cells with altered DNA methylation sites finally all cells would have altered DNA methylations sites.</span></p>
<p>So called "sensitive period" is  the period in the cell development when changes in the environment have the biggest effect on the epigenetic marking of the organisms. The sensitive periods are the periods when the epigenome is actively reprogrammed which includes two stages -  removing all marks first and and restoring of epigenetic marks), so they include</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">1.Primordial germ cell development through mature eggs/sperm;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">2.P</span><span style="font-size:14px;">reimplantation and postimplantation periods.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Because women have eggs in "sleeping" mode, and men produce sperm cell during  life, treating male and female patients with drugs would have different effect. Treating patients when they are about to conseive a baby would inadvisable. Additionally, treating women who are going to have more babies in future possibly would be risky as well.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>1. The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG island is to keep free of methylation independent of their active state (whether "on" or "off").</span></p>
<p><span>2. Tumor suppressor genes are often turned "off " in cancer cells because of hypermethylation i<span>n cancer cells promoter at CpG islands. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Because tumor suppressor genes are silent This leads to uncontrollabe division of tumor cells.</span></span></p>
<p><span>4. Normal f<span>unction of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is t<span>o maintain genomic integrity. Normal function of DNA methylation at <span>repetitive elements</span> is t<span>o protect the genome from transposable elements</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>5. I<span>ntergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. This means that the undelying genes are repressed. <span> In healthy cells, there are CpG dinucleotides within coding and noncoding</span><span> intergenic regions, and because of methylation, parasitic repetitive sequences and oncodenes are </span><span>repressed.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>6. Because of demethylation in the CpG regions in Intergenic regions and repetitive elements, parasitic repetitive sequences and oncodenes are not silent anymore. This can lead to mitotic recombination and chromosome rearrangement<span> and then to failure of </span><span>the chromosomes separation properly during mitosis.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. <span style="font-size:14px;">The ICR at Igf2 and H19 is methylated on the </span><span style="font-size:14px;">paternal allele in normal state and unm</span><span style="font-size:14px;">ethylated on   the maternal allele. So, Igf2 is paternally expressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">2. Igf2 is expressed only on the paternal allele and not on the maternal allele.</span></p>
<p>3. Wilm's tumour is associated with overexpression of Igf2.</p>
<p>4. H19 is a growth restricting gene, so demethylation of H19 would promoted deseath, and overexpressing fo Igf2 would promote desease as well.</p></div>
