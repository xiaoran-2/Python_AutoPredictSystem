<p style="text-align:center;"> </p>
<p>           </p>
<p>The websource for common knowledge is Wikipedia: “In normal cells, CpG islands (CPI) preceding gene promoters are generally unmethylated, while other individual CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome tend to be methylated.  However in cancer cells CPI preceding tumor suppressor promoters are often hypermethylated, while CpG methylation (CPGme) of oncogene promoter regions and parasitic repeat sequences is often decreased”.</p>
<p>DNA methylation (DNAme) is found with CpG dinucleotides. It is laid down (by methyltransferase) at or near promoters (to silence; to maintain genomic stability). It is mitotically heritable (DNMT1 helps); is necessary for embryos to survive.   TET proteins effect removal of DNAme passively (at cell division) or actively (using enzymes). DNA demethylation is also mitotically heritable and acts in primordial germ cells (PGC), early development and during differentiation.</p>
<p>When disrupted (either genetically or epigenetically), DNAme can allow activation/overexpression of oncogenes; inactivation of tumor suppression genes through mutation/deletion. This can cause disease in tissues. Most studied are the many forms of cancer.</p>
<p>Cancer is when cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably; the cell’s normal transcription machinery is hijacked, disrupting normal epigenetically programmed DNAme function. To hypermethylate a CPI is to silence (stop or change) transcription and regulation of the cell cycle. Cancers need transcriptional silencing and tumor suppression to go on with disruption of normal function. Cancers can stop DNA methyltransferase and reduce DNAme by half.Normalcell function scrapes to a halt.</p>
<p>DNAme at repetitive elements (short or long noncoding nucleotide repeats) maintain genome integrity by stopping invading promoters, unplanned recombinations and transposable elements. At intergenic regions DNAme stops transcription of cryptic start/splice sites.</p>
<p> In cancer we see a lack of methylation with hypomethylation at repeats and intertgenic regions. This change in DNAme silences or activates what the cancer requires to live on.<br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-e7535ee17aab06cec01dbf30/970238/asst-5/970238-520958700f56d1.80284990.htm">Assessment Details Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression1.htm</a><br /> </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:center;">Disruption of Imprinting of the H19/Igf2 Cluster in Cancer</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> </p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> </p>
<p>Parent-of-origin dependent gene expression is mainly achieved by the DNA methylation pattern of the H19 and Igf2 genes.</p>
<p>In normal cells the paternal Igf2 and the maternal H19 genes are expressed. On the paternal allele, sites upstream of H19 are methylated; on the maternal allele these are not.</p>
<p>In tumors the maternal allele takes on the paternal allele’s methylated H19 promoter --<strong>&gt;</strong> Igf2 is silenced. H19 is turned off --<strong>&gt; </strong>increased cell growth occurs.</p>
<p>DNA methylation on imprinted genes is reset during gametogenesis and normally stays so for life. Change in methylation sacrifices growth restricting and tumor suppression genes.</p>
<p> When the maternal H19 promoter takes on the paternal pattern (+ methylation), Igf2 is activated and H19 silenced. This makes for the increased growth. Loss of tumor suppression insulation also lets disease fester. This is the root cause of Wilm’s tumor (and most cancerous growths).</p>
<p>In Wilm’s, maternal H19 goes from silent to active. An abnormally methylated DMR (upstream of H19)  and   Igf2 starts off the progression to cancer and Wilm’s tumor (childhood kidney cancer)..</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:center;">Decitabine to treat Cancer</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>            Decitabine is a DNA demethylating epigenetic acting agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (precursor to myelogenous leukemia) and solid tumors (it can penetrate these and may cause re-expression of tumor suppression genes).  </p>
<p>            This drug hypomethylates by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It inhibits EZH2 and stops methyl being added to histone proteins.  It is built into DNA strands and can act during sensitive periods for epigenetic reprogramming (gametogenesis, cell division, PGC, early embryo development, childhood). It may be contrain<br /><br />dicated for growing children and in pregnancy. Epigenetic changes can pass into at least the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation via cell division.  The effect of this is continuance of not killing cancer, but stopping the uncontrolled growth of these abnormal cells.</p>
<p>            This class of epigenetic drugs will make good results from “routine” chemotherapeusis, by making cancer cells more susceptible. Research is making even  new uses.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:center;">Epigenetic Drug Effects Keep Right on Going</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> </p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> </p>
<p>            S. Baylin thinks that azacitadine and a histone deacytylase inhibitor have been shown to slow lung cancer solid tumor growth. He also suspects that epigenetic drugs change tumor cells in a lasting way to make them more susceptible to ‘standard” chemotherapy.</p>
<p>            This might be due to the epigenetic changes that happen during cell division.  These do pass to the daughter and granddaughter cells. This effect lasts until the marks are actively erased, whence they do not return.</p>
<p>            These treatments cannot actually kill cancer, but do stop the uncontrolled growth.</p>
<p>            The effect of genome wide hypomethylation causes genome instability. Hypermethylation of tumor suppression genes is a hallmark of cancer.</p>
<p>            Sensitive periods are when epigenetic reprogramming is taking place. For example the 6 hours before fertilization are very sensitive for the paternal alleles. Oocytes are halted in prophase during gametogenesis and do not finish development until after the onset of puberty Egg maturation is again a very sensitive moment. PGC, early development, and at cell division are also times of epigenetic reprogramming (clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks, particularly DNA methylation). Early childhood and during pregnancy are times to be very careful using these drugs.<br /><br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-e7535ee17aab06cec01dbf30/970238/asst-5/970238-520a712e945127.15149047.htm">Assessment Details Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression 4.htm</a></p></div>
