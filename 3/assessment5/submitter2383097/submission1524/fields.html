    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. Generally,DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene.<br />In cancer, global genomic hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides in other parts of the genome leads to chromosome instability  and oncogene activation affects repetitive sequences, imprinted genes, tissue-specific genes, oncogenes, and genes associated with invasion and metastases, whereas many tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated and silenced. This is happen is due to mechanisms such as loss of imprinting and reactivation of transposable elements. <br />Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA. Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing.<br />Programmed changes in DNA methylation in intra-and intergenic regions are not restricted to differentiation-related events. Cancer cause rapid decreases and increases in DNA methylation in a substantial minority of CpG sites, especially at CpG-poor regions. The physiologically linked DNA demethylation included rapid demethylation of exons and introns in various positions of the genes. Importantly, the cancer-associated DNA hypomethylation in intronic and exonic sequences can modulate the amount and type of gene products and thereby contribute to tumor formation or progression. <br />Typically, cancer cells exhibit hypomethylation of intergenic regions that normally comprise the majority of a cell's methyl-cytosine content. Consequently, transposable elements may become active and contribute to the genomic instability observed in cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in DNA methylation in ICRs, both hypermethylation as hypomethylation can result in mistakes in cases of cancer in gene imprinting, causing overexpression of parental alleles or silencing of these, particularly those involved in growth. In normal cells, in the paternal allele the control region is methylated and then enhancers act on the Igf2 gene is only expressed because the f CFTC 4 will not bind to the methylated control region and the H19 gene is silenced. On the maternal allele, the control region is not methylated, and then element insulator, CTFC 4 binds to the control region and enhancers act on the H19 gene and it is expressed, the IgF2 gene is silenced in the maternal allele. In cancer cells imprinting is lost and develops the Wilm's tumor, in this case, the maternal allele has also methylated in control region and has no expression of H19 but as in the IGF2 paternal allele, then there is a double dose of IGF2 compared with normal cells leading to the development of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitabine is a member of a new class of drugs known as DNA "demethylating" agents and it a hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Methylation of DNA is a mechanism that regulates gene expression in cells. When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth.  When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. The Decitabine regulated molecular points related to incorporation into DNA, including  DNA hypomethylation, and induction of the DNA damage. Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold.   One way that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.<br />The periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development. Imprinted genes are especially sensitive to environmental signals. Because imprinted genes have only a single active copy and no back-up, any epigenetic changes or "epimutations" will have a greater impact on gene expression.<br />The Imprinting happens during egg and sperm formation, when epigenetic tags are added to silence specific genes and DNA methylation reprogramming during the early embryonic period. <br />The treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because diet, hormones, drugs and toxins can all affect this process, impacting the expression of genes in the next generation.</p></div>
