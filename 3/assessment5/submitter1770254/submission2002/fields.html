    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation altered in cancer is characterized by a decrease in global methylation and an increase in CpG-island methylation.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, there is often hypo-methylation at CpG islands (not methylated) and hyper-methylation at the intergenic regions. In cancer, CpG islands are hyper-methylated. CpG islands are often found at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, which is why CpG islands contributes to the growth of cancer.</p>
<p>Normal cells have hyper-methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In cancer cells, those areas are hypo-methylated. These areas are important for genomic stability; hypomethylation of these repeats leads to genetic instability including deletions, reciprocal translocations, and insertions. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal methylation pattern of the H19/Igf2 cluster is as follows: the paternal allele has methylation at the H19 area, which leads to expression of the nearby Igf2 gene and the maternal allele lacks methylation at H19, leading to expression of H19 rather than Igf2.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, the expression is changed in that the maternal allele is also methylated at H19. This leads to overexpression of Igf2 as it is expressed via both the maternal and paternal alleles. This methylation change can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of two epigenetic drugs on the market. Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases. This drug, in particular, is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (predecessor to leukaemia).</p>
<p>Because the drug demethylizes, cancerous cells that are hypermethylated at CpG islands would be induced to be hypomethylated. These CpG islands are often found in the promoters of genes affecting cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation. By inducing hypomethlyation, the drug is able to stop pre-cancerous cells from rapidly growing and dividing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have lasting effects because epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, meaning that daughter cells will also contain these induced epigenetic changes. This also means that one must be more careful not to administer the drugs during sensitive periods when the cells would be going through epigenetic reprogramming. During these time periods, the epigenome is most sensitive to change and modification. The sensitive periods of development are gametogenesis and early preimplantation. Treating during this time is not recommended because it would have lasting affects to an individual’s epigenome. Since many drugs work by inducing hypomethylation, it may affect the intergenic regions, which are normally hypermethylated. This could lead to mis-expression of genes. </p></div>
