    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are regions od DNA with high  C+G content and high frequency of CpG dinucleotides. The cytosines in CpG dinucleotides can be methylated to form 5-methylcytosine. DNA methyltransferases are enzymes that add a methyl group to cytosines  (DNAMT3a and DNAMT3b are essencial for <em>de novo</em> methylation). The methylation it is mitotically heritable, due to DNAMT1. </p>
<p>In mammals the genes with high levels of 5-methylcytosine in their promoter region are silenced. Some areas of the genome are highly methylated and these areas tend to be less transcriptionally active. CpGs are clustered into CpG islands, often at promoters of genes. Then the CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation. </p>
<p>The Intergenic regions and  repetitive elements are usually methylated. DNA methylation lead to genes silencing by two mechanisms: (1) formation of a repressive chromatin structure through CpG binding proteins such as MeCP1 and MeCP 2 (they have a DNA binding domain and they can repress transcription from methylated gene promoters); (2) blocking rare transcription factors binding and alter gene expression.</p>
<p>The methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements maintain the genomic integrity. The methylation of repeats has a silencing effect of transposons, prevents transcriptional interference and illegitimate recombination. Besides methilation is mutagenic, so prevents also the transposition.</p>
<p>In somatic cells, patterns of DNA methylation are in general transmitted to daughter cells with a high fidelity (through mitosis). Aberrant DNA methylation patterns can cause cancer, through two distinct forms: (1) CpG Island hypermethylation, that repress transcription of tumour suppressor genes, via promoter region; (2) DNA hypomethylation of repetitive regions, CpG poor promoters and loss of imprinting by ICRs. The repeats and intergenic hypomethylation leads to genomic instability, such as illegitimate recombination between repeats, transposition  and activation of promoters, namely of oncogenes, triggering uncontrolled cell division.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The  Igf2/H19 cluster is located at human chromosome 11. The Igf2 encodes a peptide hormone that regulates cellular proliferation and differentiation. The H19 is transcribed to non-coding RNA. A nearby region of DNA up-streams of the H19 transcription start site is called <em>imprint control region</em> (ICR). This region controls the genomic imprinting of both H19 and  IGF2 genes. ICR corresponds to CpG-islands that differ in degree of methylation of the alleles; the paternal is methylated but not the maternal. Therefore the maternal transcribes H19 but not the paternal.</p>
<p>CTCF is an insulator, binding on the maternal ICR, that blocks the enhancer and then silences the maternal Igf2. The paternal methylation of ICR prevents CTCF binding. IGF2 and H19 genes are imprinted, with expression of the paternal IGF2 and maternal H19 alleles.</p>
<p>The imprinted domain is linked to the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), which is characterized by overgrowth phenotypes of affected children as well as a predisposition to develop embryonic tumors such as Wilms tumor. The aberrant methylation of maternal ICR blocks the insulator binding and leads to loss of imprinting, resulting in overexpression of lgf2 causing the tumorigenesis, particularly in Wilms tumour. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation silences the gene expression. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity leads to DNA methylation through the addition of a methyl group to the 5′ carbon position of cytosine bases. The DNA hypermethilation causes down-regulation of tumor suppressor genes. The methylation of the promoter turns off tumor suppressor genes and triggers cancer. The gene silencing by DNA hypermethylation can be reversed by D<span>NA methylation inhibitors. </span>Decitabine is a DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor (DNMTi).  As DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, decitabine causes DNA methylation decreasing (hypomethylation in CpG islands) and re-expression of tumor supressor genes. Therefore decibatine blocks tumor's growth and causes cancer cell apoptosis. Thereby normal patterns can be restored, such as cell differentiation, proliferation and tumor supressed. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenome is dynamic and responds to environmental signals during development and throughout life. Chemicals can cause changes in gene expression that persist long after exposure has ended. Drugs may alter human epigenome. Some drugs affect chromatin architecture or DNA methylation.</p>
<p>The pattern of DNA methylation is heritable, both through mitosis and from one generation to the next. The period when methylation program for development is reset and epigenetic marks actively remodelled is named sensitive period.</p>
<p>The epigenetic reprogramming consists of clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks in two sensitive periodes, when there is a strong decline in DNA methylation: (1) early embryonic development and (2) primordial germ cell (PGC) development. </p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods  with drugs afects DNA methylation in the germ line, and during early embryogenesis (pregnant women). Therefore abnormalities in DNA methylation caused by drugs can produce defects in subsquent generations. Some drug efects are  teratogenic during embryogenesis and might have potential carcinogenic effects. Therefore treating patients with drugs during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.</p></div>
