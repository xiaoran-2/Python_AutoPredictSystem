    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, more methylation of CpG islands results in increased condensation of DNA, which tends to silence promoters and prevent transposition of repeated elements. CpG islands in active promoters are usually unmethylated, and CpG islands in intergenic and repeated elements are generally methylated.</p>
<p>Cancer cells tend to be hypomethylated, especially at intergenic regions or repetitive elements, but at some CpG islands, there is an increase in methylation.</p>
<p>Tumor suppressor genes are often hypermethylated in cancer cells, silencing expression of these critical growth regulation genes.</p>
<p>Different CpG islands seem to be hypermethylated in different types of tumors, so different tumor suppressor genes seem to be silenced in different types of tumors. For example, in retinoblastoma, the <em>RB</em> gene is mutated or silenced, while in some breast cancers, the gene <em>BRCA1</em> is mutated or silenced. Hypermethylation can extend up to 2 kb from these islands.</p>
<p>If CpG islands are hypomethylated, there is a chance that methylated cytosine could deaminate to thymine, causing a mutation. In addition, expression of genes from intergenic or repeated sequences that are normally silenced by DNA methylation could lead to an increased rate of recombination at those sites, leading to mutations elsewhere in the genome. Hypomethylation of specific CpG-poor promoters might lead to activation of oncogenes such as R-Ras in gastric tumors or miR21 in glioma.</p>
<p>Also, if CpG islands in tumor suppressors are specifically methylated (silenced), this could act to prevent expression of these suppressor genes, which could increase the amount of unregulated cell division. Since DNA methylation is mitotically inherited, this change can be passed along to daughter cells within a tumor.</p>
<p>In normal cells, DNA methylation in intergenic regions or repetitive elements acts to silence promoters found in those elements, and reduce the level of transposition or recombination of those elements.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf 2 is a growth factor, so the regulation of Igf 2 expression is important in the control of cell growth. The paternal allele of the H19 /Igf 2 control region is methylated, so CTCF does not bind the insulator region, allowing enhancers to increase expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>The maternal allele of the H19 /Igf 2 control region is un-methylated, so CTCR binds to the insulator region, allowing for transcription of H19 instead of Igf 2.</p>
<p>In Wilms’ tumor, both alleles are methylated at the H19 /Igf 2 control region, so CTCF does not bind the insulator region on either allele, allowing enhancers to express Igf2 at high levels.</p>
<p>By increasing the levels of expression of the growth factor Igf2, kidney cells are at high risk of neoplasia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleotide analog that in low doses, inhibits the action of DNA methyltransferases such as DNMT1, leading to hypomethylation of DNA.</p>
<p>By inhibiting DNMT1, decitabine reduces the amount of DNA methylation in cells and prevents the inheritance of DNA methylation marks in daughter cells.</p>
<p>Many tumor suppressor genes are improperly hypermethylated in a variety of cancers. Decitabine may allow those tumor suppressor genes to be de-methylated, so that they can be expressed. This could stop the growth of certain tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. DNA methylation can be passed along to daughter strands of DNA during DNA replication by ‘maintenance’ DNA methyltransferases like DNMT1. Drugs such as Decitabine that inhibit DNMT1 would definitely reduce the methylation of daughter DNA strands during replication. If these epigenetic marks are not added to new DNA strands after replication,  epigenetic regulation by DNA methylation will be ‘diluted’ with each cell division.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of development where epigenetic marks are sensitive to environmental signals. In human development, sensitive periods include the period between fertilization and implantation of the blastocyst as well as the period of primordial germ cell development in the fetus. At these times, many of the epigenetic marks are removed, but then appropriate methylation is re-established as cell differentiation continues.</p>
<p> If cancer patients are treated with drugs that effect DNA methylation or demethylation during the sensitive period where germ cell DNA is demethylated, or during the period where epigenetic marks are re-established, then appropriate patterns of methylation might not be established and normal epigenetic gene control may be lost.</p>
