    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the most important features in epigenetics, which is the reason for normal methylation to be essential in the correct performance of grow cell. Normally, CpG islands are free of methylation, which means the gene is being expressed. However, in cancer, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, which can be the reason to silence genes related to tumour suppression, like apoptosis or DNA repair. This disruption of DNA methylation of CpG islands causes genomic instability and deregulation of tissue. On the contrary, in normal cells, genes, introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. This methylation in intergenic regions helps to maintain genomic integrity. When there is genomic instability due to abnormal DNA methylation, a cell can be presenting deletions, insertions, translocations and duplications. The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements also helps to maintain genomic integrity, specifically since DNA methylation is mutagenic (because amine group of 5-methyl cytosine can be lost and this will convert it into a thymine, so it will be more frequent to find more TG dinucleotides.) it could prevent transposition, random recombination and transcriptional interference. When DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer, mutations can occur, so genomic integrity can be compromised.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, and although Imprint Control Regions have different modes of action, loss of DNA methylation is common. To understand this mechanism, it is important to remember that each gene in an imprinted cluster is controlled by a shared imprinted control region, for example, in H19/Igf2 cluster. Normally, on the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, and it is methylated on the paternal allele, that is why it is paternally imprinted. This maternal pattern allows the transcription of a long noncoding RNA: H19 (the unmethylated ICR is bound by an insulator protein (CTCF), protecting CTCF’s binding insulate Igf2 from enhancers, which act on H19). Since there is methylation on the paternal allele, CTCF is not able to bind to the ICR, so enhancers can activate the expression of Igf2. Disruption to Igf2 (caused by mutations which cause loss of imprinting) promotes growth, since it is an oncogene, and this can be the cause of Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the most important goals in fight against cancer is developing drugs able to activate tumour-suppressor genes or inhibit the silencing of these same genes (among others mechanisms). Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes; being a nucleoside analogue, decitabine binds irreversible to DNMT. However, the mechanism is not well known, and it is unclear how bad can affect normal cells, especially in long term.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methylation is mitotically inherited, any alteration can have enduring effects on the epigenome. Administration of drugs that alter DNA methylation must be avoided, especially when the epigenome is vulnerable to environmental insults, e.g during periods of extensive epigenetic reprogramming. These periods are called sensitive periods, because the environment could affect remodeling of epigenetic marks, like early embryonic development or puberty in female germ cells. After this, is reasonable to think that treating patients during sensitive periods could be counterproductive, because these drugs can cause alterations in epigenetic marks, like DNA methylation or histone acetylation in random genome regions.  </p></div>
