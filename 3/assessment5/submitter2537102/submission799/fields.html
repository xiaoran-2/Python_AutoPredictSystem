    <div class="field-value"><p>Usually in a cancerogenic tissue there is a global decrease of methylation and an increase of Cpg islands methylation. In a normal cell we usually have unmethylated CpG islands and methylated intergenic regions, repetitive elements and introns; in cancer we have the complementary. Cpg islands are found where the promoters of tumor suppressors are so that, being usually unmethylated, these suppressors are active in normal cells. When these tumor suppressor promoters are methylated they are epigenetically silenced so that tumors are facilitated to develop. Of course this is only one of the factors that can cause a tumor. This is a very efficient way to silence a promoter because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable; but this epimutation is even reversible (differently from DNA mutations) and this opens chances to therapies to remove hypermethylation. Furthermore, given that the CpG islands methylation progresses as tumor progresses,  we can get some good markers for prognosis and diagnosis.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually, in normal cells, methylated. This to avoid genome instabilities, that is genes deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. These instabilities are also avoided thanks to densely packaged chromosomes in the heterochromatin. Practically every kind of cancer we have hypomethylations genome-wide of these elements and this happens quite early with the tumorigenesis and progresses with time.For example when the repeats are activated by the hypomethylation (this is actually the most frequent case of hypomethylation) they can copy themselves and jump around the genome causing transpositions, disrupting of genes and activations of genes by means of promoters where they jump to. Hypomethylation can occur (seldom)  in other regions like imprint control regions and the poor promoters regions: in these last, hypomethylation is associated with activation of genes that can result in promoting tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the cancer cells common feature is that they don't show any imprint specific parent of origin expression: this means that they show this expression in both or none of the parental alleles. This usually happens very early before the real tumor genesis. Depending on the particular control region we are taking into consideration we can find both hypermethylation or hypomethylation. In the case in consideration the imprint control region is unmethylated for the maternal allele and methylated for the paternal allele (in normal cells). In the maternal allele the enhancers will act on H19 and Igf2 will be silent; in the paternal allele enhancers will act on Igf2 because of methylation of imprint control region and Igf2 is so expressed by the paternal allele. When the imprinting is lost (hypermethylation in this case) then we have methylated imprint control region on the maternal allele resulting in expression of Igf2 in this allele as well. We have in this case a double dose of the Igf2 with respect to a normal cell and, given that Igf2 is growth promoting, this results in the Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of enzymatic epigenetic regulators: they lay down or remove or deal with chromatin remodelling. In particular Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It reduces DNA methylation so decreasing the silencing effect of methylation in tumor suppressor genes. This inhibitor gets incorporated into the DNA so that when the DNA methyltransferase binds the daughter strand of DNA to insert a methylic group, it binds irreversibly the inhibitor as well so that the methyltransferase cannot be released. This actions is clearly dependent of the replication of cells: the effect is so amplified in tumor cells because they are replicating at a faster rate. Experimentally has been found that at high doses these inhibitors are toxic and to have an antitumoral effect they must be used at much lower doses.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modifications are mitotically heritable; this means that they are passed on during cell divisions apart during formation of primordial germ cells and gametes. Once some epigenetic markers have been set up, they last during following cellular divisions until they are naturally or artificially reset. This also means that epigenetic changes are reversible and drugs exacly try to reset epigenetic abnormalities promoting cancer. There are anyway some periods when artificial epigenetic changes must be avoided: these are the sensitive periods that is the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development. In general sensitive periods are those when epigenetic reprogramming occurs; for example early development, peri-conceptual period, pregnancy, embryogenesis, gametogenesis. If a treatment was given during these periods, it could end up in disruption of normal setting / resetting of epigenetic markers leading to problems and diseases in future generations. </p></div>
