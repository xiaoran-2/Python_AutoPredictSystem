    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state.</p>
<p>However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene</p>
<p>DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes. Tumour suppressor hypermethylation causes that the oncogenes could be expressed. Hypermethylation is more frequent than mutations, and the Identity of hypermethylated CGIs varies by tumour type.</p>
<p>Also in cancer Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA.</p>
<p>It has been speculated that this methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is translated into an enhacement of  genomic instability that may be traduced for example in the  repression of  transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing.</p>
<p>The contribution of of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements to cancer includes for example Illegitimate recombination between repeats, the activation of repeats and transposition and the activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 is a gene for a long noncoding RNA, The H19 gene sequence also contains binding sites for the C/EBP family of transcription factors. One of these C/EBP transcription factor binding sites also contains a CpG site. In vitro methylation of this CpG site on a DNA construct strongly inhibited transcription of the H19 gene. Mice with a loss of H19 function express an overgrowth phenotype similar to babies with BWS. This has led researchers to suggest that perhaps the only function of H19 RNA expression is to regulate the expression of IGF2 (Insulin Growth Factor 2).</p>
<p>In paternal allele, H19 gene is methylated, repressing the transcription of H19 enabling the expression of igf2 gene from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In maternal allele, H19 gene is not methylated, and it is expressed. Its expression induces the action of two enhancers that provoke the expression of CTCF protein that blocks the Igf2 gene in the maternal allele.</p>
<p>The mutations in maternal Kcnq1 cluster, causes the expression of maternal Igf2 gene, causing the loss of imprinting, increasing the levels of igf2</p>
<p>Over expression of IGF2 can be responsible for overgrowth, and generally, IGF2 is expressed in the absence of H19.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decetabine is a drug commercialized by Eisai, under the brand name of Dacogen.. It is used to treat myelodiysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It is a DNA demethylating agent.</p>
<p>Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis.</p>
<p>Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in the DNA methylation pattern could produce changes in the gene expression profile of an organism. For example it has been shown that changes in the concentration of DNA methylation in certain loci of the genome, were related with the inhibition of tumor suppressors or activation or oncogenes.</p>
<p>The methylation patters could change during the life of a certain organism. Sensitive period is a stage in the early development of an organism in which a reprogramming of the epigenetic marks happened.</p>
<p>There are a number of key periods for epigenetic influence. The first occurs during preconception, because this is when the sex cells of the next generation are forming. The second is during fetal development. This is when there is rapid stem cell differentiation and in females, the development of the egg cells. The third occurs before and during puberty –most importantly in males as this is when the sperm cells mature.</p>
<p>Any interferences of a drug during these periods may affect the correct epigenetic code, producing random phenomena of activation or inactivation of genes.</p></div>
