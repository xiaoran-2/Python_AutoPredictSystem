    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of the CpG island in the promotor region of a gene leads to the silencing of the gene. Normal cells are generally hypomethylated at CpG islands in the promotor region thus enabeling transcription of the gene (CpG island methylation is however involved in important functions such as X-inactivation). Cancer cells often show locus specific hypermehylation of CpG island (and their shores) in the promotor region of certain genes. These genes can be tumor suppressor genes (e.g. RB in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer). The silencing of these tumor suppressor genes by CpG island hypermethylation (perhaps as a second hit (loss of function mutations are generally recessive - Knudson's hypothesis) can lead to the uncontrolled growth that characterize cancer as their normal regulation af cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair etc. is lost. In contrast one can see hyomethylation of CpG in CpG poor promotors in oncogenes leading to their activation.</p>
<p>Methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements plays an important role in normal cells. In contrast to CpG islands these are generally methylated. Important functions of methylation of intergenic regions are the maintenance of genomic stability and the silencing of cryptic splice sites. Methylation of repetitive elements has several important functions including silencing to prevent transposition and transcriptional interference from strong promoters. They protect the genome and againts aberrant gene expression. Cancer cells generally show genome wide hypomethylation especially of the intergenic regions and repeats. In accordance with its normal function this leads to genome instability and altered expression of neighbouring genes. The effect on genomic instability can explain some of the many genomic changes seens in cancer (deletions, insertion, translocations). The genomic instability causes tumor progression by disrubting tumor suppressor genes and activating oncogenes. The hypomethylation can directly activate oncogenes by activating cryptic splice sites.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting by both hypermethylation og hypomethylation can contribute to cancer. because the gene are now silenced og expressed on both the maternal and paternal allele. Imprinted genes are often involved in growth. This will be described using the hypermethylation of the ICR in the H19/Ifg2 cluster that is involvede in Wilm's tumor. This cluster contains an ICR, which can bind an insulator CTCF if unmethylated, a sequence coding for Igf2, a sequence coding for the long noncoding RNA H19 and an enhancer.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and it cannot bind the insulator. This enables the enhancer to drive the expression of igf2. H19 is not expressed due to heterochromatin spreading. In contrast the ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele. Thís enables the insulator to bind and block the expression of igf2 driven by the enchancer. The imprinted methylation of the pateranal ICR thus means that igf2 only is expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>The methylation of the maternal allele in Wilm's tumor thus enables expression of igf2 on both the maternal and paternal allele. The result is that the level of gene product is to high. This could contribute to cancer as the gene product is a growth factor (insuline growth factor 2).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Most drugs that target the epigenetic machinery is enzyme inhibitors Decitabine belongs to a certain class of thes inhibtors known as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi).</p>
<p>As the name implies Decitabine works by blocking the effect of methyltransferases that works on DNA. It is a nucleosid analouge that is incorporated into the DNA during replication. The DMT is then inhibited irreversibly when trying to methylate the incorporated analouge. By blocking the methyltransferases the drug reduces DNA methylation.</p>
<p>As described above som malignancies are depent on locus specific hypermethylation and the effect on tumors could be dependent on removing this hypermethylation. This could explain the good effect on heamatological malignancies. It is however possible that the effect is unspecific and hits all dividing cells as classical chemotherapeutics. The replication dependency of Decitabine means that fastly dividing cells such as cancer cells are most severly affected. Finally there could be some yet unknown effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are often mitotically heritable (this is sometimes included in the definition of an epigentic alteration), i.e. persists through cells divions. This is the case for DNA methylation. DNA methylation is laid down by methyltransferases. The transferase DNMT1 acts on hemimethylated DNA as it is found after replication and methylates the unmethylated strand at corresponding sites. DNA methylation is thus mantained and altering methylation will have enduring effect on the epigenome.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods are mainly the periods of epigenetic reprogramming, where the epigenetic marks are removed and layed down again. These are during primordial germ cell development and during early embryonic development. Besides there can be organ specific sensitive periods.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods are more likely to affect their offspring because the epigenetic marks are removed and reestablished dependent on the enzymes that the drugs are inhibiting. Fortunately most cancer affect elderly people, which limits this problem.</p></div>
