    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>The function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is almost universally to silence genes since CGIs are often at the promoters of genes.  In normal cells, CGIs tend to be protected from methylation.</p>
<p>Conversely, one of the hallmarks of cancer cells is methylation of CpG islands and the island shores, notably at the promoters of tumour suppressor genes.  Indeed, tumour suppressor hypermethylation is often even more frequent than mutations, perhaps at least in part because they are mitotically heritable.  Since DNA methylation at CGIs is almost exclusively associated with gene silencing, it follows that with tumour suppressor genes off, the growth of cancer cells is promoted. </p>
<p>Which CGIs are hypermethylated varies with tumour type. Although normal aging is also associated with increased CGI methylation, cancer cells typically exhibit more than usual methylation of CGIs and the level of methylation rises, the more cancer cells proliferate into surrounding tissue.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically methylated in normal, healthy cells, but tend to be hypomethylated in cancer cells.  The effects of this aberration vary depending on where it occurs; effects include deletions, insertions, duplications, translocations, and illegitimate recombinations of repeats which can lead to activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes.  Indeed, since the function of intergenic regions and repetitive elements appears to be to maintain genomic stability, this is precisely what is lost when these areas are not sufficiently silenced (or "protected" as Professor Timothy Bestor's hypothesis would have it) through methylation.  </p>
<p>Broadly speaking, if the key hallmarks of an epigenetically healthy cell are methylated CpG islands and unmethylated repetitive elements and intergenic controls, then very often the reverse configuration of epigenetic marks is found in cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer since imprinted genes are very often involved in growth promotion or growth suppression.  Hyper- and hypomethylation are common early events of cancer and can often be seen in pre-neoplasmic tissue.</span></p>
<p><span>In the H19/Igf2 cluster of healthy cells, the paternal allele is methylated and the maternal allele is not.  On the maternal allele, the ICR is bound by the protein CTCF, which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers.  Blocked from binding to Igf2 by CTCF, the enhancers' second preference is to bind to H19 and to enhance its expression.  This process is called chromatin looping.</span></p>
<p><span>On the paternal allele, in contrast, CTFT cannot bind and the enhancers are free to activate Igf2, leading to its expression.  H19 is not active because of heterochromatin spreading from the DNA methylation site to the promoter of this gene.</span></p>
<p><span>In cancer, as well as paternal methylation, there can also be hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele (where Igf2 should be silenced), resulting in the overexpression of the gene Igf2 and the silencing of H19.  The overexpression of Igf2 is the aberration seen in Wilm's tumour, since Igf2 is a growth promoter (being a paternally imprinted gene).</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to the DNMT inhibitor class of epigenetic drugs.</span></p>
<p><span>It works by irreversibly binding to DNA methyltransferases after they are incorporated into DNA, preventing them from performing their function of methylating DNA upon cell replication.  This intervention targets cancer cells since these are replicating more often, so will lose their mitotically heritable DNA methylation more quickly than healthy, more slowly replicating cells.</span></p>
<p><span>Decitabine has an anti-tumour effect because it reduces the amount of methylation overall in the genome.  Since cancer cells typically exhibit DNA hypermethylation particularly of tumour suppressor genes (which leads to excessive growth and tumours), decreasing the level of methylation has been shown to be very effective in reducing tumour size and treating AML.  This efficacy comes, despite the fact that the treatment lacks specificity and probably hits all dividing cells to some extent.  What's more, its long term effects are as yet unknown.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methyl groups are laid down on DNA in a de novo fashion by DNMT3a an DNMT3b during development.  Each cell maintains its methylation through the work of DNMT1, another DNA methyltransferase enzyme, which recognises hemimethylated DNA and lays down methylation on the daughter strand upon cell replication thereby restoring a fully methylated CpG dinucleotide.  Owing to its mitotic heritability, DNA methylation is thus regarded as a stable epigenetic mark which has enduring effects on the epigenome.</p>
<p>There are certain sensitive periods when the epigenome is particularly susceptible to change and manipulation, the most critical of these undoubtedly being the two waves of epigenetic reprogramming during early embryonic development (pre-implantation and early post-implantation) and during primordial- and germ cell development through to the production of mature sperm/egg cells.</p>
<p>Human epidemiological studies, such as the Oeverkalix study on diet, have demonstrated that the sensitive period post-natally for diet to epigentically affect germ cell maturation is from the age of 9-12 in boys and 8-10 in girls.</p>
<p>It is inadvisable to treat pre-pubescent patients suffering from an illness such as cancer with such epigenome-modifying drugs during these sensitive periods since above all the potentially adverse effects this may have on their developing germ cells.</p></div>
