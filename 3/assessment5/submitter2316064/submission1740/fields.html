    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation refers to the attachment of a methyl group to the C5 position of C bases in DNA. This naturally occurs at C's followed by G's (termed CpG) so that methylation can be present at the same location on the other strand (as C is opposite to G and vice versa), although can occur at other positions as well (abeit rarely).</p>
<p>CpG islands are clusters of CpG dinucleotides and are often found at promoter regions. These regions are normally usually not methylated - when they are, the following gene is silenced (eg. in the inactive X chromosome in male mammals). In cancer CpG islands at promoters tend to be hypermethylated. In the case of imprinted genes, the hypermethylation of CpG rich imprint control regions (ICRs) causes the loss of imprinting and as imprinted genes are often associated with growth, this promotes tumor progression. Furthermore, the silencing of promoters of tumor suppressor genes further promote cancer development.</p>
<p>In contrast, in a healthy cell intergenic regions and repetitive elements are heavily methylated. This is to maintain genomic stability as inactivation via methylation helps to repress transposition, cryptic promoters and illegitimate recombination. In cancer these regions are consistently hypomethylated (as is the whole genome in general). This promotes genomic instability - the changing of the karyotype through deletions, insertions and translocations of regions of chromosomes. This also contributes to the loss of imprinting in genes with IRCs that lack CpG islands.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of an imprinted region. Here normally the paternal ICR (imprint control region) is methylated. When this happens, the CTCF protein cannot bind to the DNA, the DNA remains flexible and the enhancers downstream of the ICR can bind to the Igf2 gene upstream of the ICR. This way Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. Normally on the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated and the CTCF protein can bind the DNA. This results in a loss of DNA flexibility which prevents the downstream enhancers from binding to the upstream Igf2 gene. Instead the enhancers bind to the downstream H19 gene and promote its transcription.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele is behaving like the paternal allele due to a genetic mutation or uniparental disomy (or due to epigenetic misregulation, but this is very rare). Hence the Igf2 gene is expressed from both alleles (and hence with double dosage) which leads to increased growth that is associated with childhood kidney tumors (Wilm's tumor). In cancer this aberrant expression can be induced epigenetically with the abnormal methylation of the maternal allele.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (an FDA approved drug) is a DNMTi drug, meaning that it inhibits DNA methyl-trasnferases (DNMTs). It does so by being a nuceoside analogue: it is incorporated into the DNA (the cell has to replicate in order for this to work) and then binds to DNMTs. This binding is irreversible and by this decitabine effectively decreases the levels of active DNMT enzymes. This naturally decreases DNA methylation, and although the exact mechanism of action is still unclear, this seems to be effective in the treatment of some haematological malignancies. One reasonable mechanism through which this can be achieved is that the decreased methylation of CpG islands of promoters can re-activate tumor suppressor genes which are deactivated in these cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in somatic cells is a very stable mark. This means that it is not only maintained during the lifetime of the cell but DNA methylation patterns are passed on to the daughter cells as well. This ensures that the daughter cells share the same expression patterns necessary for the stability of the differentiation of the lineage. This way if DNA methylation is altered, this alteration can be passed on to all subsequent generations of cells until the DNA methylation pattern is actively modified.</p>
<p>Such active DNA methylation pattern modifications can be seen during sensitive periods. The two most pronounced such periods are when epigenetic reprogramming occurs: during early development and primordial germ cell development. In both cases, the majority of the existing DNA marks are erased and reset. This heavy alteration of epigenetic marks is sensitive to the environment (hence the name), as is shown by the increased occurrence of certain diseases in individuals that were concieved with ART (assisted reproductive technologies). Although disease incidence rates remain low in these individuals, this shows that any procedure altering epigenetic marks can have a serious and (yet) unpredictable outcome if administered during these sensitive periods.</p></div>
