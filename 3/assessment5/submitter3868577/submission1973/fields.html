    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in the promoters of TS genes. In a normal cell CpG islands are hypomethylated which allow TS gene to function normally, to suppress the aberrant overgrowth of a cell.</p>
<p>Through the progressive hypermethylation of CpG islands over time the TS genes are silenced, so the suppressor effect is removed and the cell can divide more rapidly and not die so fast.</p>
<p>For a cancer to develop is necessary to exist multiple genetic and/or epigenetic modification, as having 2 alleles of TS genes silenced plus other gene alterations or activations.</p>
<p>The hypermethylation of CpG islands can be measured/detected as single biomarkers (in tumor tissue or blood as cell-free tumor DNA or tumor cells)  or as panels of biomarkers – for hypermethylated  CpG islands of a set of genes - and used clinically as diagnostic (i.e.<em>GSTP1 hypermethylation in prostate cancer</em>) and prognostic tools (i.e. <em>miR-34b/c hypermethylation is associated with metastasis</em>), to monitor clearance from treatment and recurrence or to identify specific feature of the cancer. Also the presence of some hypermethylated genes can give us useful information about treatment efficacy, as MGMT hypermethylation suggest that treatment with temozolomide is not therapeutic because MGMT protein is required to process the alkylated agent into active form.</p>
<p>In a normal cell DNA hypermethylation of intergenic and repetitive element maintain genomic stability. In cancer cells hypomethylation of integenic and repetitive elements means less dense packed chromathin and as a consequence genomic instability allows different genomic modifications like illegal recombination, activation of repeats and transposition, deletions, insertions.</p>
<p>The role of DNA methylation is context dependent because tumors have different dependencies (driven by tumor suppressor hypermethylation or by chromatin instability) and can be stage specific with important implications in effectiveness of epigenetic therapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The unmethylated ICR on <strong>maternal</strong> allele allows binding of CTCF (insulator protein) that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers by restricting enhancer access to Igf2. As a second preference the enhancers act on <em>H19 increasing its expression</em>.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at ICR on <strong>paternal </strong>allele blocks binding of CTCF, so the downstream enhancers will act on <em>Igf2 and activate</em> it.</p>
<p>H19 is no longer active on paternal allele because of DNA methylation spreading from ICR downstream to H19 promoter (methylation of CpG islands) and therefore H19 is silenced.</p>
<p>Wilms tumor is an imprinting disease. H19 is a tumor suppressor gene and Igf2 is an oncogene that promotes growth.</p>
<p>Disruption of the methylation pattern in maternal allele can lead to silencing of H19 tumor suppressor gene and activation of Igf2 oncogene.</p>
<p>Bipaternal epigenotype with selective loss of maternal and reduplication of paternal chromosome 11 alleles in Wilms' tumors points to the existence of a paternally imprinted tumor suppressor genes and/or a maternally imprinted growth-promoting genes in this chromosomal region, with H19 inactive and Igf2 biallelically active.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Regulation of the genes by methyl or acethyl groups attached to the DNA or to the proteins that support the DNA, opened a field of research and interest in finding new ways of cancer treatment.</p>
<p>The epigenetic anticancer drug Decitabine is an DNA-demethylating agent that it is used in the treatment of myelodysplasic syndromes, which can often evolve in acute myelogenous leukemia. Decitabine is responsible of these epigenetic changes, specifically demethylation of histone that surrounds the genes involved in cancer.</p>
<p>EZH2 is an enzyme whose normal role is to attach methyl groups to histone proteins. Mutations makes the EZH2 enzyme overactive which in turn leads to overmethylation of histones and as a result the genes surrounded  by histones are silenced, including the tumor suppressor gene that normally stop the uncontrolled cell growth responsible for cancer.</p>
<p>So demethylation of overmethylated histones and activating back the tumor suppressor gene and other genes, makes Decitabine an effective drug in the treatment of myelodysplasic syndromes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr. Baylin speculates that combined epigenetic treatment is having a delayed effect or is even sensitizing patients tumors in way that make them more vulnerable to subsequent therapies.</p>
<p>A recent study using combination therapy for solid tumors, with low doses of decitabine and azacitidine , showed decreased DNA methylation and reactivation of genes that can affect tumor growth and cell death.</p>
<p>Researchers observed that tumor growth was substantially inhibited in mice that received treated cells with combination therapy, implying that the demethylating drugs had produced a “memory” antitumor response. This is possible because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division (mitotic heritability) to daughters cells until they are actively erased and do not return.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods are the period of primordial germ cells development all the way through the production of mature eggs and sperm cells and the period of preimplantation and early post implantation which are periods of active remodeling of epigenome associated with genomic instability. Epigenetic modification by the drugs acting in that periods can alter gene expression, normal functioning of the cells and long term development.</p>
<p>Also epigenetic changes can be passed on to later genera­tions, affecting the health of their descendents and epigenetic changes to genes in egg or sperm cells can be inherited by future generation.</p></div>
