    <div class="field-value"><p>In <strong>normal</strong> cells, CpG islands, which are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, are <strong>hypomethylated</strong> so that these genes can be expressed, leading to the control in cell divisions. In <strong>cancer</strong> cells, <strong>hypermethylated</strong> CGIs silent tumor suppressor genes by locking in acyl in the active site. DNA methylation needs to be combined with other mechanisms to be sufficient to generate tumor regenesis, ensures cancer cells not to die due to epigenetically abnormalities but rather to keep growing. Moreover, DNA methylation, associated with gene silencing, is mitotically inheritable so that once the mutant cells divide, their hypermethylated marks maintain, these cells are more likely to proliferate and then occupy the space, forming tumor. CpG poor promoters are promoters with insufficient CpGs ( therefore not considered CGIs) are hypomethylated in cancer cells. Those are associated with activating oncogenes (<em>R-RAS</em>) or transcription of miRNA targetting tumor supressor genes (<em>miR21</em>), generally, indirectly lead to cancer.  </p>
<p>Most of the genome is made up from intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In normal cells, these are DNA methylated, i.e. silenced. In cancer cells, these regions are often found hypomethylated, leading to the genomic instability. One way of instabilities is the reciprocal translocation when the repetitive is not heavily methylated, identical sequence in the repetitive elements misalign and probably exchange (recombinate). Another way is that hypomethylation actives the transposons, leading to the transcriptional abberations in the surrounding regions.</p>
<p>Some types of tumors are driven by hypermethylated tumor suppressor genes which help cells divides rapidly. Other types are hypomethylated repetitive elements which enhance genomic instabiliy. More complex, the mechanism of tumor development can change during its lifetime. Therefore, affect of DNA methylation on cancer is context dependent (types of cancers, times, mechanisms...).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA demethylation agents.</p>
<p>Its chemical structure is similiar to 5-azacytidine. They are analogues of nucleosides but have addional modifications. Decitabine binds covalently to the serine residue at the active site of DNMT1, irreverseably inactivates DNMT1, leading to hypomethylation in the genome.</p>
<p>DNMT1 maintains DNA methylation marks of the genome passively when cells replicate, therefore decitabine takes effect dependently on cell replicates. In tumor cells, the replicative rate is much higher so that the effect is greater. When cells divide rapidly along with the accumulation of loss of DNA methylated marks, they may ends up in genomic instability then probably die. The fact that decitabine works most effectively in the case of myelodysplastic syndrome infers its prevention of hypermethylated CGIs, which are usually promoters of tumor suppressor genes so that tumor cells are suppresed. There are also possibly different mechanisms that have not been stated yet. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-dbdc2d8b2b75a8df6fb5ce3e/970238/asst-5/970238-52064af3761749.21982991.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>From the left of the Figure. <strong><em>Igf2</em> cluster in normal cells</strong>: <em>Igf2</em>, Imprinting control (ICR), <em>H19,</em> Enhancers.</p>
<p>In <strong>maternal</strong> allele, ICR is not methylated so that it can bind to CTCF, an insulate protein. CTCF protects enhancers from forming loop with <em>Igf2</em> then <strong>silents <em>Igf2</em></strong>. Instead, enhancers binds to <em>H19</em> and activate it, whose role in this case is not considered.</p>
<p>In contrast, in <strong>paternal</strong> allele,  ICR is methylated so that it cannot bind to CTCF. There are no insulators for <em>Igf2</em>, therefore it can form loop with enhancers and is <strong>expressed</strong>.  </p>
<p><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-dbdc2d8b2b75a8df6fb5ce3e/970238/asst-5/970238-52073c1c96c2d4.03531518.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>From the left of the Figure.<strong> <em>Igf2</em> cluster in Wilm's tumour cells</strong>: <em>Igf2</em>, ICR, <em>H19</em>, Enhancers</p>
<p>In both maternal and paternal alleles, ICRs are methylated so they cannot bind to CTCF. As the result, enhancers form loops with Igf2 and activate Igf2. Igf2 therefore is <strong>overexpressed</strong> comparing to normal cells, leading to Wilm's tumour.</p>
<p>Igf2 which is growth promoting gene has double dose, causes the cell divides rapidly and uncontrolably results in Wilm's tumour. Loss of imprinting is one of mechanisms leading to tumour, when both maternal and paternal alleles are etheir expressed or silenced. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at specific gene is typical among cells in different tissues and maintained through cell replication. Although altering DNA methylation is reversible, the effect may last during the cell's life, which make its progeny lose the first DNA methylation marks, leading to the aberrance of gene expression of that cell types. The accumulation of losing DNA methylation mark is sufficient to cell's malfunction. This reversibility is also used to treat cancer.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is when genome is vunerable i.e. easily changes (gain/ lose) its imprinting marks. There are two typical sensitive periods, early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development, when the epigenetic reprogramming is set up.  </p>
<p>Young patients who have developing germ cells should be awared when taking epigenetic drugs. Epigenetic drug acts on the mechanism of altering DNA methylation in cancer cells, effect of which may last severely and interfere with other normal cells. If normal cells affected is primordial germ cells, its consequence will remain to the patient's children or grandchildren. Therefore, during sensitive periods, it is inadvisable to use epigenetic drug on patients. Although the main purpose of treating is to prolong lifetime, we should also consider next generation to be healthy and safe.</p></div>
