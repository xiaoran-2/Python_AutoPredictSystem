    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, DNA methylation at CpG islands helps in epigenetic control of gene expression. It serves to silence genes whose expression is not required by preventing the binding of transcription factors or chromatin remodelling complexes. It plays a role in X inactivation, imprinting, and embryonic development.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands are usually hypermethylated and act to silence tumour suppressor genes, especially when the CGI is located in the promoter of the gene (eg . RB gene in retinoblastoma). This silencing gives the cell a growth advantage leading to the tumour growth and can be considered an alternative or supplement to genetic mutation (second hit in Knudson two-hit hypothesis). This DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and allows the cell to be rapidly selected for, which contributes to cancer cells' fast progression and survival. CGI hypermethylation increases over time and therefore contributes to the increased disease state.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, methylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions serves to prevent genomic instability by keeping repetitive elements locked in an inactive state preventing their transposition and illegitimate insertion into neighbouring regions.This means that the ultimate role is in normal embryonic development and regulation of gene expresiion.</p>
<p>There is DNA hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer. This leads to genomic instability by activation of repetitive elements, allowing them to transpose into other gene regions and disrupt their expression by disrupting the coding frame and also causing cryptic promoter activation (eg. Axin fused gene). In addition, illlegitimate recombinations between repeats and ensuing reciprocal translocations can occur. All of these lead to either deletions, insertions or translocations that lead to the cancer .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. When the ICR is unmethylated (as on the maternal allele), CTCF can bind and insulate Igf2 and therefore the enhancers  act on the H19 gene, but there is no Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In contrast, when the ICR is methylated ( as on the paternal allele), CTCF cannot bind to insulate Igf2. Therefore, the enhancers act on Igf2 instead of on H19 and Igf2 is expressed. </p>
<p>In WIlm's tumor , there is hypermethylation of ICR on the maternal allele as well. This , by the same mechanism as on the paternal allele, leads to the expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele as well. Thus, there is double the expression of Igf2 and no expression of H19- a loss of imprinting.</p>
<p>Igf2 is a growth factor and therefore there is excess growth factor in the cancer cell leading to its quick cell growth and survival, and contributes to the disease development.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogue that gets incorporated into the DNA during replication. Once in DNA, it irreversibly binds DNMT that tries to replicate the methylation pattern into the daughter strand.  This binding  prevents any further activity of the DNMT. Decitabine therefore reduces the methylation of DNA and has a demethylation effect. This mechanism of action is therefore replication dependent, meaning that cancer cells (which are more rapidly dividing than normal cells) will be affected to a larger extent.</p>
<p>Decitabine is effective in myelodysplastic syndromes (which are dependent on the hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoters of tumour suppresor genes). Therefore, the inhibtion of DNMT by Decitabine in these patients  leads to reduced methylation of the previously hypermethylated CGIs and consequent gene activation This means that the tumor suppressor genes are now able to be expressed, and exert their anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation changes are heritable epigenetic changes that can be transmitted during cell division.  Therefore, their effects can endure over time and from one generation to the next (until they are erased).  Since these are long-term changes, the effects can last past the period of drug treatment which is why they might possibly make the targeted cells more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p>
<p>A sensitive period of development is one where significant epigenetic reprogramming occurs (methylation marks are laid down and/or erased)</p>
<p>There are two major sensitive periods of development:  the period during early development (from fertilization till blastocyst formation), and the period during germ cell development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during these sensitive periods is inadvisable because it may disrupt the epigenetic reprogramming process. The presence of chemicals that affect methylation and other epigenetic processes can influence the epigenetic reprogramming in an unknown (possibly detrimental) manner. It might lead to loss of epigenetic marks that function in normal cell development or gain of other undesirable (possibly tumorigenic) marks, which would cause the treatments effects to be nullified. Imprinted genes which need to be accurately epigenetically reprogrammed may not be properly imprinted in the early development stage or there may be a loss of DNA methylation marks during primordial germ cell development, all of which can have adverse effects.</p></div>
