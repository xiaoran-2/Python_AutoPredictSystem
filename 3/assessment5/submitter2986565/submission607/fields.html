    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism of transcriptional control. DNA methylation at the 5 position of cytosine has the specific effect of reducing gene expression and has been found in every <a title="Vertebrate" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate">vertebrate</a> examined. In adult somatic cells (cells in the body, not used for reproduction), DNA methylation typically occurs in a <a title="CpG site" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site">CpG</a> dinucleotide context. DNA methylation is probably the most well researched epigenetic mark that differs between normal cells and tumor cells in humans. The "normal" CpG methylation profile is often inverted in cells that become tumorigenic. In normal cells, CpG Islands preceding gene promoters are generally unmethylated, while other individual CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome tend to be methylated. However, in cancer cells, CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters are often hypermethylated, while CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions and parasitic repeat sequences is often decreased. In many disease processes, such as cancer, gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. <span> The hypermethylated intragenic regions were highly enriched for localization to exons and intron-exon boundaries, suggesting a possible role in regulation of alternative transcriptional start sites, exon usage and/or splicing; instead </span>human repetitive elements (REs) make up more than half of the human genome and contain approximately 52% of all CpG dinucleotides in the human genome<span>. </span>In adult cells, human REs are generally highly methylated and this status is associated with maintenance of chromosome structure and genome integrity. What happens in the case of cancer is that these intergenic intervals and their repetitive elements now tend to be unmethylated, and this means that as whole in the genome, you tend to see hypomethylation. This is believed to result in chromosomal instability and increased mutation event.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It could be possible that epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. The sensitive periods are the periods when the epigenome is actively remodeled (i.e., removal and reestablishment of epigenetic marks) and include: primordial germ cell development through mature eggs/sperm; preimplantation and postimplantation periods. These are the periods, that they seem to be most sensitive to changes in the environment. However it's important to remember that treating patient, especially young patient, during sensitive period could be inadvisable because it could be used a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinting control region (ICR) at IGF2 and H19 is normally methylated on the paternal allele. Methylation is excluded from the maternal allele by CTCF binding. The presence of CTCF confers an insulator function upon the ICR, which blocks access of the IGF2 promoters to the enhancers downstream of the H19 gene. This function is lost on the methylated paternal chromosome and this enables IGF2 expression by allowing the promoters to access the enhancers. In maternal allele only H19 is expressed while IGF2 is silenced. In a majority of Wilms' tumors (WTs) there is an abnormal bipaternal pattern of expression at three imprinted loci, H19, IGF2 and KIP2, clustered on chromosome 11p15.5. This happened because in these Wilms tumors the transcriptionally silent maternal IGF2 allele is activated such that IGF2 expression occurs biallelicall. Thus, DNA methylation appears to be essential to maintain the normal pattern of imprinting at the IGF2/H19, locus</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agents. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands. <span>Decitabine produces its anticancer effects by causing a chemical reaction that damages the DNA in a cell. The DNA damage caused by decitabine inhibits protein synthesis and results in cellular death.</span> It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia .                                      </p>
