    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are regions in eukaryotic promotors that have at least 60 % C or G as bases. That does not happen so often in other regions because there they can be easily methylated and then be more easily replaced. In the promotor region, in contrast, this region is not so much methylated (hypomethylated) if the gene is active, because methylation in this region prevents the gene to be transcripted.The methylation in whole progresses with age.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, CpG island are methylated more likely   (hypermethylation) which inactivates tumor suppressor genes which are important for correction and therefore normal function. This is one reason for developing cancer (one of several necessary "hits" occuring to DNA according to a hypothesis of Knudson for the development of degenerated cells). The methylation pattern is different in different tumor types.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repitititve elements are methylated at some points in healthy cells, here in contrast to the CpG islands, the methylation decreases in cancer cells.</p>
<p>Then there is the possibility of hypomethylation which occurs at CpG islands (CpG poor promotors) and is a possibility of oncogene activation.</p>
<p>So in result, there are two main possibilties:</p>
<p>1. Hypermethylation of CpG islands: results in downregulation of tumor suppressor genes</p>
<p>2. Hypomethylation of CpG islands: results in upregulation/activation of oncogenes</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic lymphoma syndromes, a precursor of  myelogenia leukemia. It is a DNA demethylating agent which means it can remove methylation of DNA. Because some tumors are due to epigenetic changes rather than "real" mutations of the DNA  which can also result in silencing of tumor supressor genes, this way of too much methylation of DNA in the promotor region should be solved  removing the methylation which this drug tries to. The result of this drug, the demethylation of the promotor region, should be, that the tumor repressor gene is transcribed again so that the tumor can be "repressed" again.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When methylation is changed by the drug, this result stays even if the medication is stopped. More enduring effects are caused by the mitotic inheritability of the epigenomic pattern.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is the period, when methylation of DNA is taken away and a new setting is started. This is two times in humans for example, while developping the new germline and after embryonic implantation.</p>
<p>Treating patients in this period would mean too much chaos because the body is busy with setting new marks, and imprinting is set new f. ex. and therefore these factors could be changed and therefore disturbed using  a demethylation medication, too.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19 and the Igf2 gene are reciprocally imprinted.</p>
<p>Igf2 is activated on the paternal chromosome  and H19 is activated on the maternal chromosome by enhancers.</p>
<p>These enhancers consist of first a differentially methylated region (dmr) upstream of H19, which functions in a dual way, and secondly, a set of tissue specific enhancers downstream of H19. These enhancers act specifically in activation of igf2(paternally) and H19(maternally).</p>
<p>CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream promotors, meaning that the enhancers then can act on H19, activating it (chromatinloop).</p>
<p>On paternal allel, if CTCF cannot bind (It is paternally imprinted, preferred), and the enhancers can activate Igf2. </p>
<p>The methylation of CTCF can spread into the H19 promotor, synonymous with gene silencing.</p>
<p>Beckwith Wiedemann is an illness that results from loss of Cdkn1c or upregulation of Igf2. This illness results in a predisposition of embryonic/childhood tumors, but not adult tumors, for which Wilms tumor is an example.</p>
