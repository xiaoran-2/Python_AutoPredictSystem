    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>Usually, CpG islands lack DNA methylation to allow active gene expression. In contrast, tumour cells have CpG islands that have methylated cytosines (at CpG sites), and the methylation of CpG islands is increased with tumour progression. CpG island methylation contributes to the formation of repressive chromatin structure and may inhibit transcription factor binding. This in turn, can lead to the silencing of downstream tumour suppressor genes (e.g. RB in retinoblastoma; BRCA1 in breast cancer) which is required for abnormal cellular growth of tumour cells. </p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA is normally methylated to silence cryptic promoters and splice-sites, and transposons. In cancer, the methylation at these sites is gradually decreasing with the progression of tumour. This may activate cryptic promoters and splice sites which disrupts normal transcription because aberrant transcripts will be produced and some genes may be activated. In repetitive elements, transposons may be activated which can lead to genomic instability through different mechanisms (illegitimate recombination during mitosis, transposon transposition etc.). Genomic instability is a hallmark of many cancers because it may lead to abnormal cell division due to many different mechanisms (e.g. the formation of transcripts which encode for oncogenes).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are often growth-regulators. A common feature of cancers is the loss of imprinting which results in uncontrolled growth. This can be due to decreased levels of growth-restricting proteins or elevated levels of growth-promoters.</p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is imprinted. The imprint control region (ICR) of paternal allele is methylated but maternal unmethylated. The latter is bound by a protein named CTCF which acts as a blocker to downstream enhancers and therefore the Igf2 protein is not produced. On the paternal allele, CTCF is not able to bind the methylated ICR. Thus, the enhancers act on Igf2 gene to allow it's expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the ICR is methylated on both paternal and maternal chromosomes. Consequently, CTCF does not bind to ICRs of H19/Igf2 and Igf2 is expressed from both alleles. This means that Igf2 is expressed in abnormally high levels. Because Igf2 is growth-promoting, the signal to proliferate in the cells is in excess and this contributes to tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agent. It's structure is similar to cytosine and it can be incorporated into DNA instead of cytosine. </p>
<p>Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase because it binds the enzyme irreversibly. The bound DNA methyltransferase can not carry out it's mission and this leads to DNA hypomethylation. Therefore, tumours which are dependent on tumour suppressor gene promoter DNA hypermethylation (e.g. some hematopoietic tumours) can be cured with this chemical agent.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The "enduring effects" arise from mitotic heritability of DNA methylation state - in somatic cells, the methylation state of the parent cell is usually not altered and is inherited by daughter cells. If DNA methylation is changed with therapeutics in the parent cell, then the daughter cells will also show the altered state.</p>
<p>The epigenetically sensitive periods are periods of active epigenetic reprogramming. These occur in primordial germ cell development and in the early stages of embryo development. Therefore, if young patients and pregnant women recieve therapeutics that alter their epigenetic state, the epigenetic state of their offspring might also be altered and this might have devastating consequences.</p></div>
