    <div class="field-value"><ul><li> CpGs are clustered into CpG islands, often at gene promoters(where transcription factors bind). They are usually kept free of methylation independent of whether they are expressed or silent. So DNA methylation at CpGs lead to silencing of gene expression.Methylated CpG is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure. Methylated CpG binding proteins like MeCP1&amp;2 can bind and also recruit other factors that <strong>condense the chromatin</strong>, hence leading to<strong> gene silencing</strong>.</li>
<li>In cancer, there is<strong> hypermethylation of CpG islands</strong> and CpG island shores of tumour suppresor genes. Imprinting Control Region (ICR) are also hypermethylated.</li>
<li>Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands lead to<strong> silencing of genes</strong> such as<strong> tumour suppressor genes</strong>. It can serve as an alternative to gene mutations and one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis.Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable it is passed on to subsequent cells. These epimutations are then selected and allowed to proliferate.</li>
<li>DNA methylation in<strong> intergenic regions</strong> help in <strong>maintaining genomic stability</strong> by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. It has been noted that DNMT1 null cells display genomic instability. In repetitive elements, DNA methylation causes silencing and mutation of repeats to<strong> prevent transposition</strong>.It also<strong> represses transcriptional noise</strong> from strong promoters and <strong>prevents illegitimate recombination</strong>.</li>
<li>In cancer, there is a <strong>genome wide lack of methylation</strong> in intergenic regions and repetitive elements and<strong> genomic instability</strong>.It occurs to some extent in aa tumour types tested.</li>
<li>Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions lead to the chromatin being<strong> less condensed</strong> (euchromatin) and therefore vulnerable to illegitimate recombination beteen repeats, activation of repeats and tansposition. It also causes activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.All this leads to<strong> genomic instability</strong>.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The insulator model of imprinting is employed by the H19/Igf2 imprinted locus.On the<strong> paternal</strong> chromosome,<strong> ICR is methylated</strong>. This<strong> prevents CTCF</strong> binding, allowing the enhancers to act on Igf2 and therefore<strong> expressing Igf2</strong>. The DNA methylation at the ICR spreads to H19 promoter and <strong>silences H19  </strong>expression.</li>
<li>On the maternal chromosome,<strong> ICR is not methylated</strong>. So the<strong> CTCF insulator protein can bind</strong> and prevents the enhancers on the H19 side from accessing the Igf2 gene.The enhancers allow <strong>expression of H19</strong> but<strong> block Igf2 expression</strong>.</li>
<li>In Wilm's tumour, there is<strong> hypermethylation of ICRs</strong>, i.e., the ICR in the maternal allele also is methylated  as a result of which there is no CTCF binding and there is<strong> Igf2 overexpression</strong>.There is loss of imprinting.</li>
<li>Upregulation of Igf2 which is a growth promoting oncogene and the loss of Cdkn1c which is a tumour supressor leads to predisposition to embryonic or childhood tumours. e.g. Wilm's tumour in the kidney.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors called the DNMT inhibitors.</li>
<li>Decitabine causes DNA demethylation by inhibiting DNMT.</li>
<li>It is a nucleoside analogue and therefore binds DNMT irreversibly after they are incorporated into the DNA.They are dependent on replication and act on cells which have a high rate of replication.Since cancer are actively dividing , they serve as a good target.</li>
</ul><p> </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Epigenetic drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome as DNA methylation is a stable epigentic mark and are passed on during cell division to daughter cells and susequent cell lines until they are actively erased during reprogramming phases.</li>
<li>A sensitive period is one in which active erasure of epigenetic marks and epigenetic reprogramming takes place .</li>
<li>Primordial germ cell development and early development (pre-implantation). </li>
<li>Treating patients during the sensitive periods is not advisable as the germ cells can be affected and disruption of epigenetic reprogramming can have terrible consequences.In the case of a woman  with a pre implantation embryo , the long term effects have to be considered.</li>
