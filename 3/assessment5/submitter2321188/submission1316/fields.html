    <div class="field-value"><p>Generally, in normal cell CPG islands [found in the promoter regions] are tending to be hypomethylated which is important for the expression of suppressor genes that control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. In contrary, in cancer cell the CPG islands are usually tend to be hypermethylated, as a result, the cancer cell get an over advantage to silence the tumor suppressor genes which helps out the cells to skip the cell cycle regulatory mechanisms eventually to grow and reproduce uncontrollably, leading to cancer. Furthermore, the disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease occurrence analogous to DNA mutations, for example, hypermethylation of CpG islands of a single gene like RB, MLH1 are known to cause retinoblastoma and colorectal cancer, respectively, this can also occurs in sets of genes such in case of MDS and lung cancer. In general, CpG islands DNA hypermethylation are frequent in cancer this is because DNA-methylation is mitotically heritable and epimutated cells are rapidly selected than the normal cell. Likewise, in cancer cells the repetitive elements, intergenic region and intron genes are more commonly become hypomethylated, where in normal cells these regions are hpermethylated to silence expression of the junk genes and so maintain genomic stability. Hence, in cancer cells when these regions of the gnomes become hypomethylated it results in genomic instability which is a critical feature of cancer cells and one of the known reasons for the development and aggressiveness of may type of cancers. Thus, the disruption of DNA methylation in these regions cause chromosomal translocation, deletion and insertion to the normal coding gnome which is known to favor the generation of mutants that can be selected by the microenvironment of the cells which in turn contributes to the development of cancer and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cell if we see the imprinting gene H19/Igf2 cluster, ICR of the paternal allele is methylated because of this CTCF insulators are not able to bind the ICR which opens a way for the enhancer protein to act on Igf2 gene and so expressed from this paternal allele. Whereas, Igf2 gene is silenced from the maternal allele in normal cells this is because ICR is unmethylated and the CTCF insulator are able to bind ICR as a result the enhancer protein are prevented to act on Igf2 gene, instead act on H19. However, in Wilm’s tumour  this imprinting H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted, meaning the Igf2 gene is expressed both from paternal and the maternal allele  this is because in Wilm’s tumour ICR of maternal allele is hypermethylated and so CTCF insulator is not able to bind the ICR as a result Igf2 gene will be expressed from both alleles. Thus, because Igf2 is a growth promoting gene and expressed in twofold in cancer cells, such as in Wilm’s tumour, compared to the normal cells, the cells will have an overgrowth advantage which in turn contributes to disease occurrence.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is nucleoside analogous epigenetic inhibitor that belongs to DNA-methyltransferase inhibiter [DNMTi] and its impact on DNA methylation is during replication of the DNA. Meaning, when the cell make a DNA replication to go through cell division the decitabine will incorporates to the replicating DNA, consequently, the DNMT enzyme will come and binds the daughter DNA strand to lay down the methyl group. However, in this case the binding of DNMT enzyme to decitabine is irreversible because of this the DNMT enzyme will no longer easily available to lay down the methyl group to the daughter DNA strands especially for the rapidly replicating cells than the slow one. Therefore, decitabine has anti-tumor effect because cancer cells make a more rapid cell divisions and DNA replication than normal cells and cancer cells suffer more as decitabine makes DNMT enzyme not easily available for the subsequent daughter cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A drugs that alter DNA methylation can have an effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment this because epigenetic change are mitotical heritable. Means, if a drug that targets epigenetic marks had been used for a certain period of time to treat tumor this may not only affect the cells that are found during the course of the treatment but also to the daughter and granddaughter cells after the treatment had been stopped as epigenetic changes are passed over to the subsequent generation during division of cells. However, when and how the drug administered to patients need careful consideration especially during the two very sensitive period of development (pre-implantation early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development) where remodeling of epigenetic marks occurs, such as DNA Methylation. This is because the treatment may result in a large environmental insult in the patient body which in turn can affect all type of cells found throughout body, <span>most importantly </span>the cells epigenetic marks. For this reason, use of drugs during these very sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming, particularly during germ cell development of the younger patients, is not advisable since epigenetic marks are very sensitive for environmental change.  </p></div>
