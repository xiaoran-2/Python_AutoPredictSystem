    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of CpG dinucleuotides is adding of a methyl group to cytosine group. Clusters of CpGs at promoters are called CPG islands. A promoter is where the transcription of DNA starts. CpG islands are protected from methylation. However, DNA methylation at CpG islands means silencing of gene expression.</p>
<p>DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer when the CpG islands promoting the expression of <em>tumour suppressing genes</em> are hypermethylated. As a result, there occurs silencing of tumour suppressing genes resulting in formation of tumours which lead to cancer.</p>
<p>While CpG islands are usually unmethylated, the intergenics regions and repetitive elements in DNA are usually methylated. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic stability,i.e., to prevent deletions, insertions, translocations, repetition, etc.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer when those of oncogenes are unmethylated when they are supposed to be methylated. Unmethylation of these regions of oncogenes results in repetition of expression causing indefinite cell growth leading to cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the ICR (imprinted control region) is methylated and spreads to methylating the H19 promoter too. Hence, the enhancers can access Igf2 to activate Igf2, i.e., Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated. Being unmethylated, CTCF (an insulator protein) binds to ICR and insulates Igf2 from the enhancers. Hence, in the maternal allele, Igf2 is silenced while it is expressed in the paternal allele.</p>
<p>This imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster in paternal and maternal alleles is disrupted either due to hypo or hyper methylation. This alternation can lead to silencing of growth restriting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of ICR results in overexpression of Igf2 causing Wilm's tumour. Hypermethylation of ICR means that the ICR is methylated in both paternal and maternal alleles thereby blocking CTCF and resulting in overexpression of Igf2 (growth promoting gene) from both alleles. This leads to Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents class of epigenetic inhibitors.</p>
<p>Decitabine has a positive effect in treating cancer because it works by demethylating the methylated CpG islands in cancer cells.</p>
<p>Methylation of CpG islands results in silencing of gene expression. Hence, by demethylating the methylated CpG islands which are promoters for tumour suppressing genes, these tumour suppresing genes are expressed successfully therefore having an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes in DNA are mitotically inheritable, i.e., passed on to daughter cells and to grand-daughter cells and so on unless they are removed. Epigenetic drugs remove the cancer-causing epigentic changes and since once these changes are removed they don't re-appear, epigenetic drugs have enduring effects.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark of the DNA. As explained above how these are mitotically inheritable, altering DNA methylation which is also an epigenetic mark thus has enduring effect on the epigenome.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is a period of development where the epigenome can be affected due to alterations in the environment.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods of development are the pre-implantation or early development period and the primordial germ cell development period.</p>
<p>Treating cancer patients during sensitive periods is not advised because in these periods the DNA or epigenome is unmethylated and the epigentic marks are resetted in the following somatic maintenance period. So treatment during sensitive period is merely a waste.</p></div>
