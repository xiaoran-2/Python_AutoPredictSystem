    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally DNA methylation at CpG islands is connected to silencing of gene expression. This can be achieved through two mechanisms. First mechanism is bounding of methylated CpG by methylated CpG binding proteins, which can recruit other factors that condense chromatin. Second is prohibiting transcription factors to bind DNA because of extra methyl group. In cancer we can find hypermethylation of promoters of tumor suppressor genes which are responsible for controlling growth and invasiveness of tumor cells. If imprint control region are hypermethylated it can lead to overexpression of growth factors (example Igf2 in Wilm’s tumor) or loss of expression of growth restriction genes which are one of characteristic which enables growth and progression of tumor. Intergenic and repetitive elements in genome are usually methylated with aim to stabilize genomic integrity. Intergenic region is methylated to silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. Repetitive elements are methylated to silence or mutate repeats to prevent transposition, to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and also illegitimate recombination. In cancer we find this regions hypomethylated. This leads to genomic instability which shows in the shape of deletions, insertions, translocations. This can lead to loss of function of tumor suppressor genes (growth restrictions) or activation of oncogenes (growth promotors, metastasis).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Paternal allele is methylated imprinted control region which prevents binding of CTCF protein to ICR. This allows spreading of methylation to H19 promoter, what enable downstream enhancers to activate Igf2 expression (upstream). Maternal allele is not methylated at ICR, so protein CTCF can bind. This insulates Igf2 from enhancers so it’s not expressed. On the other hand we have expression of H19 gene. In Wilm’s tumor also maternal ICR is methylated so instead of expression of H19, we get expression of Igf2. And this is one of the driving factors of disease because we get overexpression of growth factor. One of hallmarks of cancer is sustaining proliferative signaling. Double dose of growth factor promotes overgrowth of effected cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug with DNA-demethylation activity used for treating symptoms of myelodysplastic syndrome. Its function is to inhibit DNA methyltransferase activity. With inhibiting DNA-methyltransferase you inhibit maintenance of DNA methylation and consequently you get less methylated DNA trough cell divisions. With this is possible to get hypomethylated CpG islands in promoter and you can restore expression of tumor suppressor genes which enables control over cell cycle – growth and division of cells- which is lost in cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is important epigenetic mark. DNA methylathion of CpG islands of promoter repress expression of protein. DNA methylation is also mark used for gene imprinting (ICR) where methylation is not necessary connected with gene silencing; it can also activate it/them. Methylation of histones tails can influence expression in both ways – repression or activating it - it depends on the position of mark which causes more tightly or loosely condensed chromatin. So altering DNA methylation can cause imprinting disorders, embryo lethality, tumorgenesis, blocks in differentiation and infertility. Sensitive period is period when altered environment have an effect on epigenetic control. At that point it comes to epigenetic reprogramming. It is during preimplatation period of embryo development and also during development of primordial germ cells. Treating during sensitive period can influence next generations because during this time germ cells develop and define future of child who will get this set of chromosomes. During embryo development it also comes to reprogramming. If you don't have active methyltransferase, you cannot establish genomic imprint which can cause serious problems during life of child or even abortus.</p></div>
