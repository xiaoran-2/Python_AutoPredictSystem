    <h1>Submission 1955 from Anon (session_user_id: d93a2ac988f068b6308b2b50e7a54fe40e919fa3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Methylation at CpG islands cause X chromosome inactivation and silencing of genes.</li>
<li>CpG islands are hypermethylated in cancer.</li>
<li>Tumor repressors can be silenced.</li>
<li>Methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements increase genomic stability by silencing transcription start sites (prevents RNA polymerases on opposite strands from interfering with transcription), splice sites, and repeats (prevents transposition and illegitimate recombination). </li>
<li>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancer.</li>
<li>Hypomethylation causes genomic instabity, such as illegitimate recombination, transposition, activation of repeats, and activation of promoters which can cause disruption to nearby genes. Genes expressed at abnormal levels lead to disease. An overexpression of growth factors can lead to tumor proliferation.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The ICR is methylated on the paternal allele. Without CTCF, methylation spreads to H19 and silences, allowing <span>Igf2 </span>to be accessed.</li>
<li>The ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele and is bound by CTCF. CTCF insulates <span>Igf2</span> from downstream enhancers, which instead bind to H19.</li>
<li>Both chromosomes appear to be paternally imprinted, which can result from mutations that cause loss of imprinting, aquisition of two copies of a chromosome from on parent, or epigenetic loss of imprinting.</li>
<li>Cdkn1c, a tumor repressor and growth repressor, on the maternal chromosome is no longer expressed, while <span>Igf2, an oncogene and growth promoter, on the paternal chromosome and now the maternal chromosome is overexpressed. This leads to fetal overgrowth and predisposition to childhood tumors.</span></li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA-methylating.</li>
<li>Increases/restores methylation.</li>
<li>It could methylate oncogenes and growth promoting genes, which would prevent and slow tumors.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Methylation is mitotically heritable, meaning that subsequent cells in the same lineage would retain the changes in epigenetics.</li>
<li>When epigenetic marks are cleared and reset.</li>
<li>Early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development.</li>
<li>Sensitive periods are a time when cells are doing reprogramming of their own, so drugs that alter methylation could lead to incorrect epigenetic marks for the cell line and dysfunction.</li>
</ul></div>
