    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is broadly disrupted in cancer, causing genomic instability and the silencingof many tuumor suppressor genes as well as the activation of oncogenes. The CpG islands, along with their shore regions are particularly affected. In normal chromatin, CpG islands and shore regions are usually unmethylated, unlike other CG rich regions and repeats.  In cancer this hypermethylation causes the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, while there is a concomittant demethylation of the DNA overall that greatly increases genomic instability. DNA methylation is normally used to controll gene expression, with methylation of promoters and intergenic regions inversly correlated with gene expression.  CpG islands are largely unmethylated in the normal cells, and are often associated with tumor supressor genes and DNA repair genes that keep healthy cells free of the errors that can cause oncogenesis.  In cancer these changes disrupt normal transcription, favoring the transformation of the cell to a pluripotent state nd disrupting important mechanisms of apoptosis and DNA repaair tat give the cell an advantage over the surrounding tissue, and allow for tumor growth and metastasis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>The disruption of imprinting can have several adverse effects on cells, unregulating tightly controllled intracellular balances, and supressing expression of tumor suppressor protiens.  For the Igf2 allele, the paternal allele is normally methylated on the H19 promoter, allowing transcription of Igf2, wheras the maternal allele is unmethylated, allowing H19 to be expressed, while suppressing Igf2 expression.  In Wilms tumor, the H19 promoter and the CTFC binding site are methylated equally in both alleles allowing an overexpression of Igf2 from both paternal and maternal alleles.  The overexpression of the Igf2 gene by supression of the H19 lncRNA creates increased growth and oncogenesis in Wilm's tumor patients</strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decetabine is a member of the DNA demethylating agents, a class of drugs that removes methyl groups from nuclear DNA. While the article does not specifically describe how it accomplishes this, there is certainly a concentration effect, which allows Decitabine to preferentially demethylate areas where there is a higher concentration of DNA methylation present.  In cancer these would be the CpG islands and shores, that are critical to the transcription of tumor suppressing agents and DNA repair enzymes, thus allowing the cell to fight back against the cancer internally.  The general hypomethylation seen in other regions such as intergenic regions and repeats would mean that there would be an overall increase of the expression of the tumor suppressors without a further deterioration of genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are several possible mechanisms whereby drugs that target DNA methylation could make cancer cells more susceptible to standard chemotherapeutic treatment even after cessation of these drugs.  Since epigenetic marks are mitoticaly heritable, changes to the mother cells during treatment are passed on to the daughter cells, creating a population of tumor cells with these changes incorporated.  Demethylation of CpG islands and shore regions would activate tumor supressors that could act in concert with standard chemotherapeutic drugs to allow for cell death and DNA repair, and thus allow for greater efficacy of the latter.  Sensitive periods are periods of extensive epigenetic remodelling, such as in the pre implantation embryo, or during gametogenesis, but also later in develoment for specific areas still undergoing specialization post natally.  Sumministration of DNA demethylizing agents during this period could permanently and adversely effect future development of all of these cells, including germ cells, leading to devastating consequences unrelated to the tumor itself.</p></div>
