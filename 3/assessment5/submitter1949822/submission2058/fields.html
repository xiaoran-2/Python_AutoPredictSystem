    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often located around promoters; at these locations, the GC sequence is not methylated; most of the methylation occurs at CpG island shores. Methylation of CpG sites in the promoter of a gene may inhibit gene expression; the CG sequences in inactive genes are usually methylated to suppress their expression.</p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation at lCRs: hypomethylation and hypermethylation.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation and Hypermethylation are linked to loss of imprinting; can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>CpG island hypermethylation and DNA hypomethylation contribute to cancer progression</p>
<p>Aberrant DNA methylations give as a result the repression of transcription in tumor suppressor genes as hypermethylation of CpG islands; CpG island hypermethylation is associated with gene silencing in cancer.  CGI methylation progresses with time; DNA methylation alterations increases with age.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation impacts chromosomal and transcriptional stability of the genome and progresses with tumorigenicity. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions is the recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters is linked to activation of genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Lgf2 overexpression in Wilm´s tumour. Increased expression of the lgf2 gene is responsible for somatic overgrowth</p>
<p>Imprinting is the parental allele-specific expression of a very limited set of genes; depends on an epigenetic marking of parental alleles during gametogenesis. lCRs is read by chromatin barrier formation or untranslated RNAs; only maternal or paternal allele is expressed.</p>
<p>Stability of marked regions in somatic cells is maintain through each cellular replication by a methylation enzyme complex containing Dnmt1</p>
<p>When DMD deletion is paternally inherited, H19 is activated and lgf2 expression is reduced; in the other hand, maternal transmission of the mutation, H19 expression is reduced and lgf2 is activated.</p>
<p>H19 hypermethylated sequences are requires to silence paternally derives H19.</p>
<p>The maternally expressed H19 gene is hypermethylated in the inactive paternal allele in somatic tissues and sperm. Differential methylation must also be present in the gametes and pre-implantation embryo for serve as mark for imprint<br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-28436d4f13bc3d886071456d/970238/asst-5/970238-5212fb479464c9.54001115.png" alt="" /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia. Decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands.</p>
<p>A combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumor growth in some people with advanced lung cancer.</p>
<p>“Drugs had been deployed successfully against a solid tumor, rather than a leukemia or a lymphoma” (The Economist).</p>
<p>Drugs targeting enzymatic epigenetic regulators</p>
<p>DNMT inhibitors: nucleoside analogues, irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, therefore replication dependent.</p>
<p>High-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and secondary leukemias show a high prevalence of tumour-suppressor gene hypermtehylation. The use of irreversible DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, such as azacytidine and decitabine, appears to be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of meylodysplastic syndromes. If agents as decitabine are concomitantly administered with classical anticancer drugs, the resulting induction of transporter expression may influence the disposition and effect of these anticancer drugs. <br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-28436d4f13bc3d886071456d/970238/asst-5/970238-5212fd192f5b45.82222607.png" alt="" /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Forms of gene regulation involving transcription factors and epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive period refers to the effect of experience on the brain particularly string during a limited period in development.</p>
<p>The four planes of development identified are infancy (birth to six years), childhood (six to twelve years), adolescence (twelve to eighteen years) and maturity (eighteen to twenty-four years).</p>
<p>Exposure to drugs early in life can have long-lasting implications for brain structure and function. Children exposed to drugs pre- or postnatally might respond abnormally to therapeutics used to treat the very disorders that they later exhibit as a result of their previous drug exposure.</p>
<p>With epigenetic drugs, it is possible to reverse aberrant gene expression profiles associated with disease states. </p></div>
