    <h1>Submission 800 from Anon (session_user_id: 770c834b1b3a2c6713b4285b08c2ea55e10f0b94)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On one hand the appearance of cancer cells is related to the changed DNA methylation patterns in the cells. So if this pattern is changed or removed cancer can be avoided or treated at least. Decitabine is one of the DNA-demethylating agents sold as Dacogen. It changes the methylation pattern of the DNA so it does not allow methylation on that part of the DNA that is important in the prevetion of cancer (ie.: tumor supressors). So it is main advantage that it can remove tha methyl group from certain part of the DNA. It is used to treat the myelodysplastic syndrome. Together with histon-deacytilase inhibitors azzacitidine is successfully used to slow down the growth of certain kind of tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has enduring efffects on the epigenome because through this process it is decided which genes will be expressed and which won't. In respect of cancer it is imprtant because if methylation happens at the wrong locus (important in gene regulation)  it can have diasterous impact on the health on mammals. It leads to the fermation of cancer. Sensitive period is such period of early development which has enduring effect for the rest of the life. There are a lot of studies about the sensitive period of the brain where certain parts of the brain needs sensory experience in order to develop. We can talk about sensitive period in the early development. Treating in these periods wuold be inadvisible because the connection between the parts of the brain can not come to exist which can have serious effects on the development later on.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands in normal cells are hypomethylated. So there is no methylation at CpG islands. On the other hand in cancer cells the CpG islands are hypermethylated. Most likely CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor supresssor. By hypermethylation tumor supressors are not able to be expressed (they are silenced) so tumor can come to existance. On the other hand the intragenic regions and repetative elments show a different methylation pattern in normal and in cancer cells. In a normal cell these regions are hypermethylated and in cancer cells they are hypomethylated.  It is a general phenomenom that intragenic regions and repetative elements are hypomethylated from the early stage of the illness. As a consequence of this hypomethylation the genome is instable, recombination can happen between the repeats which in a normal cell can not happen because of the hypermethylation that heterochromatizes these regions. By hypomethylation these regions can be activated, make a copy of themselves and transpose.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>By the hypermethylation of ICRs can lead to the loss of imprinting so they are expressed from both parental alleles or none of them. ICRs can be hyper or hypomethylated depends on the function of the genes. In context of H19/lgf2 cluster in the normal cell on the paternal allele the ICR is methylated so it is in a heterochromatized form so on the the maternal allele it is unmethylated and CTCF can bind to the ICR so the enhancer will act on H19. The lgf2 region is silent in the maternal allele and active on the paternal allele. By the disrution of  imprinting in this cluster ( results Wilm's tumor)  methylation can be observed on both alles and lgf2 will be expressed from both alleles. So there will be two doses of lgf2 which leads to Wilm's tumor.</p></div>
