    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is greatly altered in cancer. Genome-wide hypomethylation of intergenetic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability. Hypermethylation of CpG islands and island shores near promotors cause silencing of genes upstream of the promoter. In essence what seems to be happing in cancer is the opposite of what is seen in normal cells.</p>
<p>CpG islands are usually hypomethylated in most cells. Methylation at these sites cause silencing of promotors and thus of the gene upstream. This is tightly regulated in normal cells as silencing of various genes such as tumor suppressor genes can lead to tumorogenisis. In cancer methylation of CpG islands are increased causing more silencing of genes then normally seen. Some of these genes that are silenced are integral in suppressing tumorogenisis such as tumor suppressor genes. As such there is a paradoxical increase in cell growth and proliferation.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in healthy cells are usually methylated which avoids genomic instability such as translocations, deletions, replications as wells as others. Repetitive elements when unmethylated act as transposable elements,cutting and copying itself to others sites. Intergenetic regions when unmethylated lead to the promotion of cryptic promotors the can lead to gene silencing by interfering with proper DNA transcription.<br />In cancer intergentics regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This increased the likely hood of abhorrent genome wide instability. Translocation areseen in many cancers especially of hematopoetic origin leading to creation of chimeric genes and proteins (ex. Bcr/Abl t9:22 "philadelphia chromosome"). Deletions of integral genes in specific chromosomes are also seen in cancers. Inversions are also commonly seen. As such the overall hypomethylation leads to mutanogensis and genetic instability leading to cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting of H19/Igf2 is seen in cancer when it goes wrong. Normally only the paternal allele is methylated and thus allows for Igf2 transcription. When both alleles are methylated these leads to the increase cell proliferation seen in Wilms tumor as well as other diseases. In Wilms tumor the maternal allele is also methylated</p>
<p>Normally the paternal allele is hypermethlated leading to the inactivation of H9. This leads to activation of Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>Normally the maternal allele is hypomethylated leading to activation of H9. This leads to the silencing of Igf2.</p>
<p>What occurs in Wilms tumor is the hypermethation of both alleles leading to an increase in Igf2 transcription. As an oncogene this leads to cell proliferation and tumorogenisis. Unregulated grow occurs. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class called hypomethylation agents. As a cytosine analog Decitabine is incorporated into DNA and blocks irreversibly the activity of DNA methyltranferase as it tries to methylate 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. DNA methylation is profoundly impacted by the decrease in available DNA methyltranferase which causes hypomethylation of the genome. Cancer that has silenced many important genes by methylation of CpG islands near promoter regions are cleared leading to the reactivation of genes involved in anti-tumour activity.</p>
<p>Another mechanism of action of Decitabine is the induction of apoptosis because of abhorent reading of the genome. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>By turning off DNA methylation with the use of epigentic drugs such as Decitibine you can have lasting effect of tumor cells and it's progeny as it is conserved as the cells multiply. Because only certain cells at certain times methylate their genome, use of epigentic drugs have lasting effect on the cells affected. By hypomethylation the cancer cells are now suseptible to drugs because of the activation of genes that where previous silenced. This is why the chemotherapeutics agents given after the use of these epigentic drugs show increased effect.</p>
<p>The sensitive period is the time when the genome is being cleaned of DNA methylation and the setting new methylation patterns. The early embryo, germ cells and primordial stem cells all undergo sensitive periods. As such giving these drugs during pregnancy or people that which to have children might be detrimental to the fetus and there germ cells. </p>
