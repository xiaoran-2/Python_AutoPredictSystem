    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands at particular time points in human gestation is essential for X chromosome inactivation in females and also plays an important role in turning genes on and off. In cancer cells the usual pattern of methylation is often altered resulting in disastrous consequences for normal cellular programming and control. Whilst normal cells will generally display hypermethylation at intergenic regions, repetitive elements and introns as well as hypomethylation at CpG Islands, cancer cells will typically display hypermethylation at CpG islands and hypomethylation in other regions. These abnormalities can result in the silencing of tumour supressor genes and expression of oncogenes respectively. Similarily in disease states methylation at CPG islands can alter imprinted cell states cause and upregulation of certain genes leading to over or under expression of factors important for growth and development. In other parts of the genome such as itergenic regions and repetive element changes in methylation can result in silencing, upregulation or cause genomic instability which can cause translocations deletions and alternate splicing which can all cause disease.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many imprinted genes are important for controlling cell growth by either enhancing or blocking genes that promote or inhibit growth. THe H19/Igf2 cluster is responsible for controlling Igf2 expression via differential methylation on the maternal and paternal alleles. In normal cells the Imprint Control Region (ICR) on the Maternal allele is unmethyated and can be bound by CTCF, an insulator protien which blocks down stream enhancers from acting on Igf2 which results in them enhancing H19 expression instead. In the corresponding paternal allele the ICR is methyated which stops CTCF binding allowing for downstream enhancers to act on Igf2 increasing its expression. Furthermore the H19 promotor is blocked by methylation that has spread from the methylated ICR upstream of it.</p>
<p>This 'balancing' mechanism of imprinting allows for normal growth in cells. Imprinting can be disrupted by mutations or deletions, uniparental disomy or epigenetic disruption. When these disruptions cause the maternal allele to act like the paternal allele imprinting is essentially lost. A loss of imprinting can cause an excess of Igf2, and the simultaneous loss of tumor suppressors which in turn can cause disease states in the organism such as Wilm's Tumour found in children. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA demethylating agent that has potential for treating certain types of cancer precursors (myelodysplastic syndromes) by altering the epigenome of a patient.  Decitabine acts by demethylating promotors of tumor suppressor genes thereby allowing the expression of tumour suppressors which can then act on tumours present or stop them from developing.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that affect the methylation state of stretches of the genome can influence chromatin structure and modify its binding properties changing the assessability of various genes. Such changes are maintained in dividing daughter cells via a methyltransferase which copies the marks into the new population of daughter cells which persists in the epigenome throughout generations of new cells. By modifying methylation its possible that other drugs are able to be more effective in accessing certain areas of the genome.</p>
<p>At certain time points during gestation, active remodelling of the epigenome takes place in order to modify cellular function and create a totipotency state essential for development. These are called sensitive periods as epigentic marks are easily disrupted and genomic stability is temporarily compromised. There are two main sensitive periods in development; the period of primordial germ cell development until the production of gametes and also in the preimplantation and early postimplantation periods. During these sensitive periods of gestation treating pregnant mothers with drugs that can alter the epigenome could have disastrous affects on the fetus as not only are the epigentic marks more easily modified and passed onto daughter cells, they are also essential for development of the feotus.</p></div>
