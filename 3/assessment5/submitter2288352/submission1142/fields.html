    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normally functioning cell, methylation of the C5 in cytosine residues in CpG islands (a cluster of CG dinucleotides often located in the promoter region of a gene) will typically silence the gene which that promoter acts on.  This is important for the purposes of X inactivation, imprinting, and condensing unused portions of the genome into heterochromatin, but otherwise most CpG islands are kept unmethylated so that their promoters may be accessed and activated.  In a cancer cell, CpG islands that should normally remain unmethylated can become silenced by DNA methylation.  Hypermethylation of CpG islands in genes such as tumour suppressors can lead to uncontrolled proliferation.   Often several changes are necessary for a cell to become cancerous, but DNA hypermethylation is actually more frequently seen than mutations to the DNA sequence itself in cancer cells.  For this reason the detection of hypermethylation (even from free DNA in blood) can be used as a biomarker to identify cancers and track regression with treatment, or spread over time, useful for making diagnostics, prognoses, and even making treatment decisions.  Some cancers have been found to contain specific sets of CpG islands that are hypermethylated, called the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype, which vary by tumour type and can be used as biomarkers as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, in normal cells the silencing effect of DNA methylation prevents areas such as intergenic regions and repetitive elements from being transcribed and thus serves to maintain genomic stability. One of the first epigenetic abnormalities discovered to be associated with cancer was the hypomethylation of these areas.  When these regions are hypomethylated and are allowed to become active,  translocations, deletions and insertions can occur depending on the location of the hypomethylation.  These disruptions to the genome are seen early in tumourigenesis and progress over time.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes to the methylation of Imprint Control Regions can cause a loss of imprinting, in which both parental alleles are either turned on, or both are turned off.  Since many ICR act on genes associated with growth regulation, the changes in the dose of these genes could result in an increase in growth or a decrease in growth suppressors, both of which can lead to cancerous proliferation.  These changes are common in pre-neoplastic tissue.  </p>
<p>An example of this is the H19/Igf2 cluster.  Normally, the maternal allele is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind the ICR and have an insulator effect, so that the enhancers cannot act on Igf2 but instead promote H19 transcription, so Igf2 is effectively silenced on the maternal allele.  In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and thus cannot be insulated by CTCF, so the enhancers are allowed to act on Igf2 and it is expressed.  In a childhood cancer of the kidney called Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele is methylated so there is no insulator binding and the enhancers work on Igf2, such that the cells have a double dose of Igf2 resulting in increased growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA approved DNMT1 inhibitor used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors to acute myelogenous leukemia.  These haematological malignancies are a result of tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation, so the demethylating action of decitabine on DNA returns these to an unmethylated state and allows the tumour suppressor gene function to be resumed.  It is a nucleoside analogue which will irreversibly bind DNMT1 after it's incorporation into DNA, and as such is dependent on cell division to function and will preferentially act on rapidly dividing cancer cells.  Decitabine can be toxic at very high doses but has been shown to have a good anti-neoplastic effect at lower doses.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are mitotically inherited.  Changes to the DNA methylation status via epigenetic drugs will become permanently established in the affected cell line.  A cancerous cell, once altered to become non-cancerous, will no longer proliferate in the same uncontrolled way and neither will it's daughter cells.  Changes that allow the function of tumour suppressor genes to be resumed/initiated will be permanent such that these genes can continue to act against inappropriately growing and dividing cells.</p>
<p>However,  the genome is subject to sensitive periods, during which epigenetic marks are removed and reset.  Important marks such as imprinted alleles and silenced repetitive elements are protected and conserved.  These periods of reprogramming occur in the pre-implantation stage (zygote to blastocyst) of an embryo and in during the formation of germ cells.  Artificial disruption of DNA methylation and/or demthylation at these times could cause widespread alterations in the epigenetic marks throughout the genome and lead to serious consequences by means of incorrect gene silencing or activation.  For this reason, use of epigenetic drugs that alter DNA methylation is not advised for young people (undergoing gametogenesis) and women who are pregnant or planning to conceive.</p></div>
