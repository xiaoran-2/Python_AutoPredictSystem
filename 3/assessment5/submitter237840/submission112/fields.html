    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at both CpG islands and the intergenic/repetitive regions is to help regulate gene expression.  However, if there is locus specific DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands and island shores of tumor supressor genes, this can contributes to cancer by silencing tumor supressor genes. In the intergenic regions and repetitive regions we see hypomethylation in cancer which can cause genomic instability leading to illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation of repeats and transpositions, and disruption to neighboring genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decebatine belongs to the DNMTi inhibitors.  The impact is to reduce the hypermethyation surrounding tumor suppressor genes and have an anti-tumor effect by causing re-expression of those tumor supressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA can have enduring effects because epigenetic marks are mitosis heritable -- in other words they can be passed on to daughter cells after cell division.  The sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are laid down.  This sensitive periods are at the blastocyte stage of fetal development and during gamete development in children.  Treatment patients during the sensitive period would be inadvisable because the changes in epigenetic marks resulting from treatment could be passed on to future generations. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic imprinting refers to a situation where genes are expressed in a parent of origin specific status.  Igf2 is the insulin growth factor gene and it is expressed based upon the non-imprinted from the father.  Normally, on the paternal gene there is methylation that inactivates an adjascent gene that would suppress expression.  And on material gene, there is no methylation so the Igf2 gene is suppressed.   In Wilms tumor the methylation is disrupted causing improper expression of the two alleles.</p>
<p>Various articles from PubMed were used in responding to this question including Morris et al. Multigene Methylation Analysis of Wilms Tumor etc. </p></div>
