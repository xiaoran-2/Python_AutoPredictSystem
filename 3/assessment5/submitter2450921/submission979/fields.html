    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are in the promoters of cancer supressor genes. The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is that DNA methylation at CpG islands are a way to either turn off a gene or turn it on. Hypermethylation in CpG islands occur frequently in tumours.This is because with cancer,hypermethylation of CpG islands disrupts the normal function of these genes by turning off the promoter. There is a direct corralation between hypermethylation of CpG islands and the progression of the cancer.</p>
<p>In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated which prevents three things; deletions, abnormal reciprocal translocations, and insertions of genes. In cancer cells, repetitive elements and intergenic regions, are hypomethylated, and this hypomethylation in cancer cells, progresses over time. Abnormal recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transpositions results in abnormal activation of promoters and thus resulting in the disruption of neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal genome is demethylated actively in the fertilized egg and is remethylated from the blastocyst on. There is a second phase of genomic imprinting, this happens in the primordial germ cells where they are methylated so they can regain their (sperm and eggs) distinction and necessary machinery in order to carry out their jobs as sperm and egg. The maternal genome is passively demethylated to the blastocyst more slowly than the paternal genome. But like the paternal genome it is remethylated from the blastocyst. This done by demethyltransferase being excluded in the nucleus and methyl DNA is diluted through cell division. In the remethylation of the primordial germ cells the paternal cells are methylated faster than the maternal cells. This is due to different functions of the two groups of cells. H19 is unmethylated on maternal allele and methylated on paternal allele. CTCF isolates igf2 from downstream enhancers, and the enhancers can interact with H19 on the maternal allele. On the paternal allele, H19 is methylated and CTCF can't bind to the imprint control regions and thus interacts with igf2 and is expressed as a growth promoting gene. An example of this is Wilm's kidney tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating class of epigenetic inhibitors. Decitabine demethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase which binds methyl groups to DNA. These methyl groups silence genes including tumour suppessor genes.So with DNA methy;transferase inhibited, the normal function of genes, including tumour suppressor genes, can proceed, along with anti-tumour genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation alters the expression of the genome by adding or removing methyl groups on DNA. The addition or deletion of methyl groups is normally permanent and persists throughout the life of the organism. It can also be passed on to offspring. There is a lack of specificity to drugs that alter epigenetic changes in DNA, so detramental consequences can happen in gene therapy. There are sensitive periods in an organisms life where this lack of specificity would be detramental, an example of a sensitive period is the developement of primordial germ cells into gametes which would lead to alterations in the genome of future offspring. Another example of a sensitive period is in the early development of the zygote where epigenetic reprogramming is taking place. Because of the non-specificity of treatment during these sensitive periods, there would be unforseen consiquences.</p></div>
