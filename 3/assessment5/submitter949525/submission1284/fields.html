    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><br />Decitabine is a hypomethylating (demethylating) agent.  Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.  Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by restoring the function of tumor suppressor genes that have been silenced by DNA methylation.     <br /><br />Decitabine is sold under the brand name Dacogen and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2006 as a Nucleoside Metabolic Inhibitor for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).  MDS are the precursors for myelogenous leukemia.<br /></span></p></div>

In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p class="s2">Cancer begins with the disregulated growth of an abnormal cell that is able to divide faster than its normal counterparts. In cancers, there is a genome wide lack of methylation.  This is a more consistent feature of cancer than  genetic mutations.  A link between DNA methylation and cancer was first found in 1983.</p>
<div>
<p class="s2"><span class="s3">DNA methylation of promoter regions usually correlates inversely with gene expression.  However, </span>DNA methylation at CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters, is an exception.  In normal cells, CpG islands are usually free of methylation, thus allowing expression of the underlying gene.  In cancer cells, the CpG islands of promoters are hypermethylated, causing silencing of the underlying gene, including any tumour suppressor genes, whose function is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.   DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands has been linked to colorectal cancer, glioma and breast cancer, among others.</p>
<p class="s2"><span class="s3">Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated.  The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and at repetitive elements is to defend the genome and maintain genomic stability. At intergenic regions DNA methylation functions to silence cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites.   It also functions at repetitive elements to silence repeats, thus preventing transposition and avoiding transciptional interference from strong promoters.  It also prevents transposition by mutating repeats (meC to T) and preventing illegitimate recombination.  </span></p>
<p class="s2"><span> </span>Genomic instability enhances tumorigenesis.   Hypomethylation of the intergenic regions leads to genomic instability by allowing illegitimate combinations between repeats, deletions,  insertions and reciprocal translocations, which can lead to transcription aberrations.  Loss of normal DNA methylation patterns in somatic cells results in loss of growth control.</p>
<p class="s2"><span class="s3">Abnormal DNA methylation patterns occur in many other diseases, including autoimmune diseases such as lupus and neurodevelopmental syndromes such as fragile X.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome that last beyond the period of drug treatment because the epigenetic changes are stable.  Once the drug treatment has altered the epigenome, the previous, cancer-causing epigenetic methylation pattern does not return.  Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to subsequent generations of cells, until or unless something happens to alter the DNA methylation again.  <br /><br />Sensitive periods are those in which there is increased sensitivity to to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanics and those where altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control. </span>Examples of environmental effects include hatching temperature and the sex of turtles, Royal Jelly creating a queen bee and maternal licking and future stress levels in mice.</p>
<p><span>Sensitive periods of development include the period from primordial germ cell development through production of mature eggs and sperm (gametogenesis) and the preimplantation – postimplantation period.  Both periods are periods of active remodeling of the epigenome involving reprogramming of DNA methylation and the laying down of epigentic marks. </span></p>
<p><span>Treating patients during a sensitive period is not advisable because it can negatively impact the gametes or a fetus.  Decitabine is classified as a category D pregnancy risk.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinted epigenetic marks through gain or loss of DNA methylation, changes the normal allele-specific gene expression.  The Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor 2)gene is an imprinted gene that is normally expressed from the paternal allele.  Igf2 is involved in growth and development and plays a major role as a growth promoting hormone during gestation.   </p>

<div class="layoutArea"><span>The H19 gene is involved in growth/tumor suppression.  Normally the paternal copy of H19 is methylated and silent while the maternal copy is hypomethylated and therefore expressed.  <br /><br />The Igf2 gene and H19 gene are located near each other on chromosome 11.  In normal cells the paternal Igf2 and maternal H19 are expressed.  In disruption of normal imprinting, methylation of the H19 promoter reverses the pattern of the maternal allele to that of the paternal allele, turning on the Igf2 allele and turning off the H19 allele.  This results in excessive cell growth, leading to disease.  <br /><br />Wilm's tumor is a cancer of the kidneys that affects mainly young children.  Characterization of the imprinting and expression status of Igf2 and H19 in Wilm's tumor have shown a bipaternal epigenotype at the Igf2/H19 locus with Igf2 biallelically active and H19 inactive.   <br /></span>             </div>
