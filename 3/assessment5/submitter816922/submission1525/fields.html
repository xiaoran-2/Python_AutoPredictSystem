    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, DNA methylation can either be hypermethylated (methyl groups found in excess) or hypomethylated (low levels of methyl groups). When DNA is found to be hypermethylated, the excess methyl groups are found at CpG islands. Normally, CpG islands are found in the region just before a promoter of a gene and are unmethylated. The absence of methyl groups allows genetic machinery to be recruited to the promoter and the gene to be transcribed. When the CpG island is methylated it blocks transcription, essentially turning the gene off. If the gene being turned off is a tumor supressor gene then the cell is more likely to become cancerous. When a cell is found to hypomethylated, the methyl groups are missing from areas genome wide such as repetitive elements intergenic regions. The reason that these areas are methylated in normal cells is to stop an area from being transcribed. Methylation in intergenic regtions can cause the DNA to be inaccessible by packaging it up into hetrochromatin or by blocking the genetic machinery from transcribing an area. When hypomethylation happens in repetitive elements, it can cause illegitimate recombination between alleles. These recombinations are not always perfect and can lead to mismatched alleles. Mismatched alleles lead to genes being displaced or cut up, making them unable to read. If this were to happen in a tumor supressor gene, it could lead to a higher possibility of cancer forming in a normal cell. When the methylation is found in intergenic regions it can cause the activation of genes that should be turned off or lead to areas of nonsense DNA to be transcribed. If an oncogene is turned on in this way it can add to the chance of cancer forming.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a drug that belongs to a class known as  DNA-methylating agents. Cells exposed to d<span>ecitabine would cause areas heavy with CpGs to become methylated. The target of this drug are the areas that become hypomethylated in cancer cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, that are found genome wide. By methylating these areas it would decrease the chance of unwanted recombinations between alleles and stop the activation of oncogenes. Unfortunately, it would also cause methylation of any CpG islands that are not already hypermethylated, deactivation tumor supressor genes. This drug is used in ailments that are precursory to cancer where, presumably, the hypermethylation and hypomethylation have already occured, decreasing the chance of methylation of CpG islands.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can affect </p>
<p>The state of DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. This means that if a change is made in methylation, the next generation of cells from that cell line will have the new  state of methylation. So changing the epigenetic state of a cancerous cell with treatment will be seen in later generations of the cancerous cells even after treatment has stopped. The other reason that  DNA methylation can have a lasting effect is that changes in the state of methylation can only be reset or changed back during sensitive periods, early embryo development and gametogenesis. During sensitive periods, the state of methylation is reset so that either gametes can form or for the developing embryo to have stem cells. It should not be possible for a cancer cell to reverse the change in methylation in a child or adult without further mutation of the genome. For this reason, pregnant patients shouldn't be treated with agents that change the state of DNA methylation because the fetus, would have their entire genome exposed to the agent, causing large scale changes to the genome, most likely resulting in a nonviable fetus.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in imprinting can contribute to cancer being formed early in development. A good example of this is the H19/lgf2 gene cluster. The gene lgf2 is a growth promotor. If lgf2 has the potential to be an oncogene if it is over expressed. In the H19/lgf2 cluster, the methylation of either the maternal or paternal allele determines how enhancer molecules act on the allele, expressing H19 or lgf2. Normally, the maternal allele is methylated at the imprint control region (ICR) and the paternal allele is unmethylated. On the maternal allele, the unmethylated ICR allows the protein CTCF to bind to the ICR causing lgf2 to be insulated from the enhancers. Since the enhancers can not get to lgf2, they instead act on H19 causing it to be expressed and lgf2 to be silenced. On the paternal allele, the ICR being methylated stops CTCF from binding. This allows enhancers to act on lgf2, expressing it and silencing H19. If the imprinting of the maternal allele during development is disrupted and the ICR becomes methylated, it would cause lgf2 to be expressed twice as much as normal. This would promote uncontrolled gene growth, increasing the chance of cancer.</p></div>
