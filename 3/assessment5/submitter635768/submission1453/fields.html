    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation occurs in CpG islands. It has been seen that gene expression is inversely proportioned with CpG islands methylation in promotors. In cancer, it has been observed that specific loci are hypermethylated and there was a general hypomethylation genome-wide. This disruption leads to altered expression of genes where tumour suppressor genes tend to be silenced and hypermethylated, while oncogenes tend to be activated and hypomethylated.  Intergenic and repetitive regions are found methylated through out the genome to eliminate their disruptive role in destabilizing the genome when expressed. There has been a correlation between hypomethylation and the expression of repetitive elements and intergenic regions, at least in mouse models. When expressed, and interference with RNA or DNA is highly potential. Furthermore, repetitive elements can transpose themselves elsewhere in the genome, which can go on  disrupting  gene expression control regions like promoters, enhancer and etc. When repeats are hypomethylate, this can lead to abnormal recombination because they are usually found to be long and repetitive which leads to repetitive regions recognizing each other and recombine. The disruptive element in this is that it can happen between non homologous chromosomes. Moreover, repitive elements contain cryptic promoters, when these are hypomethylated it could activate gene expression of downstream genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is imprinted where the paternal allele of Igf2 is expressed and the maternal allele of H19 is expressed. The cluster contains an imprint control region (ICR) that act as a ligand to the CTCF protein. When ICR is bound to CTCF, the enhancer which are found downstream promote H19 expression. However, when ICR is not bound to CTCF, DNA methylation will spread to include both the ICR and the promoter of H19 allowing the enhancers to promote Igf2 expression. It was found that a regions found upstream of Igf2 ,that has methylation differences between the maternal and paternal chromosome, also play a role in the imprinting process.  To clarify, ICR is bound to CTCF in the maternal chromosome allowing H19 expression and it is methylated in the paternal chromosome allowing for Igf2 expression. In Wilm's tumour, the maternal chromosome's ICR is methylated and acts like the paternal chromosome allowing for a biallelic expression of the growth promoting Igf2, this causes over expression of the gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that can alter epigenetic pathways by inhibiting certain protein from performing their function. It belongs to a class of drugs DNA demethylase inhibitors. In this class only decitibine and another drug called azacitidine that are currently FDA approved for cancer treatment. Their function is by inhibiting DNMT1. The inhibition process starts with having the active form of Decitabine associating with unmethylated DNA, DNMT1 recognizes the product of this association and binds without being able to unbind. This cause the drug to induce hypomethylation in the genome, this leads to having a therapeutic benefit in treating cancer cases dependant on a hypermethylated locus. Decitibine is used to day to treat haematological cancers because they rely on a hypermethylated locus. Today, a new a approach of combining more than one epigenetic pathway inhibitors, including decitabine, to treat solid tumours. It is worth mentioning also that decitibine did not show, so far, any serious symptoms compared with chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr">Cancers possess a special type of cells called cancer stem cells (CSC). These cells have many features in common with the normal stem cells. One of these is that they lack many differential methylation marks, allowing for these marks to be laid again and be mitotically heritable. Using Epigentic drugs that alter the DNA methylation process in these CSC will make these cells more vulnerable than the already differentiated cancer cells.  Because these cell are undergoing through a sensitive period. A sensitive period is a period when methylation  are cleared and then laid again or reprogramming. Mammalian cells have two sensitive periods; during early development specifically from fertilization till the formation of an epiblast, where the marks are completely removed during blastocyst formation, the second period is from the formation of primordial germ cells until germ cells maturation. It is worth mentioning here that it is considered inadvisable to treat patients during these sensitive periods with drugs that target epigenetic pathways, because any alteration will become mitotically heritable to that cell daughters. And that’s the reason why new epigenetic drugs are tested cautiously in their approval process.</p></div>
