    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is addition of methyl group at 5’ end of cytosine, which exclusively occurs in Cytosine followed by Guanine in mammals. This prohibits transcription factor binding at the promoter region, which is methylated. Hence this gene is not transcribed and are silenced.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is observed that Cancer cells have relatively high level of specific CpG island methylation, compared to normal cells. These methylation tend to silence genes coding for tumor suppression. These are the genes responsible for suppressing tumorigenesis in nornal cells, eg. Retinoblastoma. When these genes are silenced, oncogenes are not suppressed, hence giving rise to Cancer cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Disruption of CpG island methylation may result in either over-expression of any unwanted gene(hypomethylation), or can even cause suppression of any essential gene(hypermethylation). This can readily give rise to disease in the individual.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Intergenic regions are important for genomic stability. they can sometimes act as promoters for attachment of transcription factors causing unwanted transcription, which can also interfere with adjoining necessary transcriptions. Repetitive elements also codes for strong promoters wich cause transcription of adjoining non coding regions, which will result in unwanted expression. Methylation of these intergenic regions and repetitive elements prevents these ambiguous transcriptions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cancer cells, there is considerable decrease in overall methylation of genome. This hypomethylation occurs mainly in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This leads to genomic instability causing deletions, translocations or insertions, and also activation of oncogenes which are normally silent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Disruption in methylation of Intergenic regions and Repetitive elements causes general genomic instability. This results in chromosomal errors like translocation, deletion or insertion. They can give rise to severe disorders in the individual depending upon which genes are affected.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region of paternal H19/Igf2 cluster is normally methylated. This methylation is often passed on downstream as well, causing silencing of H19 gene. When imprint control region of paternal allele is methylated, the insulating protein CTCF cannot bind to it, and enhancers are free to directly transcribe the Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>In maternal allele, the imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster is un-methylated. Because of which, CTCF protein binds to the imprint control region. This protein acts as an insulator for binding of enhancers to the Igf2 gene, and hence causing transcription of only H19 gene and not Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, maternal allele of H19/Igf2 cluster is also methylated just like paternal allele in case of normal cells. So there is expression of Igf2 gene from both paternal and maternal chromosomes. This increased dosage causes increase in growth factor which usually results in childhood kidney tumor.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinted control genes as in H19/Igf2 cluster leads to various abnormalities. It causes upregulation of Igf2 gene, which is an oncogene. Excess of growth promoters cause diseases when clubbed with other mutation or epigenetic disorders.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.</p>
<p>Decitabine acts by inhibiting activity of DNMT1 to bring about methylation in hemi-methylated cells. So, as cells divide, they are not methylated because of inhibiting activity of Decitabine. Such cells are slowly demethylated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Decitabine is used to demethylate DNA specially in case of tumor cells. Since cancer cells are rapidly dividing, they require subsequent methylation, which is prevented by Decitabine. Usage of Decitabine in a proper dosage (usually low) disrupts the epigenetic marks, but retains only some necessary DNA methylation, causing death of tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike regular forms of gene regulation which are specific for each cell only, DNA methylation is a type of epigenetic marker. And these changes are mitotically heritable. They will keep on passing from one cell to daughter cell until they are completely erased. In such manner, they might take away the abnormality as well along with them while getting removed.</p>
<p>Drugs which modify epigenetic markers are not used in patients in their sensitive period. This is the period when their body cells are susceptible to epigenetic changes which can not only alter the abnormal cells, but also affect the normal cells.</p>
<p>These sensitive periods can be when the patient’s germ cells are undergoing division or maturation.</p>
<p>Since these patients have germ cells under developmental line-up, they are not to be given drugs which can disrupt epigenetic marks. As, such changes can not only affect the abnormal cells, but also create abnormal epigenetic marks in germ cells, which is again harmful.</p></div>
