    <div class="field-value"><p>Today, cancer is seen as a disease resulting from both genetic and epigenetic abnormalities altering gene expression.</p>
<p><strong>In normal cells</strong>, CpG islands (CGIs) are usually not methylated. CGIs are found at gene promoters and if a CGI is hypermethylated, it means that the gene is silenced.</p>
<p><strong>In cancer</strong>, both CpG islands and CGI shores are hypermethylated and this occurs in the promoters of <em>tumor suppressor genes</em>. Those genes are thus silenced with the same consequences as if the genes were genetically mutated, so epimutations can act as some of the hits proposed by Knudson hypothesis. Epigenetic mutations are mitoticaly heritable and more common than genetic mutations; epimutated cells have a selective advantage over the normal cells, they divide rapidly and rarely die, taking over the normal tissue. DNA hypermethylation is also locus specific: different tumors have different CGIs or sets of CGIs hypermethylated (e.g. CpG island methylator phenotype CIMP), but hypermethylation progresses with time.</p>
<p><strong>In normal cells</strong>, repetitive elements, intergenic regions and even introns are hypermethylated, and heterochromatinized, thus <em>maintaining the stability of genome</em>.</p>
<p><strong>In cancer</strong>, there's a genome-wide <em>hypomethylation</em>, particularly in the repeats and intergenic regions. This is one of the earliest epigenetic aberrations seen in cancer, and the one that leads to genomic instability. Results of intergenic and repetitive elements' hypomethylation may be insertions or deletions of chromosomes thus gaining or losing genetic material, respectively, illegitimate recombinations, or transpositions of repeats. These transpositions may disrupt the coding gene or may activate a strong and/or cryptic promoter. Genome-wide hypomethylation can also lead to activation of oncogenes, as shown in the example of R-RAS oncogene activation in gastric cancer because of hypomethylation of its promoter which is a CpG poor promoter.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are expressed only from one allele, and this expression is specific to the parent-of-origin. They are found in clusters with each cluster having its own imprint control region (ICR). Loss of imprinting occurs very early in cancer development, either through hypomethylation or hypermethylation.</p>
<p>H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted, so ICR is methylated on the paternal allele. This methylation spreads to nearby lncRNA gene H19 leading to its silencing, while at the same time allowing downstream enhancers to activate Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>ICR is unmethylated on maternal allele and it binds CTCF insulator protein. CTCF blocks the action of enhancers on Igf2, and therefore Igf2 is not expressed from maternal allele while H19 is.</p>
<p>Igf2 imprinting is lost in Wilms' tumor, a kidney tumor occuring in childhood, due to hypermethylation of ICR on maternal allele. This hypermethylation allows for Igf2 to be expressed from maternal allele, together with the expression of Igf2 from paternal allele. There's now an overexpression (double dose) of Igf2 which is a growth promoting oncogene meaning that cells just continue to divide. An overexpression of oncogenes may lead to cancer if more insults, genetic or epigenetic, are added to the genome,</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. Decitabine blocks the activity of DNMT1 enzyme.</p>
<p>When a cell divides, daughter cells have one methylated DNA strand from parental cell and one new unmethylated strand. DNMT1 uses this hemi-methylated DNA as a substrate and lays down the methyl groups.</p>
<p>Decitabine incorporates into DNA and binds DNMT1 irreversibly, thus stopping DNA methylation. This can only happen during DNA replication (cell division). Cancer cells divide rapidly so they are affected the most, but any normal cell that undergoes division could be affected as well. There could also be other mechanisms of actions of decitabine.</p>
<p>Decitabine is used to treat myelodisplastic syndrome where there's CGIs hypermethylation of tumor suppresor genes. It is used in low doses which have the greatest effect and are well tolerated by the patients. It could be combined with other epigenetic drugs or chemotherapeutics.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation that are caused by epigenetic drugs can be mitotically heritable. With each new cell division, DNA hypermethylation will gradually dilute, and cancerous daughter cells will lose some of epigenetic marks that make them cancerous. Also, they might become more sensitive to chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are periods when genetic reprogramming occurs, meaning that epigenetic marks are cleared between generations and then reset again. There are two such periods: early pre-implantation development and period of primordial germ cell development. Imprinted genes are reset only during PGC development. Also, in females, oocytes continue to mature after the birth. </p>
<p>Epigenetic drugs affect every cell in the body and epigenetic changes can persist long after exposure to the drug(s). If used during sensitive periods of development, when cells are most vulnerable to environmental insults, they could cause disruption in epigenetic reprogramming. Clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks could be adversely affected, especially for imprinted genes. So, there is a concern regarding usage of epigenetic drugs to treat young children and pregnant women. These drugs should be avoided in treatment of these patients because future generations might be affected with various disorders, imprinted disorders included.</p>
