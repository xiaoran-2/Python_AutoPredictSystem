    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG sites contributes to genomic homeostasis, imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, establishment of transcriptional regulation and chromatin as well as suppression of repetitive elements and carcinogenesis. Stretches of DNA near promoter regions have high concentrations of CpG islands that are usually unmethylated. Excessive DNA methylation of these CpG islands can lead to cancer development as hypermethylated promoters result in transcriptional silencing of tumour-suppressor genes. Methyl CpG plays a role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression, it impedes binding of transcriptional proteins that affect gene expression. The methyl group also acts as a signal recognized by methyl CpG binding domain proteins. These recruit repressive proteins like histone deacetylases and chromatin remodelers to form inactive heterochromatin. Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease processes or cancer by the loss of methyl CpG binding domain proteins (MBD1,2,3,4 and MeCP2).  As a result the proteins are unable to bind to DNA or turn genes on or off, so genes that are normally repressed remain active or genes are not activated to make protein products, which disrupts normal cell functions leading to disease or tumor formation. DNA methylation usually occurs in the intergenic and repetitive elements to maintain the integrity of the genome. It prevents chromosomal deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. It also silences cryptic transcription start or splice sites. Methylation of repetitive elements silences repeats to prevent transpositions and transcriptional interferences. Methylation also prevents mutations of repeats, illegitimate recombinations and protects the genome from activation of transposable elements. Cancer develops from global hypomethylation and aberrant demethylation of intergenic and repetitive elements, which triggers genome-wide instability, aberrant transcriptions and gene disruptions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Each autosomal gene is represented by 2 alleles, a maternal and paternal copy inherited from the parents. Some genes are imprinted so that gene expression is from 1 allele only. The expressed allele is dependent on the parent of origin with the gene encoding Igf2 only expressed on the paternal allele and silenced on the maternal allele. Igf2 and H19 are reciprocally imprinted so that H19 is silenced on the paternal allele and expressed in the maternal allele. Imprinting is an epigenetic process involving DNA methylation and histone modulation in order to achieve monoellelic gene expression without changing the gene sequence. The epigenetic mark is present in the germline and maintained through mitotic divisions. Alterations in DNA methylation patterns at imprinted gene loci by hypo or hypermethylation result in loss of expression of growth restriction genes and overexpression of growth promotion genes. Wilm’s tumor is the result of loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 imprinting control region. Igf2, which promotes cell growth, is overexpressed while H19 that hinders cell growth is underexpressed. The result is uncontrolled cell growth leading to tumor development. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent that causes inhibition of DNA methylation by blocking methyltransferase activity. Decitabine is developed as an epigenetic regulating drug, a cytidine analog, which binds with DNA methyltransferase. The replicating daughter strand gets a copy of the methylation, as the bound DNA methyltransferase is irreversible. Epigenetic regulation by methyltransferase inhibition results in loss of methylations in DNA and histone proteins. Hypomethylated histones can either repress or stimulate transcription in the promoter region of genes to prevent excessive expression of cell transition or proliferation. These modified epigenetic changes counter cancer development through gene expression for tumor suppression and inhibit cancer cell division by causing DNA damage and chromosomal instability. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is not a mutation as it does not change genetic sequences. Methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to DNA creating a stable epigenetic modification that is transmitted during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells. This makes methylation alterations or epigenetic changes non-mutational and heritable with enduring effects to repress or reduce transcription factors to stop overgrowth and cancer development. Sensitive periods of development are during rapid cell division at embryonic and fetal development stages and during puberty. It is inadvisable use epigenetic treatment during these periods because epigenetic processes are cell division dependent, and has the potential to induce widespread changes. Activating gene transcription in normally replicating cells may make them cancerous, triggering the very disease process that epigenetic treatment is supposed to counter. In order for epigenetic treatment to be successful, it should be selective and target abnormal cells to stop their proliferation with minimal damage or long term consequences to normal cells. </p></div>
