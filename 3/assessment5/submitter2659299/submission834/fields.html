    <div class="field-value"><p align="justify">CpG islands are unmethylated in normal cells, but the density of methylation becomes higher when invasion is produced. The function of methylation here is to predict if a gene could be expressed or not. On the other hand, disruption of DNA methylation of CpG islands in cancer is produced when there are promoters with low density of this pair of nucleotides. Then hypomethylation is produced and also the activation of associated genes, such as R-RAS. In this case, disruption of DNA methylation leads to oncogene activation.<br /><br /></p>
<p align="justify">The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic stability. This way the genome remains normal and chromosomes are not lost.</p>
<p align="justify">Disruption of DNA methylation in here can be produced when there is euchromatin, because recombination needs open chromatin to be produced. In this case, disruption of DNA methylation leads to enhacing of tumorogenesis because hypomethylation produces genomic instability and its consequent deletions, insertions,...</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p align="justify">In the paternal allele, H19 is methylated. This way the enhancers can act on Igf2 because CTCF is not binding to the insulator element, and Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p align="justify">In the maternal allele, H19 is not methylated. CTCF then binds to its insulator element and enhancers act on H19 instead of Igf2 as before. Igf2 is silenced and expression can't be produced.</p>
<p align="justify">In Wilm's tumour a loss of imprinting can be found. The reason of this is a double dose of Igf2 because both alleles are methylated, instead of a monoallelic expression like is shown in the normal case.</p>
<p align="justify">Disrupting this imprinting can lead to disease because Igf2 produces overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p align="justify">Decitabine belongs to the group of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. It's a drug approved for avoiding myelodysplastic syndrome to progress to acute myologenous leukaemia (AML). Its effect depends on the dose: up to a point it can produce DNA demethylation, but its toxicity increases at very high concentrations as well as its specificity decreases. Although its mechanism of action is not clear yet, as nucleoside analogue it can bind the enzyme (DNA methyltransferase) and inhibit it. It depends on replication.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p align="justify">Alterations include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes genomic instability and deregulation of imprinted and tissue specific genes. It also produces silencing of tumor suppressor genes by hypermethylation of their promoter in the CpG islands.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Sensitive periods are those most sensitive to the effect of the environment over the epigenome. One of them is the period of primordial cells development. Another one is the pre-implatantion and early post-implantation period. In these periods, treating patients would be inadvisable because the epigenome would be actively remodeling, and the drugs using for the treatment would have a minimum effect.</p></div>
