    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Normally, CpG islands are hemimethylated when we consider both the strands while the intergenic regions and the repeats are methylated.</li>
<li>In cancer cells, the CpG islands are heavily methylated while the repeats,CpG poor promoters, intergenic regions are hypomethylated and perhaps there is genome-wide hypomethylation observed</li>
<li>Normally, CpG islands are present in the promoter regions of tumour suppresor genes. Hence, if the CpG islands are hypermethylated, the tumour suppressors are silenced and hence there is a strong promotion of transcription of oncogenes and hence it leads to uncontrolled and unregulated division of cells seen in cancer.</li>
<li> The repetitive elements , in a normal cell, are involved in genetic abberant recombination and some of them are transposons which jump within the genome causing genomic instability. The intergenic regions are non-coding regions of the genome between the exons and they help regulation of expression of several genes.The repetitive elements regions are usually methylated to keep them silenced to help in genome stability.</li>
<li>In cancer cells, the intergenic and repetitive elements are hypomethylated and as a result, they lead to genomic instability due to random jumping of gene elements within the chromosome.</li>
<li>Also,due to hypomethylation , these areas are activated and hence those regions which needs to be inactive, becomes active. This leads to an overall disorder in the genome and the epigenetic regulation is lost.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is an oncogene which is regulated by H19, an imprint control region of Igf2. Igf2 is paternally imprinted and has H19 methylated in the paternal chromosome,so that the enhancers cannot activate the Igf2 and hence Igf2 is silenced. In Wilm's syndrome,one of the methyl transferases that methylate the H19 ICP is defective and hence the enhancers activate the Igf2, leading to tumour formation</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to histone demethylases .It removes the methyl group on the  lysine of the histone tails therby site-specific hypermethylation which is a major contributor for the metastasis of cancer can be reversed to a certain extent. But the problem with these drugs is that they are not that specific. As a result , those necessary methylations could be removed by these demethylases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>If the DNA methylation pattern is altered, as epigenetic modifications are mitotically inheritable, these changes can be carried onto the next generation. Hence a drug which has an epigenetic mode of action, can be mitotically heritable to the next progeny of cells and this is especially advantageous in cancer as the cells are continuously multiplying.</li>
<li>Sensitive period is a period during which there is epigenetic reprogramming taking place in the genome( ie. the early embryonic development and the primordial germ cell development). If there is mistake in the reprogramming , it could lead to serious genetic consequences and abnormal phenotypes.</li>
<li>When we treat patients during sensitive periods, there are possibilities that the modification we have made, to be erased during epigenetic reprogramming and our treatment becomes futile.Hence it is not advisable</li>
