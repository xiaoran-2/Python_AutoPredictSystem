    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>

    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>

        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.

        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the most stable epigenetic marks that directly alter the genome. By defenition, DNA methylation must be mititocally heretibale from one cell to the other, for it to be considered an epigentic mark. (1) Even after periods of treatment with methylation altering drugs, there can be persisting effects on the epigenome that last, especially if these drugs are giving during epigenetic senstive periods. Sensitive periods are those intervals of development that are most sensitive to the environment and when the growing organism is epigenetically reprogramed. There are generally two sensitive periods during human growth: the pre-implantation period of the embryo and the primordial germ cell period of growth up until to mature gametogenesis. (2) Treating with epigenetic drugs in these sensitive periods could cause unforseen results on the normal somatic cells and the developing gametes. These sensitive periods are when the epigenome is most pliable and can cause sever conseqounces like fatality or locked general alterations on how the genome is expressed. (2) </p>
