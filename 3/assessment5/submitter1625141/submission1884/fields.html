    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In somatic cell CpG islands, which usually occur at or near the transcription start site of genes, are genes promoter and in normal cell are in general hypomethylated. In cancer cell promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing genes like housekeeping genes or tumour suppressor genes In normal cell CpG dinucleotid founded in intergeneric region and repetitive element are in general methylated, but in cancer cell as general rule this regions are hypomethylated. Normally hypermethylation is associated with genome stability, but in cancer cell due the hypomethylation of repetitive element is possible to incure (incorrere) in illegitimate recombination between repeats or activation of repeats and transposition which cause chromosome deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocation. In cancer cell the CpG poor promoter became hypomethylated which is responsible for the activation of the associated genes (oncogene activation).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Common feature of cancer cells is that they display loss of imprinting, genes that should be display mono allelic parent origins specific expression (imprinted) no longer show this imprinted expression but rather become either expressed in both parent alleles or silenced in both parent alleles.<br />In normal cell in the H19/Igf2 cluster the ICR region is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. The maternal unmethylated ICR bind with the CTCF insulator and prevent the Enhancers to activate the Igf2.<br />In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, the CTCF insulator can not longer be bound with the ICR and the enhancers can activate the Igf2 expression. With loss of imprinting also the ICR on the maternal allele is methylated (hypermethylation) and the Igf2 is expressed on both alleles causing a double dose of Igf2 compare with a normal cell. Igl2 is grown promoting and it is associated with Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitabine drugs, a DNMT inhibitor, is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.<br />Nucleoside analogues are incorporated in the DNA and when the DNMT come along to bind that nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand <br />the DNMT is bind irreversibly and can not longer be release and this means that the DNMT inhibitor is replication dependent. Cancer cell that replicated more rapidly than normal cells will be more sever effected.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation (epigenetic changes) are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.<br />Sensitive periods are the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development of the individual susceptible to environmental signals.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because in this stage the DNA is epigenetic hardly reprogrammed (clearing of DNA methylation).</p></div>
