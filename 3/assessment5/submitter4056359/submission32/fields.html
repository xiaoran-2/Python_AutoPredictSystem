    <div class="field-value"><p>In healthy cells, the methylation of CpG islands is laid down by DNMT3a and maintained in cell lines by DNMT1. CpG islands are usually found within the promoter region of a gene, when the CpG islands is methylated it acts to silence or inactivate the gene. However it must be noted that CpG islands are protected from methylation and the majority of CpG islands are unmethylated. In cancerous cells we tend to find that the CpG islands are hypermethylated, meaning that the majority of CpG dinucleotides are methylated, opposing what we normally see in healthy cells. In cancerous cells we tend to see CpG hypermethylation in the promoter regions of tumour suppression genes, and indeed this is often more common than genetic mutations. If the tumour suppressor genes promoter has hypermethylation CpG islands, the gene is silenced and the cancerous cell can proliferate freely without undergoing apoptosis, for this to occur however multiple tumour suppressor genes must be knocked out, as noted in the Knudson hypothesis.</p>
<p>                Again in healthy cells, we also see methylation at intergeneic regions and repetitive elements, these regions tend to be methylated across the genome in healthy cells, opposed to the usual unmethylated CpG islands. The methylation of these regions promotes the genomic stability of the cell and also silences the repetitive elements to prevent transposition throughout the genome. In cancerous cells we find that that these intergeneic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylation, the reverse of healthy cells. This contributes to disease as without methylation at repetitive elements they are free to transpose across the genome promoting genomic instability. This leads to reciprocal translocations, deletions or insertions, all of which can contribute to tumourigenesis. Evidence of the increase in genomic instability has been seen in DNMT1 knockout mice where methylation could not be conserved.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA Hypomethylater categorised into the DNA-demethylating class , by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase Decitabine reduces the amount of epigenome wide methylation that occurs on the DNA strand only (Decitabine cannot prevent the methylation of RNA strands whereas Azacitidine can). This can have an anti tumour effect as in cells where DNA methyltranferase is overacted the histones surround tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated and the genes silenced. Decitabine prevents this histone methylation and in turn the tumour suppressor genes are expressed in euchromatin which helps to prevent tumourigenisis as the associated RNA can be generated. It is licensed to treat myelodysplastic syndrome a precursor to myelogenous leukemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Across the epigenome DNA methylation is maintained from parent to daughter cell by maintenance methyltransferases, in the case of mammals, the primary enzyme is DNMT1 or DNA Methyl Transferase 1. This enzyme recognises the hemimethylated DNA of a newly copied genome and methylates the unmethylated strand accordingly. Through this method of fully methylating hemi-methylated DNA according to the original strand DNA methylation patterns can be maintained throughout cell lines. At times of active remodeling of the epigenome the environment can is some instances modify the epigenetic marks, these periods are known as sensitive periods. We find these sensitive periods within the embryo with two major sensitive periods being defined. Firstly as epigenetic marks are removed and re-laid down through preimplantation and early implantation the embryo is more sensitive to external stimuli and also in primordial germ cell and gamete production the germ line of the embryo is sensitive.</p>
<p>Due to the sensitive nature of the epigenome within these periods it would be unwise to treat a patient, as any treatment could affect future generations (in males) or even a current fetus in females. Both epigenetic changes could also be present throughout the germ line.</p></div>
