    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the primary methods cells use to regulate gene expression. This is a far reaching process that is instrumental in everything from cell differentiation, to the imprinting of primordial germ cells which allow the discrimination between maternal and paternal alleles, and even in X chromosome inactivation.</p>
<p>Methylation is often synonymous with gene silencing. This is especially important when we consider promoter regions – these CpG dinucleotide rich regions (or CpG islands) are generally unmethylated, which allows for the nuclear machinery to switch on of off the gene as needed. Methylation of these regions locks them down and is difficult to reverse, but allows for long term regulation of a gene.</p>
<p>In the case of cancer however, many of these CpG islands become hypermethylated leading to a phenotype called CIMP. DNA methylation seems to accumulate during tumour progression, inactivating more promoters as the condition worsens. The result is an increasing number of genes that are no longer translated (including tumour suppressors and other regulatory proteins) which further contributes to the decline of the state of the cell, and a worsening of the cancer.</p>
<p>In the case of intergenic regions, the role of methylation is very different. In fact, a high level of methylation in these areas is an indicator of stability. These methyl groups are generally found at repetitive sequences. Methylation of these repetitive sequences prevents aberrant recombination and helps maintain genomic stability.</p>
<p>In cancer these methyl groups are often stripped away resulting in increased genomic instability, which in turn can cause aberrant gene expression and further contribute to the decline of the cell's organization.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>The imprint control region linked to lgf2 expression is paternally imprinted. This means it is normally methylated on the paternal allele. The methylation spreads onto the H19 CPG island promoter and prevents CTCF from binding. In this case downstream enhancers will act on the lgf2 gene and allow it to be expressed.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>The same ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele. This leads to CTCF binding at the ICR which in turn blocks the enhancers from acting on the igf2 region. The enhancers act instead on the H19 promoter and activate its transcription.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>lgf2 is an oncogene (stimulates growth), while H19 expression is linked to a tumor suppressor (Cdkn1c). Disrupting the balance of either expression leads to dysfunction in growth. In the case of the maternal allele being methylated at the ICR region, we see both an under-expression of H19 and an over-expression of igf2. This condition is known as Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome which is a condition showing fetal and post-natal overgrowth, macroglossia (large tongue), and predisposition to embryonic/childhood tumours, including Wilm's tumours which are often seen in the kidneys of these individuals.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Decitabine is a cytidine analog. It is classified as a demethylating agent because it functions by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases. Methyltransferases maintain DNA methylation by copying methyl groups onto DNA daughter strands during replication prior to cell division.</p>
<p>Once Decitabine has been incorporated into a DNA strand, it binds irreversibly to methyltransferase and prevents the daughter strand from being methylated. This can lead to tumour suppressor genes being reactivated in daughter cells.</p>
<p>Since heavy methylation of CPG islands is a strong indicator of cancer progression, preventing this maintenance of methylation improves the condition of daughter cells and can reduce the severity of the cancer. Since Decitabine affects cells that are dividing, its effects are naturally focused on cancerous cells which replicate and divide much faster than other cells in the body.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have long term effects on gene expression. If the methyl groups are located on promoter regions for example, or even on the tails of histones, the result is usually the silencing of the affected gene. The consequences for the cell can be significant, particularly if a silenced gene has a regulatory role in the expression of other genes.</p>
<p>There are several periods when an organism naturally undergoes a high level of epigenetic reprogramming – cell differentiation in the blastocyst stage of an embryo, x chromosome inactivation in female mammals,  and the development of primordial germ cells which are parentally imprinted.</p>
<p>During these periods, most epigenetic markers (including methyl groups) are stripped away and changed to suit the needs of the organism and a particular tissue type. Since there are so many epigenetic changes happening at the same time, the whole process is more susceptible to being disrupted.  Using an epigenetic cancer treatment on a pregnant female while the embryo is in one of these sensitive periods could lead to massive deregulation of the embryo's genome, and should not be administered.</p></div>
