    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is found to be widely altered in cancerous cells. CpG islands are normally unmethylated, however in cancer this pattern is disrupted in that CpG islands become hypermethylated. This extensive methylation causes abnormal gene silencing, which can include silencing of tumour suppression genes that normally act to suppress cell growth. Silencing of tumour suppression genes can lead to abnormal cell division and the occurrence of cancerous tumours.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, methylation normally occurs to silence these regions to reduce redundancy and errors in transcription. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements become abnormally unmethylated, or hypomethylated. This can lead to an increase in transcriptional noise and result in errors in transcription such as incorrect transcriptional start sites and antisense transcription.</p>
<p>These changes in methylation states in cancer both lead to irregular gene expression that can generate tumours and their related health problems, as well as allowing cancerous cells to grow, invade healthy tissue and spread in the body in metastasis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The disruption of imprint control regions can contribute to cancer by reducing the expression of growth restricting genes, and increasing the expression of growth promoting genes, through the expression or silencing of both parental allelles as an early stage of tumorigenesis. For example, in normal H19/lgf2, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allelle and umethylated on the maternal allelle. In the unmethylated maternal allelle, CTCF can bind to and insulate the ICR, allowing the enhancers then work on H19, and Igf2 is silent and not expressed on the maternal allelle. On the paternal allelle the methylated ICR is not insulated by CTCF, allowing the enhancers to work on Igf2 which is then expressed on the paternal allelle. With loss of imprinting, the maternal ICF is hypermethylated which leads to Igf2 expression on the maternal allelle as well as the paternal allelle. This leads to a double dose of the growth-promoting Igf2, which is associated with Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug currently on the market, which is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia, such as myelodysplastic syndromes. It works by demethylating hypermethylated DNA, which are methylated more than they should be and can result in the abnormal silencing of tumour-suppressor genes. In normal cells these genes should be active to stop cancerous uncontrolled cell growth. Demethylation of these genes can reactivate tumour-suppressor genes and slow the growth of tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the genome since epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. This means that epigenetic changes made in cells are passed on to all of the daughter cells and further generations of cells, beyond the period of drug treatment. However, using epigenetic drugs to treat patients in sensitive periods of development is inadvisable, since epigenetic marks are being established during this time. A sensitive period of development is one where epigenetic marks are being laid down in cells, such as in early embryonic development, the development of primordial germ cells and the maturation of germ cells in young people. Using epigenetic drugs on young people in sensitive periods can alter the normal establishment of epigenetic marks in their cells and cause these abnormal alterations to be passed down in their epigenome.</p></div>
