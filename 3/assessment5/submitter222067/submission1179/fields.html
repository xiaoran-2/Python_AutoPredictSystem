    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of CpG islands silences gene expression. In normal cells, most CpG islands are unmethylated. A small subset of CpG islands are methylated, depending on cell type. In cancer cells, CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated (more methylated than usual), thus silencing expression of these suppressor genes. Hypermethylation of CpG islands has similar consequences as genetic mutations and can be one hit to DNA that contributes to cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. The methylation contributes to maintaining genomic stability. Methylation of intergenic regions silences cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic spice sites. Methylation of repetitive elements sliences repeats to prevent transposition and transcriptional interference from strong promoters. It may also prevent illegitimate recombination. In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated (less methylated than usual). The consequence is genetic instability through activation of the sites and elements that are usually silenced. Less common than hypomethylation of repeats is hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters, which can lead to activation of genes that are usually inactive.</p>
<p>Furthermore, alterations to the methylation of imprint control regions (ICRs) are observed in cancer cell. Depending on the region, this may mean hyper- or hypomethylation. The result can be underexpression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations to the methylation of imprint control regions (ICRs) can result in underexpression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. For example, the imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated in normal cells on the paternal allele, while it is unmethylated on the maternal allele. The consequence is that Igf2 is only expressed from the paternal allele. In Wilm's tumor, the ICR is also methylated on the maternal allele, resulting in overexpression of the growth promoting gene Igf2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is an inhibitor that targets the enzymatic epigenic regulator DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). The effect of Decitabine is that DNMT is tighly bound once it attaches to the DNA and cannot move anymore along the DNA to copy the methylation over to the daughter DNA strand during cell division. The result is DNA demethylation, which leads to cell death. Because the inhibition works only in dividing cells and cancer cells divide at a much higher rate than normal cells, Decitabine effectively targets and kills tumor cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Once established, DNA methylation patterns are stable and get copied during cell division, so changes to the methylation pattern can have an enduring effect. Epigenetic marks need to be cleared between generations to restore totipotency. The reprogramming happens during what are called sensitive periods, which are primordial germ cell development and early development. Treating patients during such periods could have unknown, long lasting side effects and is thus inadvisable.</p></div>
