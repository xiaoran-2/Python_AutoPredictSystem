    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated, whereas normally the DNA methylation at CpG islands does not occur frequently. It is usually at a state of hypomethylation. This disruption in the CpG islands contributes to diseases such as colorectal cancer because the DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mututaion, to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer. At intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which normally is hypermethylated, becomes hypomethylated in cancer. The hypomethylation can result in activation of repeats and cryptic promotors and disrupt neighboring genes, which leads to genomic instability. The genomic instability promotes tumourigenecity. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, which means that decitabine removes methylation marks from DNA. This can allow for hypermethylation of the CpG islands which should be hypomethylated, to be decreased, therefore allowing activation of tumour suppressor genes to be transcribed more normally. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Due to epigenetic marks being mitotically heritable, the epigenetic changes can be passed on to daughter cells. Unlike gene regulation that involve transcription factors, the epigenetic marks, once placed with remain until actively erased. This allows for the enduring effects of DNA methylation on the epigenome. Sensitive periods for epigenetics is the developmental periods of cells which are most susceptible to changes. This occurs in two main periods during development, first is during early development of the gametes, around the time when they develop into blastocysts, the epigenome is wiped from the maternal and paternal alleles. The second is during the primodial germ cell stage when imprinting, paternal and maternal epigenomes are once again erased. Treatment during these periods is inadvisable because the cells would not be able to properly lay down the epigenetics that is normally required if it is disrupted. These periods are sensitive to changes in the environment as well as other factors. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The CTCF binding region on the maternal allel is unmethylated and methylated on the paternal allele. Since the maternal allele is unmethylated, this allows for CTCF, an insulator protein, to bind to the promoter. This insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. So on the maternal allele, Igf2 is not expressed but on the paternal allele, Igf2 is expressed. In Wilm's tumor the maternal allele is not methylated at the CTCF binding region which causes the overpression of Igf2. This disruption is caused by a transcript that is antisense to Igf2, known as Igf2-antisense, which is transcribed from within Igf2 in the reverse direction. This imprinting disruption causes increase in growth of the cells due to the fact that Igf2 is a growth factor gene. </p></div>
