    <div class="field-value"><p>*<span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span class="hps">CpG</span> <span class="hps">islands</span> <span class="hps">is usually the</span> <span class="hps">regulatory genes</span><span>, and</span> <span class="hps">are not</span> <span class="hps">methylated</span><span>.</span><span class="hps"> The level of expression</span> <span class="hps">of the</span> <span class="hps">gene</span> <span class="hps">is correlated</span> <span class="hps">with the amount of</span> <span class="hps">methylated</span> <span class="hps">DNA</span> <span class="hps">in the</span> <span class="hps">promoter sequence</span><span>.</span> <span class="hps">The</span> <span class="hps">degree of</span> <span class="hps">methylation</span> <span class="hps">is greater than</span> <span class="hps">the weaker</span> <span class="hps">expression</span> <span class="hps">of the</span> <span class="hps">gene.</span></span></p>
<p>* In cancer, cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span class="hps">Disorders of</span> <span class="hps">DNA</span> <span class="hps">methylation</span> <span class="hps">can lead to</span> <span class="hps">cell</span> <span class="hps">malignant transformation</span> <span class="hps">(e.g.,</span> <span class="hps">by excluding</span> <span class="hps">the expression of</span> <span class="hps">certain</span> <span class="hps">tumor suppressor genes</span><span>)</span></span></p>
<p>* Exluding the expression of tumor suppressor genes cause increase epression of tumor genes, which then causes <span class="short_text" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span class="hps">uncontrolled</span> <span class="hps">cell growth (oncogene activation)<br /></span></span></p>
<p>*Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. DNA methylation changes in repetitive elements  are associated with the regulation of gene transcription, embryonic development, differentiation and carcinogenesis. Functions: silencing of repeats to prevent transposition; mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposition; silencing of repeats, so avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters; methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination</p>
<p>* hypomethylation at intergenic regions/ repeats causes genomic instability (illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes)</p>
<p>*chromosomal instability and  depletion of DNA methylation appears to enhance tumorigenesis (causse cancer)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>* Paternal allele: DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter causes gene silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate</p>
<p>* Maternal allele: Igf2 is not active because of CTCF (it is an insulator protein), insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding.</p>
<p>* Upregulation of Igf2 (oncogene, growth promoting) cause tumour grown. It can be because: mutation/ deletion to cause loss of imprinting; uniparental disomy, two copies of one parental chromosome; epigenetic disruption for loss of imprinting (rare)</p>
<p>* overdose of Igf2 cause promotion of grow, tumor grow, so loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine is used in treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Decitabine is an anti-cancer ("antineoplastic" or "cytotoxic") chemotherapy drug and it is classified as an "antimetabolite", <span> It blocks cell growth (e.g. tumour growth) in the body. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>* Epigenetic changes like altering DNA methylation are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased they do not return. It might be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p>* Sensitive period (early development) -  it is generally believed that early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms.</p>
<p>* It is from birth (or before) to the time of essentially complete development of the brain, about age 6 or 7. </p>
<p>* Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it can cause changes that lead to decrease <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span class="hps">normal</span> <span class="hps">development of</span> <span class="hps">the child</span></span>.</p></div>
