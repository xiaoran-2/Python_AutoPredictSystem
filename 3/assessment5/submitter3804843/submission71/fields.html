    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, in general, CpG islands are hypomethylated whereas intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. The opposite landscape is found in cancer cells. In this case, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated while intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated.</p>
<p>The relevance of “CpG islands” in normal cells resides in the fact that a major proportion of them are located in promoters of tumor suppressor genes. In the normal state; i.e, hypomethylated, these promoters are accessible to the transcriptional machinery and subsequently they can be expressed. However, cancer cells depict a different pattern of methylation inside these CpG islands, they are hypermethylated, which is translated in gene silencing and therefore these tumor suppressor genes are inactive and the cells may undergo an unregulated proliferation (a hallmark of neoplasic processes). </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the majority of the genome is not made up of CpG islands but of “intergenic regions” or “repetitive elements”. In normal cells they are hypermethylated. In contrast, in cancer cells, these are found hypomethylated and this promotes genomic instability by several mechanisms: i) illegitimate recombination between repeats, ii) activation of repeats and transcription or iii) activation of criptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The maternal allele of normal cells presents the H19 gene unmethylated as well as the ICR (imprinted control region). In consequence, the CTCF insulator can be joined to the unmethylated ICR silencing the upstream Igf2 gene and enhancers can only activate the H19 transcription. In the paternal allele of normal cells, the H19 gene is methylated as well as the ICR and therefore the CTCF is not bind to the ICR, this one is free. The methylation of H19 inhibits its transcription and enhancers only activate Igf2. In summary; in normal cells, Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele and active for the paternal allele and for H19 vice versa, it will be active for the maternal allele and inactive for the paternal allele, i.e., for both genes, only one allele per cell will be expressed. In Wilm’s tumor, there is a hypermethylation of the ICR in the maternal allele disrupting imprinting. Subsequently, the maternal allele behaves identical to the paternal allele, both expressing Igf2. In consequence, the cell will present a double dose of Ifg2 expression whereas H19 will be completely silent.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an enzymatic regulator of the DNMTs (DNA methyltransferases) that acts as an inhibitor of these enzymes. It is a nucleoside analogue that irreversible binds DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, therefore replication-dependent (this important regarding side effects because tumoral cells replicate more than normal cells). This drug decreases the levels of DNA methylation. It may have an anti-tumor effect by decreasing the levels of DNA methylation that have been previously and abnormally increased as a consequence of a neoplasic process.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is not the single case where epigenetic abnormalities are found. Maybe, these drugs can be useful with other purposes or disorders where the epigenetic landscape is also altered and not yet detected.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those where epigenetic reprogramming occurs as for instance: early development and primordial germ cells development. Treating patients with “epigenetic drugs” during sensitive periods can be dangerous and therefore should be avoidable; i.e., childhood, especially in germ line of females can be harmful since oocytes remain in haploid de-methylated state until puberty and therefore epigenetic marks are not completely established. However, treating old patients with regard to long-term consequences is not so problematic.</p></div>
