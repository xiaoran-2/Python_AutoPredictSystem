    <div class="field-value"><p>Humans, like all mammals, have genome characterized by DNA sequences of approx. 1 kb with an increased number of CpG sites called CpG islands. Majority of these sites lack DNA methylation and are associated with promoters of all expressed genes - in many cases a tissue specific expression profile. In cancer there occurs usually an aberrant hypermethylation of CpG islands by DNAmethyltransferase. This hypermethylation usually occurs at CpG islands at promoters of tumour suppressor genes, resulting in transcriptional silencing, which is mitotically heritable. In some types of cancer hypermethylation occurs both in CpG islands with promoters and in orphan CpG islands (i.e. CpG islands without promoters). Regions of lower CpG density lying in approx. 2 kb proximity to CpG islands – so called CpG island shores - are also methylated which usually results in transcriptional inactivation. DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands silences gene promoters as majority of gene promoters are located at CpG islands. Among the gene promoters are the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. Many tumour suppressor genes are heavily methylated in cancer cells and subsequently decreased in their expression.</p>
<p>Methylation of intragenic regions and repetitive elements by DNAmethyltransferase plays important role in the regulation of gene expression and organization of chromatin within normal cells. Methylation has important role in gene imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation, but also in transcriptional silencing of repetitive elements, so they do not jump around causing displacements. In normal type cell the intragenic regions and repetitive elements are usually heavily methylated, which prevents genomic instability. In cancer cells there usually occurs a global DNA hypomethylation. Hypomethylation arises mainly from loss of methylation at normally heavily methylated repeats, including satellites and retrotransposons. This leads to genomic instability and oncogene activation, affects repetitive sequences, imprinted genes, tissue-specific genes, oncogenes, and genes associated with invasion and with metastases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genes IGF2/H19 are transcriptionally regulated by differentially methylated DNA domain (DMD) or imprinting control region (ICR) which is located upstream of H19 and downstream of IGF2. The DMD/ICR is methylated on the paternal allele but unmethylated on the maternal allele. A binding factor (CTCF) binds to the unmethylated ICR of the maternal allele, which blocks an enhancer region located downstream of H19 from activating transcription of IGF2 and activates instead transcription of H19. On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, which does not block the enhancer region from activating transcription of IGF2 so IGF2 is transcribed.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour the DMD/ICR is methylated on both paternal and maternal allele, which does not block the enhancer region from activating transcription of IGF2 so IGF2 is transcribed on both alleles. This aberrant methylation results thus in loss of imprinting. As IGF2 is growth promoting this process is associated with oncogene activation. Loss of imprinting is correlated with various types of cancers an occurs as a defect in methylation early in in Wilms tumorigenesis, i.e. in pre-neoplastic tissue. It is good to remember that in cancer cells there can be both hypomethylation in some imprinting control regions but hypomethylation in other regions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is described in The Economist as DNA-demethylating agent, i.e. DNAmethyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It is nucleoside analogue activated by phosphorylation (with deoxycytidine kinase) to triphosphate form. In its active form it binds irreversibly into DNAmethyltransferase (DNMT) during cell division, resulting in hypomethylation of DNA. In higher doses it is quite toxic as it inhibits DNA synthesis and induces cell death. Lower doses of DNMTis result in DNA hypomethylation and cause changes in the types of gene expression that cause differentiation and increase apoptosis. Because action of DNMTis is division dependent they affect more cancer cells which replicate more than normal cells. Lower doses of DNMTis are quite effective although mechanism of action is still not clear. It is possible that they are effective in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) because these diseases are dependent of CpG islands hypermethylation, which has generally poor prognosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic changes are genetically heritable, so the changes induced by epigenetic drugs can be permanent. It has been demonstrated that even highly aggressive cancer cells possess “plastic” phenotypes and can return to their respective differentiated, normal tissue phenotypes.   If one or more epigenetic drugs in combination can reverse cancer-associated, repressive epigenetic modifications produced during tumorigenesis, then cancer cells will be less resistant to chemotherapy as they would lose their embryonic cell like defense mechanisms against environmental insults (e.g. chemotherapy). One should though keep in mind that epigenetic changes induced by epigenetic drugs affect all cells, i.e. whole epigenetic machinery – not only cancer cells. Therefore one should keep in mind, that younger patients, especially those who are in the sensitive period of developing germ cells should be considered. The effective application of epigenetic drugs in the treatment of pediatric patients will require careful study of appropriate dosing and scheduling as well as a better understanding of their mechanisms of action and markers which can be predictive of response.</p></div>
