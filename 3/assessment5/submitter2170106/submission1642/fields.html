    <div class="field-value"><p>The function of DNA methylation is dependent on genomic and cellular context. In general, CpG islands (CGIs) located in the promoter regions of most genes are usually unmethylated in normal cells. DNA methylation at promoter CpG islands is associated with gene silencing. In cancer cells CpG islands are found to be hypermethylated resulting in the transcriptional inactivation of tumor suppressor genes that are involved in DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptosis. Additionally, CpG island shores, regions surrounding CpG islands within 2 kb, have been found to be hypermethylated in cancer cells. CpG island shore hypermethylation is also associated with gene silencing. Hypermethylation of DNA at CpG islands contribute to disease through inactivation of genes that control relevant cellular pathways that are critical for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.</p>
<p>On the other hand intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated. DNA methylation in these regions a mechanism to repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription, direct RNA splicing, prevent genomic instability, translocation and gene disruption. In cancer cells these regions are usually hypomethylated. Aberrant DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease by causing genome instability, double strand breaks, mutations and insertions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is controlled by DNA methylation and long non-coding RNA at the imprinting control regions (ICRs). Loss of imprinting through hypo- or hypermethylation can result in cancer and other diseases depending on the functions the genes. At the H19/IGF2 cluster, <em>H19</em> is expressed from the maternal allele and <em>IGF2</em> is expressed from the paternal allele. That is because these genes share enhancers and their reciprocal imprinting is governed by a CTCF-dependent insulator that is located between the genes. The ICR on paternal allele is hypermethylated. This allows <em>IGF2</em> to access the shared enhancer by preventing CTCF binding and subsequent <em>IGF2</em> expression. On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated allowing the CTCF to bind generating an insulator that blocks the <em>IGF2</em> from accessing the shared enhancer causing the expression of <em>H19</em> and silencing of <em>IGF2</em> in the maternal allele. </p>
<p>In Wilms’ tumor there is loss of imprinting of the <em>IGF2</em> gene (i.e. hypermethylation of both ICRs) that result in double dose of <em>IGF2</em> expression and silencing of <em>H19</em>. Disrupting imprinting (hypermethylation or hypomethylation) at the H19/IGF2 cluster contributes to disease by overexpression of growth promoting genes and loss of expression of growth restricting genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic alterations are reversible. Therefore targeting the epigenetic machinery such as DNA methyltransferases would reverse epigenetic abnormalities and restore the functions of various genes in several anticancer pathways. Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA demethylating agents called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. Decitabine is a cytidine analog that inhibits DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) activity by forming a covalent bond with DNMTs after the incorporation of decitabine into DNA. By this mechanism, decitabine irreversibly blocks DNMT catalytic sites for methylation. Decitabine can also trigger proteosomal degradation of DNMTs. The net effect of (lower-dose) decitabine treatment which is dependent on replication (cell division) is DNA demethylation.</p>
<p>The anti-tumor effect of decitibine treatment is due to its demethylating effect that leads to reexpresion of hypermethylated genes such as tumor suppressor genes and also inhibiting gene promoter DNA methylation. Tumor cells are severely affected by decitabine treatment as they are more rapidly replicating cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Treatment with epigenetic drugs can have enduring effects through cellular epigenetic reprogramming that can be mitotically hittable to daughter cells. This reprogramming also makes cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy and removes their stem-cell like phenotype.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of development when active remodeling and reprogramming of the epigenome takes place and are most sensitive to changes to the environment. Theses sensitive periods are (1) the period between pre-implantation development and early post-implantation, and (2) the period from primordial germ cell development to the production of mature eggs and sperms.</p>
<p>Changes in the environment or exposure to substances during these periods would result in disruptions of the active epigenetic remodeling. Other less sensitive periods are brief periods during adult development where specific organ or tissue develops. Therefore treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because treatment will alter the function of the epigenetic machinery responsible for epigenetic reprogramming leading to abnormal pattern and distribution of epigenetic modifications and alteration of the underlying genes. This not only results in disease to the exposed individual but also in the subsequent generations because of the possibility of transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic modifications.</p></div>
