    <div class="field-value"><p>In mammals, DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively at CpG dinucleotides. These dinucleotides clustered into CpG islands, often at promoters genes where transcription machinery binds.<br /><br />Methylation of CpG islands result in the silencing of gene expression by prohibiting the binding of transcription factor protein machinery at their promoters locations.<br /><br />Normally, CpG islands are unmethylated. However, in cancer, we can see an hypermethylation of these islands and island shores particularly at tumour suppressor genes. Consequently allowing cancer to proliferate.<br /><br />In contrast to the CpG islands, the intergenic regions (IR) and repetitive elements (RE) are usually methylated in normal cells. <br /><br />The methylation of IR allows to maintain genomic integrity by the silencing of cryptic splice sites, cryptic promoters sites or cryptic transcription start sites. Genomic instability that can results are abnormal deletions or insertions in chromosomes, duplications of whole chromosomes and reciprocal translocations between chromosomes. <br /><br />Transcriptional interferences can happen when these cryptic promoters aren't methylated. Their methylation inhibit their binding with RNA polymerase that interfere with the work of the proper promoter heading in opposite direction.<br /><br />The methylation of RE allows the silencing of repeats to prevent transposition. It also avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and may prevent illegitimate recombination by compaction of particular chromatin.<br /><br />In cancer, we observe a genome-wide hypomethylation at IR but most commonly at RE. <br />These repeats can become activate and make copy of themselves and transpose to regions where they can activate or disrupt the coding region of a gene. <br /><br />The inappropriate combination of hypo and hypermethylation as seeing in cancer are, indeed, source of genomic instability for the reasons mentionned above. <br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A common feature of cancer cells is their loss of imprinting. Genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression are become express or silent from both parental alleles.<br /><br />The loss of imprinting can lead to oncogene activation because lots of genes that are involved in imprinted are involved in either promoting or suppressing growth. Hypo or Hypermethylation of imprint control regions (ICRs) can consequently result in gene expression that, abnormally, decrease suppression or increase promotion of growth as seen in cancer cells.<br /><br />In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele ICR is normally methylated. This allows the enhancers to access and act on Igf2 expression, a growth promoting gene. <br /><br />In contrast, the maternal allele ICR is unmethylated in normal cells. This allows a CTCF protein to bind on the ICR and block the enhancers access to Igf2. The enhancers then fall back to express H19.<br /><br />In the Wilm's tumour, we see hypermethylation of imprint control regions. Both parental alleles are methylated. Enhancers on both alleles express Igf2 which result in its overexpression. <br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the bone marrow doesn't make enough normal blood cells. </p>
<p>Hypermethylation of some CpG islands are frequent in patients with MDS. [1]<br />This epigenetic alteration is reversible using decitabine.<br /><br />Decitabine is an FDA approved drug that belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA demethylating agents or DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). It get incorporated into the DNA and upon replication it bind irreversibly to DNMT1. This binding inhibit the DNMT1 enzyme which function is to copy the methylation onto the new daughter strands of DNA. <br /><br />As the tumour cells proliferate, they are then losing their hypermethylation through each cell division. Thus progressively stoping the tumour by restoring normal function to the tumour suppressor genes.<br /><br />Decitabine is also an antimetabolite that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that is passed on to daugther and granddaughter cells, thus can last beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>The epigenetic machinery ensure that DNA methylation are maintain throughout mitotic cell divisions.</p>
<p><br />However, there are sensitive periods when these epigenetic marks are more susceptible to the environment. Among these periods we have the time when active remodelling and epigenetic reprogramming occurs. At gametogenesis, after fertilization and in early development.<br /><br />By environment, we also include the host diet, stress factors (like maternal care) as well as exposure to chemicals and radiation...<br /><br />Human epidemiological studies on diet (Överkalix) has shown correlation between grandparental food supply and grandchild decrease longevity. These sensitive periodes are roughly 8-12 years in grandparents the fetal life in grandmothers.</p>
<p>Studies on paternal prepubertal smoking has shown effect in their sons health.<br /><br />All these facts leads us to be more cautious and forethought when treating patients during sentive periods since these treatments can potentially affect any cells in our system.<br />And with transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, we must think what effect a treatment will have on grandchildren if the patient is pregnant with a baby girl.</p></div>
