    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG Islands is to silence the gene that is downstream of the CpG Island.  In this manner genes are not expressed when they should be silent.    In cancer there is hypomethylation genome wide but there is increased methylation at CpG Islands that are the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes.   In Cancer CpG Islands are disrupted in two ways; CpG Islands that normally are not methylated are methylated. The genes that are downstream from the now methylated CpG Islands are not expressed.  The function of these now silent genes are protective against cancer by inactivating these genes the cancer can now occur without being repressed by the function of the silenced Genes.  The other mechanism is that CpG Islands that are normally methylated are not methylated.  This then leads to the expression of oncogenes that are normally suppressed.  The Normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions to maintain genomic stability.  When these regions are methylated then there is maintenance of the normal genome.  DNA repair occurs normally and the mitosis is occurs with normal karyotype transmission.  There are hypermethylations at ICR.  This can bee either hypo or hyper methylation.  This then results in the loss of growth restricting gene expression, and the over expression of growth promoting genes.  This also leads to loss of imprinting.  Hypomethylation of repeats and Intergenic Intervals leads to Genomic instability.  This genetic instability then leads to illegitimate recombination’s between the repeats with the activation of transpositions and with the disruption of neighboring genes.   The intergenic regions have lost their suppression activity of growth promoting genes, and as in the case of the genes that suppress Apoptosis they are over expressed. Pi RNA’s have a definite role in the loss of regulation of these intergenic regions. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  The administration of this agent removes the methylation that has led to the silencing of protective genes.  Decitabine acts as a methyl transferase inhibitor, this then prevents the methylation of CpG Islands that would down regulate protective genes.  The now unsuppressed genes are allowed to become active an then are able to suppress tumor growth.  Although hypomethylation is also a hallmark of cancer, particularly in the intergenic regions, This effect has not been enhanced by the use of this drug.  Thus the most significant anti-tumor effect is to curtailed unrestricted cellular division and reproduction by allowing the naturally occurring suppressors gens to then become active again.  This agent has been used in solid tumors, and is considered to be useful when combined with standard chemotherapies.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>That epigenetic drugs altered the tumor cells in a lasting manner can be explained by the fact that the demethylation at the CpG Islands unlocked the tumor suppression genes that had been blocked by the hyper methylation seen in Cancer.  This was a lasting effect when The cells divided and there was a return to more normal tumor gene suppression.  That this was not a tumor cidal effect in solid tumor cancers can be explained by the fact that this effect allowed tumor growth suppression which then slowed the growth of tumors, and then the addition of cidal drugs that could kill existing tumor cells were more effective.  A Sensitive period is when normally suppressed genes are being suppressed by methylation.  This occurs during the blastocyst stage and during gamete primordial production.  It is also present during cellular differentiation at varies stages of embryogenesis.  These drugs should be avoided in women who are pregnant or who may be pregnant, they should also be avoided in men who wish to become fathers.  If these drugs were used in these patients they could affect imprinting of the gametes, deactivation of the X chromosome and interfere with cellular differentiation and Apoptosis. &lt;!--?xml:namespace prefix = "o" ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /--&gt;</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele there is methylation of the H19 ICR this leads to the blocking of the growth restricting genes and Igf2 is expressed on the Paternal allele.  In the Maternal allele there is no methylation of the H19 ICR and this leads to expression of the enhancers and CTCF binds to ICR1 and a chromatin boundary is established and Igf2 is insulated from the enhancers.  (epigenetics Allis p 442) .  In Wilm's Tumor there is methylation of both the maternal and paternal H19 ICR and this leads to the over expression of the Igf2 ( Insulin growth factor 2).   This occurs because the Igf2 gene is influenced by the enhancers from both the maternal and the paternal Allele. </p>
<p>This disruption fo the imprinting at the H19/igf2 cluster leads to disease by the over expression of Igf2 when both parental allele are suppressed at the H19 locus in that cas ICR1 is not blocked by STCF in either case.  Igf2 is then over expressed.  If there is a deficit of methylation of the parental allele at H19 then both ICR1 locus will be blocked by CTCF and there will be an under expression of Igf2.  This could lead to a disease state where there is stunting of normal cellular growth factors. </p></div>
