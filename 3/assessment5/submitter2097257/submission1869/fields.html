    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration of DNA methylation patterns is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Broadly speaking, in cancer the global DNA methlyation goes down (particularly in intergenic regions and repetitive elements) while in selected CpG islands the DNA methylation goes up.</p>
<p>In normal cells, there is very little DNA methlyation at CpG islands, allowing for the normal expression of tumor suppressing genes, among others. However, cancerous cells typically have locus specific hypermethlyation at CpG islands, leading to silencing of tumor suppressor genes. While the identities of these targeted CpG islands varies by cancer/tumor type, it seems to be a common feature across many types of cancer. Because of the mitotic heritability of DNA methylation, these epigenetic ‘insults’ (silencing of tumor suppressors) can provide one of the ‘hits’ of the Knudson hypothesis (which states that cancer is the result of multiple disruptive hits to the DNA).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in normal non-cancerous cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements (repeats) have relatively high level of DNA methylation. According to the “genome defense model”, this DNA methylation protects the genome from transposable elements, and overall functions to maintain genomic stability. In cancer, intergenic regions and repeats become hypomethlyated, leading to genomic instability. These deleterious destabilizing effects include illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and their transposition, the activation of cryptic promoters, as well as other deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations. Furthermore, the hypomethlyation of CpG poor promoters in intergenic regions can lead to oncogene activation.</p>
<p>Thus, we see that alterations of DNA methlyation patterns in cancer can lead to both silencing of tumor suppressors and oncogene activation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting leads to cancer in many ways. Here we consider as an example the H19/Igf2 cluster and Wilm’s tumor. The ICR in the H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted, meaning the ICR for the paternal allele is methylated, but not on the maternal allele. As a result of the paternal ICR methlyation, the CTCF insulator protein cannot bind to the ICR, and there is nothing to prevent downstream enhancers from activating Igf2 gene expression. In addition, methlyation spreads to the nearby CpG island containing the H19 promoter, thus silencing it. Meanwhile, on the maternal allele, the absence of ICR methlyation allows CTCF to bind, and thus insulates the Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers (and sending them to H19 instead). Thus in normal cells the paternal allele has active Igf2, which acts as a growth promoter (oncogene), whereas the maternal allele has silenced Igf2. </p>
<p>Wilm’s tumor arises in children with Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), which is an imprinted disorder associated with the H19/Igf2 cluster and the nearby Kcnq1 cluster. In BWS, the maternal allele acts like a paternal allele, resulting in a loss of Cdkn1c (a tumor suppressor) and the upregulation of Igf2 (an oncogene). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cancer treatment drug in the class of epigenetic regulators called DNA demethylating agents. Thus it acts as a hypomethylator : decreasing the DNA methlyation. It does this by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1), a primary DNA methylation promoter. Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, as well as acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). These are diseases of the blood involving the myeloid blood cells. Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect by decreasing the methylation of certain gene loci involved in healthy blood cell function or tumor suppressor genes, and thus activating those genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Economist article describes Dr. Baylin’s research into treating advanced lung cancer using a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine. Many patients experienced a slowing of tumor growth. Furthermore, some patients who did not show direct benefit from the treatment went on to exhibit a better reaction to conventional chemotherapy. Dr. Baylin postulated that the alteration of DNA methlyation patterns by the drugs led to lasting changes, including greater susceptibility to chemotherapy. This is plausible because of the mitotic heritability of DNA methlyation, meaning changes in the methylation pattern will be passed down to daughters cells during cell division, until the epigenetic marks are actively erased. This erasure typically happens during pre-implantation or primordial germ cell (PGC) development. These are known as “sensitive periods”, i.e. periods when the epigenome is particularly sensitive to environmental effects. There may be additional sensitive periods, such as in female children, whose oocytes are still developing and laying down marks. Treating patients during sensitive periods is not advised because many epigenetic marks are being set and epigenetic drugs may have widespread effects on the epigenome.</p></div>
