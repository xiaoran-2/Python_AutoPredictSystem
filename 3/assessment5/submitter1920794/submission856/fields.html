    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (that is a DNA demethylating agent).</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue and becomes incorporated into DNA during replication. The incorporated Decitiabine is then irreversibly bound by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). This causes DNA methylation levels to decrease.</p>
<p>The effect of Decitabine is most severe in rapidly replicating cells, such as tumour cells. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect as the decrease in methylation levels lead to the demethylation of the CpG Islands in the promotors of Tumour suppressor genes. This restores the normal function of tumour suppressor genes (increases their expression) and enables them to restore control over cell growth. This in turn slows tumour growth. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If CpG islands in the promotors of genes are methylated they usually result in the silencing of that gene (except for those dynamically methylated).</p>
<p>In normal cells CpG islands are hypomethylated. In cancer cells CpG Islands are hypermethylated, which can result in the silencing of tumour suppessor genes. Sometimes there is hypermethylation of a single gene eg. RB in retinoblastoma, or there can even be hypermethylation of a set of genes (CIMP). Which CPG islands are methylated varies by tumour type.</p>
<p>Cancer is proposed to be the result of a number of mutations or 'hits' to DNA. DNA methylation can be one of the 'hits' that contributes to cancer development. Methylation of CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes results in silencing of their expression, reducing the ability of the cell to control its growth.  Methylation is mitotically heritable, so the effect is passed on as cells replicate.</p>
<p> DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements functions to maintan genomnic integrity and genomic stability. In intragenic regions the methylation silences cryptic splice sites and prevents transcriptional interference from cryptic transcription start sites. Methylation of repetitive elements silences transcriptional interference, prevents transposition and may prevent illigitimate recombination from occuring as methylation leads to compaction of the chromatin.</p>
<p>In cancer there is genome wide hypomethylation, with the intergenic regions and repetitive elements being hypomethylated. The hypomethylation of these regions leads to genomic instability. Cryptic promotors can become active disrupting other genes' expression. Repetitive elements can be activated and can jump around the genome. Hypomethylation leads to a more open chromatin structure which can allow illigitimate recombinations between chromosomes. These changes are all mutagenic and can result in deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, duplications or losses of chromosomes,which in turn disrupt gene expression. These changes are found in cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methlyation is heritable, that is it is maintained through cell division such that the subsequent cell generations have the same DNA methylation pattern as the original cell. If you make changes to DNA methylation through treatment with a drug, those changes will be passed onto to future generations of cells in the absence of the original drug. </p>
<p>A sensitive period is a time in development where an altered environment can have an affect on epigenetic control. During sensitive periods there is active remodelling or reprogramming of the epigenome. </p>
<p>In mammals there are two main sensitive periods, early development (from fertilization of the egg to epiblast formation) and primordial germ cell development. </p>
<p>It would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods, as this could significantly effect the laying down or resetting of normal epigentic marks. The germ cells of younger patients are particularly vulnerable. As epigentic marks are mitotically heritable the epigenome changes would remain in the germ cells of that individual and could contribute to disease in the the next generation. DNA methylation is the basis for epigenetic phenomena such as X-chromosome inactivation, imprinting and the formation of heterochromatin. Disrupting these epigenetic phenomena would have mutagenic effects and could lead to imprinting disorders, cancer, etc.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele's imprinting control region(ICR) is normally methylated. This prevents CTCF and its cofactors from binding and together with methylation of the H19 promotor, allows down stream enhancers to access Igf2 and enhance its expression.</p>
<p>The maternal allele's  imprinting control region(ICR) is normally unmethylated. This allows CTCF and its cofactors to bind the ICR where they act as an insulator, preventing the down stream enhancers from accessing Igf2. The enhancers are unable to enhance Igf2 expression. The enhancers activate H19 expression instead.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour imprinting is disrupted as both the maternal and paternal ICRs are hypermethylated. This results in the downstream enhancers being able to access both the maternal and paternal Igf2 alleles, instead of the paternal allele only. This results in a doubling of the expression of Igf2. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene and the doubling of its' expression levels contribute to the growth of a Wilm's tumour (childhood kidney cancer).</p></div>
