    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands, or cytosine and guanine promoter regions, can be methelated to stop the attachment of transcription factors and subsequent expression of genes. In some cells, these regions are often hypermethelated, leading to inappropriate transcriptional silencing. This silencing can often envelop nearby genes, some of which code for tumor suppressors both genetic and epigenetic in nature. When these are silenced, growth can continue unchecked, leading to the formation of tumors. In contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements experience hypomethelation. These regions are often methylated for the purposes of genomic stability, as they can contain cryptic promoters and other factors in illegitimate recombination, deletion, insertion, and replication. Stability is also maintained by the packaging (by way of methylation) of some chromatin into heterochromatin, which cannot interact enough to perform the above processes. Therefore, hypomethylation of said regions can lead to the detrimental activation of said promoters and unpackaging of chromatin, causing detrimental chromatin interaction. Of course, methylation of different genes has variegated effects, both because of the location of methylation (such as methylation of H3K4 vs H3K27)  and the role of the methylated gene (which can be an oncogene or a tumor suppressor affecting any part of the body), but generally speaking, hypermethylation of CpG islands and hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements can contribute to the development of cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At a normal H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele contains a methylated insulator and methylated H19. The former prevents the binding of CTCF, which blocks transcription of Igf2, and the later prevents transcription of H19. Therefore, a normal paternal allele transcibes Igf2 but <em>not</em> H19. In contrast, CTCF in the maternal allele binds to an unmethylated insulator, preventing transcription of Igf2, and unmethylated H19 is transcribed. In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele is methylated in the same manner as the paternal, leading to overproduction of Igf2 and underproduction of H19. Because Igf2 is a growth factor and H19 is (commonly believed to be) a tumor suppressor, these two factors often lead to inappropriate cell growth and replication, particularly in the kidneys. This example demonstrates how in many cases, overproduction of oncogenes and underproduction of tumor suppressors due to disruption of imprinting and replication of one allele pattern can lead to various types of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, marketed as Dacogen, is now being used as a treatment for cancer. As a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, it binds to and inhibits DNMTs (DNA methyltransferases), decreasing methylation. Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, a precursor to AML, a form of leukemia. It is replication-dependent, giving it a differential effect on rapidly dividing (i.e.- cancer) cells when given in small doses. The reason it primarily effects myelodysplastic syndrome is unknown, although its demethylating properties suggest that it is because myelodysplastic syndrome is caused by hypermethylation at CpG islands and subsequent overpromotion of potentially harmful genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, and inconclusive studies in Overkalix and Holland (following its famine of 1944) imply that some epigenetic patterns may be meiotically heritable as well, either through incomplete erasure during sensitive periods or through the existence of messengers during embryonic development. As a result, changes to DNA methylation could quickly lead to widespread changes in the epigenome of the patient, and possibly those of said patient's children and grandchildren. Sensitive periods are points in development during which the epigenome is particularly vulnerable and methylation is mostly cleared. The two most significant sensitive periods are the time during which the blastocyst is developed preimplantation, in which the entire genome is briefly cleared of epigenetic marks, and the late stage of embryonic development during which gametogenesis takes place. Additionally, germ cell development during preteen years is highly sensitive. Alterations to DNA methylation made during these times could spread quickly through the genome and disrupt the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks, leading to imprinting disorders and genomic instability. Therefore, these treatments would be inadvisable for young patients whose germ cells are still in development and pregnant women whose unborn children are in sensitive stages of development.</p></div>
