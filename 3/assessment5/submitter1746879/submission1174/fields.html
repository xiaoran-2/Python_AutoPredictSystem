    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>DNA methylation is essential for normal development and number of key processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, suppression of repetitive elements, and carcinogenesis. CpG island methylation plays an important role in epigenetic gene control during mammalian development and is frequently altered in disease situations such as cancer. The role of DNA methylation in the control of mammalian gene expression has been the subject of intensive research in recent years, partly due to the critical role of CpG island methylation in the inactivation of tumour suppressor genes during the development of cancer.</li>
<li>Cellular pathway is disrupted by promoter CpG island hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes. The putative role of epigenetic disruption in producing the aberrant patterns of expression of miRNAs in cancer cells is still not clear. The miRNA expression patterns can be developmentally regulated, tissue-specific or steadily expressed in the whole organism and are thought to play important roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation.</li>
<li>Most DNA methylation is essential for normal development, and it plays a very important role in a number of key processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and suppression of repetitive element transcription and transposition and, when dysregulated, contributes to diseases like cancer. During tumorigenesis, human cancer cells underwents a progressive gain of promoter CpG-island hypermethylation and a loss of CpG methylation in non-CpG-island promoters contributing to disease.</li>
<li>In healthy cells, CpG dinucleotides of lower densities are found within coding and non-coding intergenic regions. Parasitic repetitive sequences, centromeres and oncogenes are often repressed through methylation.</li>
<li>Cancer cells exhibit dense hypermethylation of up to 10% of CpG islands as well as hypomethylation of bulk chromatin including intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</li>
<li>DNA methylation patterns in human cancer cells are considerably distorted. Cancer cells exhibit hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements that normally comprise the majority of a cell's methyl-cytosine content. Consequently, transposable elements may become active and contribute to the genomic instability observed in cancer cells.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>In most tissues IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele while H19 is expressed from the maternal allele. The only specific methylation changes that occurred in tumors with relaxation of IGF2 imprinting were solely restricted to the maternal IGF2 and H19 alleles. Which suggest that there has been an acquisition of a paternal epigenotype in these tumors as the result of a pathologic disruption in the normal imprinting of the IGF2 and H19 genes.</li>
<li>Sequence outside of the differentially methylated domain (DMD) can attract some paternal-allele-specific CpG methylation 5′ of H19 in preimplantation embryos, although this methylation is not maintained during postimplantation in the absence of the (DMD). The (DMD) is required to maintain repression of the maternal Igf2 allele and the full activity of the paternal Igf2 allele in neonatal liver.</li>
<li>In Wilms tumors, the relaxation of IGF2 imprinting in Wilms tumors also involved a concomitant reversal in the patterns of DNA methylation of the maternally inherited IGF2 and H19 alleles. Which suggest that there has been an acquisition of a paternal epigenotype in these tumors as the result of a pathologic disruption in the normal imprinting of the IGF2 and H19 genes.</li>
<li>Acquisition of a paternal epigenotype results in a pathologic disruption in the normal imprinting of the IGF2 and H19 genes.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor</li>
<li>The DNA methyltransferase (DNA MTase) family of enzymes catalyze the transfer of a methyl group to DNA. DNA methylation serves a wide variety of biological functions. All the known DNA methyltransferases use S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor.</li>
<li>Reversal of promoter DNA hypermethylation and associated gene silencing is an attractive cancer therapy approach. The DNA methylation inhibitor like decitabine are efficacious for hematological neoplasms at lower, less toxic, doses. These effects are accompanied by sustained decreases in genomewide promoter DNA methylation, gene reexpression, and antitumor changes in key cellular regulatory pathways. Low-dose decitabine and azacitidine may have broad applicability for cancer management.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>For example: EZH2. This  enzyme  attaches methyl  groups to  histone  proteins, w hich  are  part  of  the  chromosomal  packaging. A  lot  of  lymphomas (cancers  of  the  immune  sy stem) are  caused  by  mutations  that make EZH2  overactive.  Such overactivity  methylates  histones more  than  they   should  be  and  thus  silences  the  genes  they surround,  including  so-called  tumour-suppressor  genes whose  job  is  to  stop  the  uncontrolled cell  grow th  that  causes  cancer. Epigenetic  changes  are  passed  on  during  cell  division  to  daughter cells  unti l  they   are  actively   erased. Once erased, they   do not return. I t might  therefore  be  that  epigenetic  therapies  can  effect  changes which  stop a cancer grow ing w i thout  having  to  ki ll  all  i ts  cells..</li>
<li>A period in which there is need for new revolutionary medical discovery for treatment of incurable diseases.</li>
<li>Attempts for developing new drugs or medicines for the treatment of incurable diseases.</li>
<li>Due to the unavailability of specific medical drug for the complete treatment of patients,  treating patients during sensitive periods is not advisable,</li>
