    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with silencing of gene expression. In cancer there is more methylation of CpG islands, which means that some genes are silenced in contexts where they are normally active. Tumor suppressor genes normally act to inhibit cancer. If tumor suppressor genes are silenced by increased DNA methylation of CpG islands, then this can contribute to cancer proliferation. </p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps protect against genomic instability. In cancer there is less methylation in intergenic regions. This can lead to genomic instability. For example, repeat regions will no longer be methylated and heterochromatinized. This allows the repeats from different chromosomes to pair up and recombine, leading to translocations, deletions and insertions. In addition, reduced methylation can lead to mobilization of transposon elements which create more genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is normally methylated on the paternal allele. This prevents CTCF from binding to the ICR. The enhancer elements can therefore acccess the Igf2 promoter and lead to Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>The ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is normally unmethylated on the maternal allele. This allows CTCF to bind to the ICR. CTCF blocks the enhancrs from accessing the Igf2 promoter, so Igf2 is not expressed. Instead, the enhancers promote H19 expression from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele. This is because the ICR is methylated, preventing binding of CTCF. The enhancers therefore can access the Igf2 promoter on both the maternal and the paternal allele. Because of this there is a greater amount of Igf2 produced, which acts to stimulate tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It reduces the amount of DNA methylation by blocking the activity of DNA methyltransferases. In tumor cells, the CpG islands in tumor suppressor genes are often methylated so that these genes are silenced. If DNA methylation is inhibited then the tumor suppressor genes can be reactivated and inhibit tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of methyl groups to CpG dinucleotides. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, which means that if you inhibit DNA methylation in one cells, its daughter cells will also have less DNA methylation. In this way drugs that disrupt DNA methylation can have effects that last for longer than the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period when the epigenome is more sensitive to disruption. This is because sensitive periods coincide with periods of epigenetic reprogramming - the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. These periods include germ cell development and early embryonic development. </p>
<p>If you treat a pregnant woman you could also affect embryonic development in her child. If you treat a young girl you might also affect germ cell development, as this continues after birth in females.</p></div>
