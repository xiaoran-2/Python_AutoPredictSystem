    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of the cytosine base within the CpG dinucleotide is the main epigenetic modification of the DNA in mammals. Normal methylation is disrupted in cancer mainly by two different mechanisms: global hypomethylation and specific hypermethylation of the CpG island promoters of tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Most of the human genome is CpG depleted. However, this dinucleotide can be found at close to its expected frequency in small genomic regions (200 bp to a few kb) known as CpG islands. These areas are usually ‘protected’ from methylation and are located in the proximal promoter regions of 60% of the genes. The methylation of a promoter region of a gene usually means its inactivation. In normal cells, CpG islands are unmethylated so the gene can remain active. However, during a tumorigenic process, the CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes (among others) are methylated. These epigenetic changes inactivate the genes and allow the cancer cell to acquire advantageous capabilities like for example avoiding apoptosis or unlimited replicative potential.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation in cancer can affect two different genomic regions: a vast majority of the genome formed by repetitive elements and intergenic regions and a minor one associated with CpG islands of silenced genes being the latter related to transcriptional activation of genes silenced during development and differentiation. The former one is the main cause of genomic instability. When unmethylated, repetitive elements alter genomic structure in different ways. Firstly, they can cause gene disruption when a repetitive element transpose into its sequence and eliminate its function. Secondly, the can transpose in the nearby of cryptic promoters and affect the expression of near genes. Finally, the repetitive element became hot spots for recombination due to its repetitive nature and major structural effects like insertions, deletions and translocation occur giving place to abnormal karyotypes with severe outcomes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor  and  one of the epigenetic drugs approved by the FDA. It is a DNA nucleoside analog which means that can be incorporated during replication. Once in the DNA, it binds irreversibly the DNMT1 protein when it comes to methylate the daughter strand. This dependence for replication confers this drug some certain specificity for cancer cells due to their high replication rate although effects on normal cells are expected (the use of low doses has improved its anti-neoplastic action and reduced the non specific toxicity). The main effect of this drug is the progressive demethylation of the genome. In some sorts of cancers where their main cause is the hypermethylation, like in the Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),  this drug can provide a mechanism to restore a more orderly DNA methylation profile which result in a much better prognosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>mprinting refers to conditioning of the maternal and paternal genomes during gametogenesis, such that a specific parental allele is more abundantly (or exclusively) expressed in the offspring. One example of imprinting is the H19/Igf2 cluster. Between the Igf2 gene and the lncRNA H19 there is  a CTCF binding region. When this region is unmethylated, as in the maternal allele, a CTCF protein can bind to it and insulate Igf2 gene from enhancers located downstream that will act upon H19. On the other hand, when this region is methylated, as in the paternal allele, CTCF protein cannot bind and the methylation spreads to the H19 silencing it. In this case, the enhancers will not act on H19 but on Igf2 gene instead. On common feature of cancer cells is that they display  loss of imprinting meaning that instead of a monoallelic expression they have expression of both alleles or none of them. In Wilm´s tumour, a hypermethylaton of the ICR (Imprinting control region) is produced so the CTCF protein cannot bind and the maternal allele behaves as the paternal. As Igf2 gene is a growth promoter gene, or oncogene, this overdose is a cause for the abnormal growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One important trait, yet in discussion, of an epigenetic mark is its mitotically heritability.  DNA methylation is one mark which has been observed to be maintained from the mother cell to its daughters. This maintenance is produced during the cell division by DNMT1 which takes an hemi-methylated DNA and fully methylates it.  However, if we treat some cells with a drug that inhibits or alters this process enough time, the daughter cells will receive an abnormal methylation profile that will be continued even when the drug is not there anymore. They will transmit this new methylation pattern to the next cell generations.</p>
<p>For this possible lasting effects and due to the non-targeted effect of this drugs it is important to avoid drug treatment in certain periods. These sensitive periods are those where the epigenetic landscape is established like in the early development or during the primordial germs cells development. This means epigenetic drug treatment during pregnancy or childhood, where germs cells are still being matured, should be avoided. If we treat patients during this periods we can alter irreversibly the cells that will give rise to the whole organism and cause major disturbances.</p></div>
