    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression.  In cancer, we find genome-wide hypomethylation (including at repetitive regions, CpG poor promoters, and imprint control regions), but also locus specific hypermethylation (such as at CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes and at particular imprint control regions).  If the CpG islands near promoters of tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated, they will be silenced, so their tumour suppressing function will be inactivated.  If the CpG islands near the promoters of oncogenes (for example, growth promoting genes such as Igf2) are hypomethylated, they will not be silenced, so the affected cells will get a higher dose of growth promoting gene products.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity (to reduce deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, recombinations) and to silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites.  Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is typical in cancer.  Given the hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, we can anticipate that exactly the kinds of problems methylation prevents will occur (deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, transcriptional interference, recombination).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele's methylation pattern is to have a methylated imprint control region (ICR) and methylated H19 promoter.  The methylated ICR prevents the CTCF insulator protein from binding, which means Igf2 is not insulated from the downstream enhancers and its expression will be enhanced.  The maternal allele's methylation pattern is to have an unmethylated ICR and unmethylated H19 promoter.  CTCF binds to the unmethylated ICR, which insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers, reducing its expression.  In Wilm's tumour, there is hypermethylation of the ICR, so both alleles have a methylation pattern like the normal parental allele, and therefore there is overexpression of Igf2.  If imprinting is disrupted and both alleles have methylated ICRs, both alleles will express Igf2.  Igf2 is a growth-promoting oncogene, and of course unregulated growth can lead to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, specifically a DNMT inhibitor.  This means that decitabine reduces DNA methylation, and as a DNMTi that reduction is division dependent.  If a tumour is caused by tumour suppressor hypermethylation, reducing DNA methylation can suppress tumorigenesis.  Division dependent DNA demethylation is convenient for cancer because cancer cells divide rapidly.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is maintained through mitosis by DNMT1 except during sensitive periods, so if DNA methylation is altered, that alteration will be maintained in daughter cells.  A sensitive period is a period in which there is epigenetic reprogramming occurring, meaning that DNA methylation is being removed and re-established.  The sensitive periods are embryogenesis (early development) and gametogenesis (primordial germ cell development).  It would be inadvisable to treat patients with DNA methylation altering drugs during sensitive periods, because as the name suggests, these are periods in which DNA methylation is much more easily influenced and there might be highly influential unintended consequences of the treatment.</p></div>
