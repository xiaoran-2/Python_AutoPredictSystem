    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancerous cells express hypermethylation of CpG islands, silencing the expression of underlying genes, which would otherwise contribute to cell control (e.g. prohibiting the proliferation) or repair of the genome. On the other hand, some parts of the genome are hypomethylathed, causing removal of the imprinted marks, causing the cancerous cells to have more plasticity and also shifting a balance of the internal cell environment towards a setting with higher concentration of proliferation promoting proteins, and also unpacking the chromosome, which event is necessary for cell division to occur.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, paternal Igf2 and maternal H19 are being expressed. In a cancerous cell, maternal chromosome is se to the methylation state of the paternal, i.e. both have active lgf2 region, after which there is a methylation that disables expression of H19. Lgf2 behaves as a promoter of a cell growth with H19 being it's antagonist. In Wilm's tumor, not only the inhibition of the cell growth is removed, but the proliferation signal is even strengthened.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine binds to methyltransferases, causing them to lose their function and resulting in hypomethylation, i.e. Decitabine is a hypomethylation agent. This drug then slows down tumorogenesis by partially blocking production of several transcription factors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation may be mitoticaly heritable, which means that during development periods, a cell that suits as a predecessor for many others will cause them to also have the same epigenetic setting. This setting than lasts until specifically removed, which may mean for the lifetime. During sensitive periods - development between zygote and blastocyst and during development of germ cells of an organism (since the later development it utero until puberty), in which periods the marks are being mainly set. Insensitive setting of these marks would have a life-time disabling effect with possible epigenetical heritability.</p></div>
