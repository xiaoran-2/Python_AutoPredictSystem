    <div class="field-value"><p> For the expression of the gene, the CpG islands are ususally unmethylated; conversely, methylation of the CpG island prevents the expression of a phenotype.  Thus, methylation of the CpG island is an alternative to genetic mutation, but ,unlike DNA mutation, epigenetic modificaton is reversible.  From material presented in class, the CpG islands are surrounded by CpG shores having a length of about 2 kb and are apparently the sites at which methylation occurs.</p>
<p>The CpG islands occur near the start code for transcription start sites in genes. (1)  This indicates that disruption of DNA methylation is associated with the placental development and mid-gestation embryo, i.e. times at which active cell division is occurring as well as times at which cell differentiation is occurring.  The normal functioning of DNA methylation would silence the functioning of genes leading to abnormal growths.  </p>
<p>The CpG shores are positioned ingenetically and are the agents which are more important in the silenceing of genes than are the CpG islands.(1)  Without the methylation of islands and shores, the genes would normally be silenced are not.  If these islands and shores are methylated during the process of transcription, then the methylation of the shores would be produced in the transcribed DNA. </p>
<p>Changes in teh epigenome could result an architectural rearragement of the DNA and histones within the cell nucleus.  Changes in the "...nuclear architecture or loss of boundaries..." (2) may lock in an altered epigenome.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>

        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (Dacogen) or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine is a hypomethylating agent used in the treatment of  myelodysplsatic syndromes.  It functions in a manner to azacitidine (1).  Dacogen acts by dethylation or by interfering with the methylation of DNA (2) and is thought to be an anti-metabolite (3).  Through either of these mechanisms, the normal function is restored to the tumor suppressor genes. ( 3,4)  Accordingly, decitabine has an affect upon abnormal cell growth and allows for the better production of  "...red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets." (4)</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In “Cancer’s epicenter” in April 7, 2012 edition of The Economist,  Stephen Bayling speculated that tumors, which were treated epigenetically, responded more  favorably when subjected to traditional chemotherapy.  The principal reason for this assertion seems to be associated with the claim that epigenetic modification can alter transcriptions throughout the lifespan, that epigenetic modifications are reversible, and that they can be pased on throgh cell division.  Essentially, the sensitive period would be the time during which active cell division is occurring and during which epigenetic changes are being erased.  This would occur predominantly during   The sensistive period would be that time during which there is extensive cell division and growth - placental growth and embryo development.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 is methylated in the paternal allele, but is unmethylated in the maternal allele.  In the maternal allele, H19 operates in the direction towards the enhances and does not activated Igf2 as Igf2 is blocked by CTCF.  In the patenal allele, the enhancers are able to activiate Igf2 due to the methylation of the H19  Accordingly, only the maternal H19 is expressed in the normal cell, while the paternal allele expresses Igf2.    </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the ICR is not screened by CTCF and hte H19 is methylated in the maternal allele. The action of the enhancers in the maternal allele serves to activate Igf2, which is silenced during normal functioning of the maternal allele.  This loss of imprinting in the ICR results in the loss of expression of growth restricting genes and causes an overexpresson of growth promoting genes.
