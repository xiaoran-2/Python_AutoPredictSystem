    <h1>Submission 1980 from Anon (session_user_id: c50c1b520080d2ee6336f6f6e3e9562d3ab2406f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine its a <span>DNA-demethylating agent or hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methytransferase, in other words,<span> is a drug that inhibits DNA methylation. "DNA methylation<span> is a b</span>iochemical<span> process involving the addition of a methyl group</span><span> to the c</span>ytosine<span> or a</span>denine<span> DNA n</span>ucleotides".</span></span></p>
<p>DNA methylation is also an important regulator of gene transcription and a large body of evidence has demonstrated that genes with high levels of 5-methylcytosine in their promoter region are transcriptionally silent. </p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Aberrant DNA methylation patterns - hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue-have been associated with a large number of human malignancies. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. Decitabine may have an anti-tumour effect because if " acts by inhibiting DNA methytransferase" genes like the tumour supressor gene are like to be more active(less methylated) and then effective against tumour supression.</span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells the level of methylation at CpG islands is very low in contrast with the high DNA methylation observed in cancer cells. CpG islands are usually unmethylated.</p>
<p><span>"Cytosines in CpG dinucleotides can be m</span>ethylated<span> to form 5</span>-methylcytosine<span>. Methylating</span><span> the cytosine within a gene can turn the gene off. <span>Methylation of CpG sites within the promoters of genes can lead to their s</span>ilencing<span>.like the case of the tumour supressor gene. In contrast, the hypomethylation of CpG sites has been associated with the over-expression of o</span>ncogenes<span> within cancer cells"</span></span></p>
<p> Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. About the DNA methylation on intergenic regions and repetitive elements, scientists thinks its there probably for genomic integrity. Because Dnmt1 null cells display genomic instability in the case of intergenic regions.</p>
<p>What happens in the case of cancer this intergenic regions and repetitive elements now tend to be unmethylated and this mean as a whole in the genome we now see hypomethylation. Was also found that in particular situations CpG islands are hypermethylated, this is they are methylated when they shouldn´t be. It´s known that in cancer we tend to see genomic instability like deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations. The hypomethylation at the intergenic intervals and repetitive elements helps to bring it back that genomic instability in the case of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the context of cancer, they display loss of imprinting, in other words genes that should be displaying  parent of origin specific expression in other words they are imprinted no longer show this imprinted expression but rather their become either expressed from both parent alleles or silenced from both parental alleles. And the reason this is found in cancer is probably because lots of genes that are imprinted are involved in growth.</p>
<p>The imprinted control region , ICR, its methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. In this last case(maternal), because is unmethylated CTCF will allow enchancers to act  on H19. However lgf2 will be silent so we dont see expression.In the case of paternal allele, because ICR is methylated the enchancers will now acts directly on lgf2.</p>
<p>However with loss of imprinting we now see hypermethylation of both ICR  ,maternal and paternal, and expression of lgf2 on both maternal and paternal sides.This leads to a double dose of lfg2 wich is a growth promoting leading then to Wilm’s tumour  where there is and Igf2 overexpression</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span> "Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return."</span>A sensitive period is a period in which the developing brain has heightened sensitivity to environmental influences. These sensitive periods represent the plasticity of the brain to external influences. Sensitive periods of development can be divided in 3 groups:-Period of dividing zygote,implantation and bilaminar embryo, Main Embryonic Period and Fetal Period.</p>
<p>Its inadvisable treating patients during sensistive periods because at a "molecular level"  it could have secondary effects on generations to come. Like its inadvisable a pregnant mother taking drugs or a father smoke because of infertility.Because a certain drug could help treating some disorded but we dont know about secondary effects or any resulting mutations like cancer orother disorders that can be "passed on" to generations</p></div>
