    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypomethylation of the genome is a hallmark of every type of cancer ever studied. In healthy cells, DNA methylation at CpG islands may result in gene silencing or activation. 70-80% of CpG islands in healthy mammalian cells are typically methylated, regardless of their activity state.  In cancer, this percentage increases, leading to genomic instability, for example deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions and duplications of chromosomes. CpG island hypermethylation also results in deregulation of tissue-specific and imprinted genes.  CpG island 'shores' are also hypermethylated in cancer, silencing gene promoters. Tumours accumulate higher levels of DNA methylation as they progress. </p>
<p>CpG islands are found at promoters of genes, where transcription factors would bind if the gene were active. Therefore methylation at CpG islands tends to lead to silencing of gene expression. This is how healthy cells use methylation to silence promoters at the start of repetitive elements, so that they aren't able to transpose themselves. In cancer, this process is disrupted and intergenomic regions and repeats are hypomethylated, resulting in DNA damage and instability, as repetitive elements are mutagenic. </p>
<p>The increased DNA methylation at CpG-rich sites is known as CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP). CIMP results in silencing of tumour suppressor genes, and is associated with a range of tumour types including colorectal, glioma and breast cancers. Mutations to methyltransferases are common in many different tumour types, eg EZH2 in prostate and breast cancers, and DNMT3a in acute myeloid leukaemia. Histone modification patterns are very dynamic and variable, contributing to tumour heterogeneity and either promoting or restricting tumour proliferation.</p>
<p>Loss of repressive heterochromatin leads to decrease in repressive histone marks. Can lead to de novo gene silencing in cancerous cells. Many genes are silenced in cancer, giving it a stem cell-like signature</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Around 150 imprinted genes have been identified in the human genome. Each cluster has its own Imprint Control Region (ICR), also known as Differentially Methylated Regions, and their methylation pattern determines both their action (either silencing or activating their target cluster of genes) and their origin (either paternally or maternally imprinted). Mutations or deletions can lead to loss of imprinting, a common feature of cancer.</p>
<p>Igf2 is an oncogene, therefore overexpression results in fetal and postnatal overgrowth and predisposition to Wilm's tumour, a childhood cancer of the kidney. On the maternal allele, the H19 promoter (a reservoir for microRNA) is unmethylated and downstream enhancers are free to activate the H19 gene. On the paternal allele, H19 is methylated. The downstream enhancers now cannot bind to H19, so instead activate the Igf2 gene. Therefore Igf2 is only expressed from the paternal allele in a healthy cell. "Heterochromatin spreading" is responsible for the silencing of H19 on the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Loss of or mutation to the maternal allele, causing it to behave like a paternal allele, (e.g. uniparental disomy, when two copies of chromosome 11 are inherited from the father), lead to this overexpression of Igf2, or Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome. This condition can only be passed on maternally, as it is damage to the maternal allele that results in disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor class of epigenetic drugs. These drugs are nucleoside analogues that irreversibly bind DNMT after they are incorporated into DNA. DNMT facilitates the methylation of DNA by adding methyl groups to the lysine or arginine 'tails' of histones that protrude from the nucleosome. </p>
<p>In small doses, Decitabine and similar drugs can have antineoplastic effects by causing DNA demethylation. Therefore they are most effective in tumors that depend on hypermethylation, and as they are replication dependent for their action, they firstly target the cancerous cells that are replicating at accelerated rates. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are mitotically heritable, therefore epigenetic drugs that alter cells' epigenetic marks may have lasting effects as these are passed on to daughter cells, potentially for decades in somatic cells. DNA methylation controls activation and silencing of genes, and also contributes to genomic stability, explaining the long-lasting potential effects of any drugs that alter a very stable epigenetic mark such as DNA methylation.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are times when epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are erased and reprogrammed, during primordial germ cell development, gametogenesis, and pre-implantation, and the early post-implantation period. Specific organs may also have their own sensitive periods of tissue differentiation. Disruption to sensitive periods, such as potentially taking an epigenetic drug, may result in epigenetic marks not being reset therefore it would be potentially very inadvisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during these periods. </p>
