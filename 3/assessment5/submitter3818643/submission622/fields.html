    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a healthy cell CpG islands are not methylated, so if they are in the promotor of a gene, this gene is not silenced. However in cancer cells the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. If the methylation takes place at the promotor of a tumor suppressor gene this gene can be epigenetically silenced and thus cancer can grow. DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, so it is an alternative to a genetic mutation which is another possible way of silencing a tumor suppressor gene. The methylation of CpG islands gets more and more the more time goes by. In intergenic regions and repetitive elements there is hypermethylation in a normal cell. This has the effect that these regions are epigenetically silenced. In cancer cells something different happens: here the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This lack of methylation leads to genomic instability. In particular this means that recombination might occur between repeats, that repeats are activated in cancer cells or that cryptic promotors are acitvated and neighbouring genes are disturbed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A lot of cancer cells show a loss of imprinting. Imprinted genes often influence growth. The imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele. Because the ICR is methylated no insulator can bind on the ICR and the enhancers can act on Igf2 and Igf2 is expressed from the parental allele. However in the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and CTCF can bind to the ICR. CTCF is an insulator element and if it binds the enhancers act on H19 and Igf2 is silenced from the maternal allele. In Wilm's Tumor there is hypermethylation if the ICR on the maternal allele as well as on the paternal allele. Thus the disruption of imprinting leads to a double dose of Igf2, because it is expressed both from the maternal and the paternal allele. Since Igf2 is growth promoting this leads to Wilm's Tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine inhibits the DNA Methyltransferade (DNMT), so it belongs to the class of DNMTi (DNA Methyltransferase inhibitors). Only during the process of DNA replication Decitabine, which is a nucleoside analogue and thus embedded in the DNA, can act as a DNMTi. When the DNMT arrives to copy the methylation to the daugther strand from these particular nucleotides it is bound irreversible to the DNA and can no longer copy methylation during replication. The effect of Decitabine depends on cell division because DNMT only acts during replication. Since cancer cell divide much faster than healthy cells, they are more often affected and thus it might be possible to stop the growth of a tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically inherited, so if you change the DNA methylation pattern in one cell all her daughter cells will have the same changes. A sensitive period is a period in the development of an organism in which the epigenetic marks are reprogrammed. One senitive period is during early development in the pre-implantation period, so before a zygote becomes a blastocyst. The other sensitive period is during primordial germ cell development. Drugs that change something in the epigenetic machinery are dangerous during reprogramming of epigenetic marks because these drugs affect every cell in a body and are a huge insult to the environment.</p>
