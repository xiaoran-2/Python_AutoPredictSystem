    <div class="field-value"><p>  'DNA methylation' is the addition of a methyl group (CH<sub>3</sub>) to the fifth carbon on a cytosine base in CpG nucleotides in a DNA sequence,  one of many epigenetic marks that the body uses to direct chromatin structure, which in turn directs cell-type and what genes and proteins will be expressed.  The more methylated a DNA sequence is, the more tightly bound the area, and the less accessible to transcription molecules such as RNA polymerase, silencing genes, and in the case of X-inactivation, a whole chromosome.</p>
<p>  In a normal cell, 'DNA methylation' is found throughout the chromosome strands, at genes, and especially at intergenic regions  and repetitive sites.  This promotes genetic integrity by discouraging transcription factors from starting in the middle of a gene or at a cryptic transcription start or splice site, and may prevent faulty recombination of chromosomes.  Methylation also allows for a neat structural packaging of chromosomes at metaphase, allowing for easier and exact mitotic division.</p>
<p>  In a normal cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated.  The resulting accessibility of these CpG islands, which are located upstream of genes, acts as a beacon for transcription factor binding, so that the factors then transcribe the downstream gene.  In this way the CpG islands direct the expression of genes.</p>
<p> In disease, and cancer, everything is reversed:</p>
<p>there is hypomethylation at intergenic and repetitive regions, causing genetic instability: chromosome deletions, reciprocal translations, and insertions, facilitating genetic diseases and cancers;</p>
<p>there is hypermethylation at CpG islands, causing the silencing of perhaps a tumor suppressor gene, a DNA repair gene, or a gene controlling growth, whose lack of expression could cause disease such as cystic fibrosis, or cancer.   The earliest epigenetic aberration found in cancer was a genome-wide lack of methylation at CpG islands.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation is permanent: once knocked out, mitotic division passes on that removal,*making cancer cells that were previously immune to cancer treatment, now potentially vulnerable.  The removal of epigenetic markers may be immediate, but the effects upon disease of chemotherapy treatment in combination with epigenetic treatment  may take longer to manifest, as chemotherapy might only be effective once DNA methylation barriers have been epigenetically removed.</p>
<p> Altering DNA methylation could potentially reactivate a silenced gene, such as a tumor suppressor, offering us a tantalysing glimpse at a possible a cure. (Instead of radioactive seeds, imagine 'tea-bag' of  timed-release epigenetic drug sown to tumor excision site?)</p>
<p>*DNMT1 only maintains methylation, it takes DNMT3a &amp; b to lay down initial <em>de novo</em> methylation, which happens in 'sensitive periods': preimplant/early postimplantation, and primordial germ cell development to mature gamete, when all or some epigenetic marks are cleared and reset. Thus it's unadvisable to treat a pregnant person, fetus, even an adolescent or child  with epigenetic drugs, as in these sensitive periods when epigenetic markers have been partially or completely wiped clean, epigenetic drugs could play havoc with reprogramming of somatic marks and the laying down of germ cell chromatin. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (sold as Dacogen) is a hypomethylating agent,or DNA methylation inhibitor, meaninng that it blocks or removes DNA methylation by attacking methyltransferases (DNMTs) that begin (DNMT3a &amp; B) or maintain (DNMT1)DNA methylation. It's chemical formula is <span>5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine, and it's</span> used in treating diseases of myeloid  blood cells: <span>myelodysplastic syndromes and myelogenous leukaemia</span>. Once methylation is removed as an epigenetic mark, it does not return.Since abnormal DNA methylation can silence expression of tumour suppressor genes, as well as genes that control growth, removing the unwanted methylation can transform the mutated cells, allowing the cells to resume normal gene expression, and  potentially removing the invincibility and/or the unchecked proliferation of tumour cells, so that they can be better targeted by chemotherapy or radiation treatments. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> <em>Igf2 </em>is both paternally imprinted, because its imprint control center is methylated, and paternally expressed. Expression of<em> Ifg2 </em>is dependent upon downstream enhancers, who, when a free pathway is available, will act upon the upstream <em>Igf2, </em>activating it<em>.</em> In the paternal gene, the imprint control center is methylated, and that methylation spreads to what would have been the gene for <em>H19</em> protein, but the methylation silences it, allowing the enhancers a clear path back upstream to activate <em>Igf2</em>: paternal expression.  On the maternal gene, the imprint control region is unmethylated, allowing the CTCF insulator protein to bind with it, blocking the enhancers' pathway back to the <em>Igf2</em>.  As a second choice, the maternal enhancers act upon the <em>H19 </em>promotor<em> </em>gene, (which is downstream of the CTCF bound imprint control center),  enhancing and causing the <em>H19</em> long noncoding RNA protein to be maternally expressed.</p>
<p>  <em>Igf2 </em>expresses insulin-like growth factor 2, important to body growth and development. In Wilm's tumor, imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted.  <em>Igf2 </em>is over-expressed because the paternal ICR is hypermethylated, or the maternal chromosome has reverted to the paternal epigenotype, increasing or doubling expression of growth promoting factors, causing Wilm's tumor. </p></div>
