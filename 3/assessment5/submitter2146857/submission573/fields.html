<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>DNA methylation is the incorporation of a methyl group in  cytosines of DNA that regulates  different processes. It has  dual characteristic.  </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>On one hand methylation of  cytosines withing CpG island in promoters silences the corresponding gene while  when the islands are  not methylated the regulated gene is active. In cancer occurs a hypermethylation of CpG island inducing the silencing of many genes that normally are expressed. Among them tumor suppressor genes whose silencing induces the generation of the tumor</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>On the other hand in intergenic regions and repetitive regions in normal cells there is a generalized methylation of cytosines   that prevents activity of retrotransposons, abnormal recombination, abnormal segregation of chromosomes and other processess. In cancer there is a genome wide hypomethylation of cytosines that   correlates with the severity of the tumor. Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements   generates the chromosome instability that is one of the  hallmarks of cancer.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>                       </p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Disruption of imprinting can either imply the overexpression of a gene or the silencing of a gene depending on the ICR. both things can lead to cancer depending on the nature of the gene</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>In the next paragraphs I will describe the example of the H19/Igf3 cluster.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>In the maternal allele of this cluster the absence of methlylation at the insulator allows  binding of CTCF that in turn does not allow enhancers to act over the distant Igf2.  As a  consequence of this process   Igf2 is silenced.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>On the contrary in the paternal allele the insulator region is methylated  preventing  the binding of CTCF, in turn allowing  the action of the distant enhancers, and in consequence Igf2 is expressed</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>In Wilms tumor there is methylation of the insulator in the maternal allele that normally is unmethylated, in consequence maternal allele of Igf2 is expressed leading to a double dose of this growth promoter gene, thus cancer. </span></span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent . Thus it demethylates metil-cythosines. It can have an antitumoral effect if the tumor was a consecuence of the hypermethylation of a CpG island that silenced a tumor supressor gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dna methylation is mantained through mitosis, so once established a pattern with a drug, the pattern will still be there when the drug is not around anymore.</p>
<p>A sensitive period are those that has great impact on development. On these periods epigenetics marcs are established or reprogrammed, including imprinting marcs.  They are ; diferentiation of gamets, and post-fertilization period.</p>
<p>It is inadvisable to treat patients during this period cause the consecuences would be a generalized disorganization of epigenetics marks in the gametes, or the developing embryo. This can have serious disruptives consequences, even intergeneration ones. </p></div>
