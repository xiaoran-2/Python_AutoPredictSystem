    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression.  Once methylated, proteins like MeCP2 can bind to the CpG islands.  These transcriptional repressors work to condense the chromatin, reducing/silencing gene expression.  DNA methylation is can also silence gene expression by directly blocking transcriptional factors from binding to the CpG islands. </p>
<p>In patients with cancer, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, as opposed to their wild-type unmethylated state.  Hypermethylation causes genomic instability, which can lead to mutations such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.  In addition, hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumor suppressors can prevent normal means of keeping uncontrolled cell growth ("cancer") in check.  This is especially true as cancer is believed to be an attack to one's DNA.  Hypermethylation at promoters of more than one tumor suppressor can  be part of those attacks. </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated.  This is to help maintain genomic stability and keep the genome "normal," preventing the gain/loss of chromosomes.  By methylating these elements, they are silenced to help prevent transcriptional interference, illegitimate recombinations and mutations.  Intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated in all cancers (the unmethylation of repeats is most important with respect to cancers, as it is rare most anywhere else). </p>
<p>Hypomethylation decreases genomic stability, as the DNA is not in the closed heterochromatin, but rather the more open euchromatin. This allows lengthy repeats between non-homologous chromosomes to align and recombine, causing aberrational reciprocal translocations.  As euchromatin, hypomethylated repeats could be activated, copied and even jump around (transpose) the genome.  They may also have their promoters activated, or even activate neighboring genes.  These instabilities are characteristic of many types of cancers, as they can include other mutations such as deletions or insertions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The disruption of imprinting can lead to cancer.  In the example stated in week 4/6 video lectures, in normal cells, the paternal allele of Igf2 is expressed while the maternal allele is silenced.  The paternal allele is methylated at the ICR, which spreads to H19 (silencing it).  The methylation prevents the insulator CTCF from binding to the ICR.  This allows enhancers found downstream to act on the Igf2 gene, causing its expressions.</p>
<p>In the normal cell maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind to it.  This insulates the Igf2 gene from the effects of the downstream enhancers, causing them to act on H19, leading to expression of H19 and silencing of Igf2.</p>
<p>In patients with Wilm’s tumor, there is hypermethylation of the ICR in both maternal and paternal alleles.  This prevents CTCF from binding, allowing downstream enhancers to act on the Igf2 gene.  This leads to a double dose of Igf2 since both alleles are expressed.  Since Igf2 is a growth promoter, the double dose can not only increase genomic instability, but can also lead to increased cellular growth and ultimately tumor formation, as is the thought with Wilm’s tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have effects on the epigenome, and altering it can bring about long-lasting effects.  First off, epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation are mitotically heritable, meaning they are passed from one generation of cells to the next generation of daughter cells.  Therefore, altering DNA methylation for one set of cells is not necessarily a temporary change, since future daughter cells will possess those changes.</p>
<p>There are periods of development when I would avoid treating patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation.  Changing the DNA methylation in an organism's cells during "sensitive periods" can lead to lifetime-long effects.  These sensitive periods occur during early embryonic development and during primordial germ cell development.  These are called sensitive periods because they are times of genomic instability, meaning that changes to epigenetic marks can occur.  It is during sensitive periods that epigenetic marks are being established rather than being maintained.  Changes that happen during these critical times can be passed onto the next generation of cells.  </p>
<p>It is for this reason that I would not treat patients during sensitive periods.  For example, DNA demethylation occurs during these sensitive periods, and altering this (say, by preventing the demethylation) could have disastrous effects as this is essential for cell function.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is in the DNA-demethylating class of epigenetic drugs that target enzymatic epigenetic regulators.</p>
<p>This category of drug can have a direct impact on DNA methylation, as they remove methylation marks in regions that may be cancerous from hypermethylation of CpG islands.  Decitabine contains nucleoside analogs, meaning they get incorporated into the DNA upon replication.  When DNMT1 comes to bind to the nucleotide to copy methylation to the daughter strand, it is irreversibly bound.  Resulting methylation will be incomplete/decrease as cells continue to replicate.  These drugs are division dependent, meaning replication must be occurring in order to target cells.  As cancer is a disease of uncontrolled cell growth/division, these cells may be more severely affected by these drugs.</p>
<p>By targeting and removing methylation marks, Decitabine can have anti-tumor effects as there is the potential to restore the "normal" unmethylated state to the promoter regions of tumor suppressors.  This can increase gene expression, resulting in regulation of tumor cell growth. </p></div>
