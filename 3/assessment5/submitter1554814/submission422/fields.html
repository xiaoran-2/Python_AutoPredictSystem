    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG Islands are long stretches of cytosine and guanine (connected by a phosphate) of 200 to 500 base pairs.  CpG Islands are found near gene promotors:  when unmethylated, the gene is expressed, but when methylated, the gene is inhbitied.  These CpG Islands help regulate gene expression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands are found to be hypermethylated, thereby inhibiting gene expression, especially the gene expression of tumor suppression genes.  By disrupting the cells normal gene expression by hypermethylating CpG Islands, the cell becomes abnormal.  While not all abnormal cells become cancerous, some will.  As mentioned, if tumor suppression genes are inhibited, the cell can become tumourous. Another example is the disruption in Imprinting Control Regions (ICR) resulting in Wilm's Tumor.  Here the hypermethylation of the an ICR results in overexpression of the normally supressed maternial growth factor gene.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, the genome is typically methylated, but in cancer cells, these regions become hypomethylated, just the opposite of the CpG Islands.  It is important that these regions stay methylated, so the chromatin stay compressed as heterochromatin and thereby minimizing gene translocation.  When cancer disrupts the methylation in these regions, they open up as euchromatin and translocations, an exchange of material from one chromosome to another, can happen with a much greater frequency.  These translocations cause over and under expression of genes in a random, and therefore, abnormal way.  Some of these random ways can, for example, lead to overexpression of growth genes and underexpression of tumor suppression genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf cluster is a very interesting example of gene interaction, imprinting, enhancers, insulators, and methylation.  The gene sequence in both the maternal and paternal alleles is the same:  Igf2 -&gt; ICR -&gt; H19 -&gt; Enhancers.  To control the amount of Igf2, growth factor, the paternal allele has its ICR and H19 methylated, while the maternal allele is not.  Now, typically we say that methylation suppresses gene expression, but here the situtation is a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the unmethylated ICR allows the insulator, CTCF, to bind to it.  This ICR/CTCF complex stops the enhancer genes from reaching upstream to the Igf2 so Igf2 is not expressed.  The enhancers instead act on H19, a long non-coding RNA which serves as a reservoir for micro-RNA.  On the paternal allele, there is no insulator, so the enhancers reach the Igf2 and Igf2 is expressed.  This is because, due to a mechanism called chromitin looping, Igf2 is the preferred area for the enhancer genes to work, rather than H19.</p>
<p>In a Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele exhibits the same methyation as the paternal allele on the ICR and H19.  As a result, no insulator can bind the ICR, and  Igf2 is expressed at twice that rate it should be expressed which leads to the Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug made by Eisai of Japan which acts to de-methylate DNA.  In cancer, CpG Islands are hypermethylated resulting in the suppression of genes, especially tumor suppression genes.  Decitabine works to demethylate the CpG Islands which can, in turn, allow tumor suppression genes to be re-expressed.  De-methylation drugs have been found to work in some Leukaemias.  However, cancer works in many ways, and demethylation might not always be the best strategy.  While CpG Islands are hypermethylated, the rest of the genome is hypomethylated.  Decitabine can exasperate the problems caused by hypomethylation of the rest of the genome, so knowing exactly what caused the cancer is essential for determining treatment.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have a more enduring effect on the epigenome than standard chemotherapy because DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable.  So by changing the methylation of one cell, that change can be passed down to all its daughter cells.  </p>
<p>There are periods in development when the epigenetic marks on the genome are wipped clean and reset.  These periods are know as sensitive periods, because any disturbance to the epigenetic marks are then mitotically inheritable and passed down to all subsequent cells.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sensitive periods include the time of epigenetic reprogramming when the epigenetic markers are cleared in the fertilzed egg, where they reach a low at the blastocyst, and are reprogramed in the epiblast.  Another sensitive period is the development of the primordial germ cells that give rise to the gametes.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you treat a patient with drugs like Decitabine, which de-methylate the DNA, during these sensitive period, the normal epigentic markers will not be properly set, not only in the treated cells, but because methylation is mitotocially inheritable, in all the daughter cells as well.</p></div>
