    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often found at the promotor of genes. If these islands are methylated the gene downstream of the promotor is silenced. In cancer CpG islands are often hypermethylated. For different cancer types different CIMPs (CpG island methylator phenotypes) were discovered. If the genes downstream of the hypermethylated CpG islands are tumor supressor genes, this hypermethylation, and therefore gene silencing, contributes to disease. </p>
<p>The methylation of integenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to the maintenance of the genomic integrity:</p>
<p>Due to the silencing of repeats their transposition is prevented. Furthermore transcriptional interference caused by strong promoters is inhibited by this silencing. Finally the methylation of repeats prevents illegitimate recombination. In cancer the intergenic regions and repeats are hypomethylated. This leads to genomic instability and its consequences (described above).   </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally the imrinting control region(ICR) of the paternal allel as well as the CpG island in the promotor region of H19 are methylated.Due to this the insulator CTCF can not bind to the ICR. This results in an Igf2 expression caused by the enhancers dowmstream the H19 gene. On the maternal allel the ICR and the CpG island are not methylated. Because of this the CTCF can bind and therefore prevent the enhancer function on the IgF2 gene and the H19 gene is expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm`s tumour both alleles have methylated ICRs and CpG islands. As a result of that both alleles express Igf2.</p>
<p>This redoubled Igf2 ammount contributes to disease because it`s associated with growth promotion.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). It is a nucleosid analoga which is incorporated into the DNA (during replication). When the DNMT enzyme binds to it, this binding is irreversible. As a result of that, the DNMT can no more methylate the DNA. This leads to a DNA hypomethylation. In order to reach this effect the DNMTi should be used in a very low dose.</p>
<p>The anti tumour effect is caused by the anti-neoplastic effect related to the DNA hypomethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering the DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome because they are passed on during cell division to their progeny cells.</p>
<p>A sensitive period means a period where the cell`s epigenome is defined. During this time, the epigenetic modification process is susceptible to disruption (due to enviroment or epigenetic modifying agents).  The early embryonal developmental phase (pre-implantation) and the premordial germ cells developmental phase are such sensitive phases.</p>
<p>During this phase a treatment with epigenome altering drugs could lead to a disruption of imprinting or general mistakes in epigenetic modifications. The consequences of this are quit heterogeneous but could be lethal. Beacause epigenetics are involved in nearly every cell process and have also an influence on the genetics. </p></div>
