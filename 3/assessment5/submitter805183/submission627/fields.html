    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA is methylated at 5th carbon atom of cytosine, predominantly in CG pairs. Parts of DNA enriched in such pairs are called CpG islands and are found predominantly at promoters. Usually, CpG islands are not methylated irrespective of gene activity, but highly methylated CpG islands in most cases indicate that the gene is silenced.</p>
<p>In cancer CpG islands in promoters of tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated, which means tumor suppressors are silenced and cannot suppress tumor growth. Hypermethylated state becomes more pronounced as ilness progresses. The same happens with aging poining that DNA hypermethylation may be involved in higher cancer occurance in aged people.</p>
<p>Different cancers differ in the pattern of CpG islands hypermethylation, each type featuring some characteristic CpG islands beenig hypermethylated. Examples include promoters of MLH1 in colorectal cancer or BRCA1 in breast cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Normally, DNA is hypermethylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Hypermethylation of inergenic regions ensures genome stability by favouring dense chromatin packaging (heterochromatin formation). Hypermethylation of repeats serves for silencing of repeats (to prevent transposition and transcriptional interference), for prevention of illegitimate recombination and for induction of mutation from CG to TG (this reduces repeats similarity and lowers probability of transposition).</p>
<p>In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, which means all of the above functions are affected. This leads to genome instability (i.e. deletions, insertions, duplications and reciprocal translocations) as well as to transposone activation (i.e. jumping which can lead to gene disruption). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each cancer features both hyper- and hypomethylation, but for different cancers only one of them is the most important. In tumors driven by chromosomal instability drugs leading to increase of methylation would suppress ilness. In contrast, in tumors driven by tumor suppressor hypermethylation it would only make things worse.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>H19/Igf2 cluster is structured as follows. Upstream of ICR is Igf2 gene, downstream of ICR is H19 gene. Further downstream are enhancers that can bind either to Igf2 promoter (preferably) or to H19 promoter (if Igf2 is inaccessible). Igf2 codes for growth factor, while transcription of H19 lncRNA suppresses growth. In maternal chromosome ICR is non-methylated and CTCF protein binds to it. This leads to screening of Igf2 promoter so the enhancers activate H19 rather than Igf2. In paternal chromosome ICR is methylated so CTCF cannot bind to it, therefore enhancers activate Igf2. Furthermore, due to methylation spreading promoter of H19 is also methylated, so H19 is not expressed. </span></p>
<p><span>In summary: Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele, H19 — from the maternal. Right balance in the activities of these two genes is required for normal cell function. If Igf2 activity outweighs that of H19 this leads to disbalanced growth (oncogene activity outweighs growth suppressor activity). That is what happens in </span>Wilm's tumor.</p>
<p>Possible causes of such disbalance:</p>
<p>1) the maternal allele is not imprinted correctly and behaves as if paternal (due to mutations, especially deletions);</p>
<p>2) uniparental disomy (paternal in this case);</p>
<p>3) disruption in epigenetic machinery, e.g. mutations in CTCF leading to its inability to bind to ICR. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. </span>It is a cytidine analog wich can be included in the DNA chain. When included, it binds to DNMT so that cell becomes DNMT-deficient which in turn leads to decreased DNA methylation. Since decitabine must be incorporated into DNA for its action, its action is replication-dependent. </p>
<p>Antitumor effect of decitabine is observed in myelodisplastic syndromes and in acute myeloid leukemia, which are tumors driven by hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. So, DNA hypomethylation provides help in this situation (as described in answer to Q1).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation profile is conserved throughout human life due to DNMT1 activity. After DNA replication newly synthesised strand isn't methylated so the resulting DNA is hemimethylated. Such DNA is recognised by DNMT1 which adds methyl groups to daughter DNA strand thus providing mitotical heritability of DNA methylation. That is why drugs aletring DNA methylation state influence all future cell generations and their effect lasts beyond the period of treatment.</p>
<p>There are two exceptions from this rule — the two sensitive periods at which global epigenetic reprogramming occurs. These periods include early embryonic development (up to gastrulation stage) and germ cells formation. Each tissue has also its own periods of reprograming, but these two are the main sensitive periods when the fate of all cells is affected. During sensitive periods most of DNA methylation marks are removed and then are added de novo. Impairment of this process leads to different developmental abnormalities, sometimes even lethal. That is why <span>treating patients during sensitive periods (i.e. young people with differentiating germ cells) would be inadvisable.</span></p></div>
