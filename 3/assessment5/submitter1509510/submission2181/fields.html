    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are clusters of cytosine and guanine bases most often found at the promoters of genes. In normal tissues these CpG islands are most often unmethylated, leaving the gene in an active state. Only a small amount will be (transiently) methylated, inducing silencing of a specific subset of genes, making differentiation during development possible. In cancer however we see a large amount of hypermethylation in CpG islands and CpG island shores. Using this mechanism tumours are capable of silencing specific tumour suppressor genes, for example BRCA1, RB and MLH. This may be one of the hits proposed in the Knudson hypothesis. Besides this CpG hypermethylation, cancers are characterized by an overall, genome wide hypomethylation. In healthy tissues intergenic regions and repeats display a methylated state, silencing them and leading to genomic stability. During cancer development this pattern is broken and the overall stability is lost, activating repeats, cryptic promoters and disrupting several neighboring genes. These aberrant genomic rearrangements will eventually select for the deactivation of tumour suppressor genes and the activation of oncogenic genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When we look at the H19/Igf2 cluster we find the following fragments next to each other: the Igf2 gene, an imprint control region (ICR), the H19 gene and an enhancer region. When you inherit this region from your father it is characterized by a methylated ICR and H19 promotor. This makes it possible for the enhancers to activate the expression of Igf2, leaving H19 unexpressed. When inherited by the mother on the other hand, the ICR and H19 promotor is unmethylated and will be bound by a CTCF insulator protein. This causes the enhancer regions to act on H19, now leaving Igf2 unexpressed. When by some disturbance of the epigenetic machinery the maternal allele gets a paternal methylation pattern, H19 is no longer expressed and Igf2 is overexpressed. This causes a large increase in cell growth with Wilm’s tumour as a consequence. Another possible disturbance of this locus is paternal uniparental disomy. Which is the syndrome where a patients has inherited to copies of his father en none of his mother. This is the cause of Beckwith-Wiedermann syndrome leading to a higher possibility of childhood cancers. When to maternal alleles are inherited, we get no expression of Igf2 and overexpression of H19 resulting in Silver-Russell dwarfism, yet another growth disorder. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA approved hypomethylation drug. The name of this class of drugs refers to there function; these type of drugs will lower the genome wide methylation state. Decitabine or, 2’-deoxy-5-azacytidine is an cytosine base analogue administered as a prodrug. In the body this molecule gets activated by deoxycytidine kinase, thereby obtaining its deoxyribonucleoside structure. Once it is in this form it becomes a substrate for the DNA replication machinery. During the next cell cycle this drug will be incorporated as a substitute for the normal cytosine. When DNMT comes around to methylate the newly formed DNA, decitabine will irreversibly bind with DNMT because of its nitrogen group incorporated in these molecules. Over time this will result in an genome wide drop of the methylation levels. In this way, silenced tumor suppressor genes in cancer patients may be reactivated, making the tumor more vulnerable to the more standard chemotherapeutic treatments.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When we look at cancers from all kinds of tissues, we observe an overall genome wide hypomethylation and a hypermethylation of CpG islands. This characteristic opens a window for a new class of cancer therapeutics which have an effect on the epigenetic machinery. Currently most of the research is invested in finding small molecular compounds which target the enzymatic epigenetic regulaters. The previously described drug Decitabine is such an example. This cytosine analogue will be incorporated in the genome and there it will irreversibly bind with DNMT. This will prevent this enzyme to methylate any DNA during the following cell cycles. Eventually this will lead to a drop in the genome wide methylation state, possible undo the DNA hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes, often seen in cancers. One must however by cautious because of the systemic use and possible side effects of these kinds of drugs when administering them to patients during sensitive periods in their lifetime. A specific example are children whom are still developing there germ cells. These cells undergo a huge amount of epigenetic reprogramming and are as a consequence very sensitive to drugs which intervene with the epigenetic machinery.</p></div>
