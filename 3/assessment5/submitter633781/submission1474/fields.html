    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are the places in genome where high Cytosines and Guanines are present and are bonded by phosphodiester bond. Most of the CpG islands normally in genome is not methylated because it makes about 60 percent of promoters. In cancer CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated as a result there is loss of function or reduced expresson of the gene whose promoter has been silenced. Also the methylation tend to move downstream or upstream to properly silence the gene.If that gene was tumor supressor then we tend to get cancer. Hypermethylation is induced by PRC1 and 2 and also assisted by HDACs. But in case of imprinted gene though outcome of DNA methylation depends on mode of  action of that promoter.</p>
<p>Repetitve elements and intergenic regions are normally highly methylated because of their function. Repetitive elements are basically jumparounds that insert themselves into anywhere in the genome. Intergenic regions are space between the genes which are not expressed. Repeat have strong promoters too so while jumping around the genome if they land near oncogene they tend to increase its expresssion and also can land into the tumor supressor gene silencing it. So they are highly methylated. But in cancer the repetitive elements and intergenic regions lose their methylation activating them.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster is found in human chromosme 11. H19 codes for protein H19 and Igf2 is the Insulin related growth factor 2 which helps to promote growth. This H19/Igf2 cluster is enhancer blocking imprinted gene cluster. The cluster contains Igf2 gene then downstream are CTCF then H19 then enhancers. In maternal genome CTCF gene is not methylated due to which CTCF protein can bind to the genome. CTCF is a insulator protein that restricts enhancers downstream to act on Igf2 which is the first preference. So instead Igf2 they act on H19 to increase its expression. In paternal genome CTCF is methylated due to which there is no CTCF protein to bind. So enhancers are free to act on Igf2 expressing it and the methylation of CTCF reach to H19 silencing it. In case of wilm's tumor somehow maternal CTCF is methylated so it behaves as paternal allele or patient inherits both the allele from father due to which H19 is silenced and Igf2 is over expressed. Being a growth promoter or oncogene double the dose of Igf2 eventually leads to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is the drug that belongs to the class DNMT inhibitors. Drugs in this class inhibit DNA methyl transferase. DNA methyl transferase is the set of enzymes that help methylate DNA. Decitabine is nucleoside analouges i.e. Decitabine get incorporated in the DNA upon replication and when DNMT comes for methyl transfer they are attached to Decitabine permanently. So there is no methylation of DNA. But this depend on the replication of the cell. If the cells are not dividing then Decitabine does not work. Since cancer cells are rapidly dividing and they do have to use DNMT at some point Decitabine is quite effective but if taken in low dose. If consumed in high doses can lead to toxicity and not much effective on cancer cells rather accect normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the best way to silencing the genome because the carbon carbon bond is very hard to break. So for the part of genome that needs to be silenced, use of DNA methylation is best option and we can see that these are the best markers that our epigenetic mechanism uses to lay down epigenetic marks. But these methylation markers are also removed by extensive enzymatic action when the epigenetic reprogramming occurs. During the period of human life there are two phases when epigenetic reprogramming occurs. One of the phase is early development period and next is primordial germ cell development. These are also called sensetive periods because a simple mistake or simple external influence can have great impact on how the epigenetic marks are rearranged. If patients are treated during sensetive period we might have unknown reprecussion. For example use of Decitabine in these period can lead to unmethylation of CTCF as a result proper amount of Igf2 is not produced and growth of the foetus is not as standard as it should have been.</p></div>
