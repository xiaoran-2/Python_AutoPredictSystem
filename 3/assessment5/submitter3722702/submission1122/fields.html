    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Methylation of CpG Islands - Normal function</strong></p>
<p>Methylation of cytosine is performed by DNMT1 methyltransferase. In certain places cytosine is located close to guanin on the DNA double strand (that is why it is called CpG island "cytosine-posphodiester bond-guanine " or CGI). Methylation of cytosine leads to silencing of the Gene where the CpG island is located (mostly affecting genes that transcribe for tumor suppressor genes). Silencing is caused by inhibition of the promotor or transcription factors. The methylation occurs symmetrically so that it is maintained during cell division and inherited mitotically (i.e. X inactivation @ Calico cats).</p>
<p><strong>Methylation of CpG Islands - Disruption in cancer</strong></p>
<p>Disruption of this process occurs as locus specific DNA hypermethylation or genome wide hypomethylation. This disuption progresses with time affecting several sets of CpG islands and genes. Finally adding to a greater amount of damage (Knudson multi hit hypothesis).</p>
<p><strong>Methylation of CpG islands - Contribution to cancer</strong></p>
<p>There are several examples for disrupted methylation leading to cancer</p>
<ul><li>RB1 in retinoblastome,</li>
<li>BRCA1 in breast cancer,</li>
<li>MGMT in glioma and CRC, </li>
<li>MLH1 in CRC (HNPCC Lynch syndrome).</li>
</ul><p>But we can also use these changes for diagnosing cancer. The GSTP1 change in prostate cancer is such a Biomarker. Other biomarkers are used in prognosis and for surveilling treatment of cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Methylation of intergenic regions &amp; repetitive elements - Normal function</strong></p>
<p>Most areas of the genome consist of intergenic regions and repetitive elements since these dont transcribe for mRNA. Methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is important for genomic stability.</p>
<p><strong>Methylation of intergenic regions &amp; repetitive elements - Disruption in cancer</strong></p>
<p>In cancer hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements can be observed. These changes progress with tumorgenicity and lead to instability of the genome</p>
<p><strong>Methylation of intergenic regions &amp; repetitive elements - contribution to cancer</strong></p>
<p>Examples for hypomethylation leading to cancer is<span> R-RAS in gastric cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During human development methylation status is changed. These changes occur differently for the paternal and maternal genome. Demethylation happens rapidly and active in the <strong>paternal</strong> genome whereas the <strong>maternal</strong> genome is demethylated more slowly and passive. The resetting of methylation marks is also different for each showing the same pattern: paternal genome - faster reestablished; maternal genome - slower reestablished.</p>
<p><strong>Beckwith Weidemann Syndrome (BWS)</strong> is caused by abnormalities in the <strong>H19/Igf2 cluster</strong> and is associated with hypermethylation of this imprinting control region. That leads to loss of imprinting and increased somatic growth. BWS is maternally transmitted. Two copies of one parental chromose occur. This is called <strong>uniparental disomy (UPD)</strong> with BWS showing paternal UPD.</p>
<p>This syndrome is charachterized by:</p>
<ul><li>Wilm's tumor of the kindey</li>
<li>macroglossia</li>
<li>overgrowth</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine</strong> is a cytidine analog and belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (<strong>DNMTi</strong>). As such it is approved for the treatment of(MDS) <strong>myelodysplastic syndrome</strong>.</p>
<p>DNMTi action is cell stage dependet. They <strong>act mainly on fast dividing cells</strong> such as tumor cells. Their action is <strong>dose dependent</strong>. In low dosage they will inhibit DNA methylation. Further increasing dosage will lead to nonspecific or even toxic effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Through large epidemiological studies (Dutch famine, Överkalix) and mice experiments (agouti viable yellow allele) researchers tried to follow epigenetic changes in following generations.</p>
<p>The <strong>sensitive period</strong> is the time of development when the epigenome is cleared (to restore totipotency) and reestablished or otherwise prone to enduring changes. These periods are different for men and women. Any way there are two phases of epigenetic reprogramming:</p>
<ol><li><strong>pre implantation period &amp; early development</strong></li>
<li><strong>primordial germ cell development</strong></li>
</ol><p>Using epigenome altering drugs in the ill patient will gain benefit. But we should be aware of severe side effects that can come up when given to patients in the sensitive periods. According to the <strong>genome defense model</strong> DNA methylation is mutagenic, but must also have a benefit.</p>
