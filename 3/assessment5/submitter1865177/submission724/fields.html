    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, DNA Methylation at CpG islands does not happen. These islands are usually located at the start of genes and methylation of these would cause the gene to be silenced. When methylation occures at tumor suppressor genes, cancer is the result because the gene responcible for cell growth is no longer functionings and can not regulate it.Intergenic regions are usually methylated and keep the genome stable by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites.Methylation of these repeates prevents illegitimate recombination between repeats. When hypormethylation happens, there is no longer stability in the genome and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes and illegitimate recombination between repeats occures. This genomic instability is what allows for cancer to happen.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele of the H19/<span>Igf2</span> cluster, DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF and causes silencing to spread to H19 in turn allows for enhancers to express <span>Igf2</span><span>. On the maternal allele CTCF is not methylated therefore H19 gets expressed. in wilm's tumour, a mutation/deletion, Uniparental disomy, or epigenetic disruption for loss of imprinting causes the maternal allele to behave like a paternal allele. This causes too much <span>Igf2 to be expressed, which is a growth promoting gene that can cause wilm's tumours.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodyspalstic syndromes. Decitabines removes methylation on DNA which can unsilence genes that regulate cell growth and control acute myelogenous leukaemia before it happens.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because methylation of the DNA can vastly change the epigenome and change how genes are expressed for a longer period of time, longer then it initally is done. It is unwise to to treat patients during sensiive periods.During these periods, like when epigenetic reprogramming occures in development of the child, epigenetics are more vunerable to alteration. treating a patient during one of these times could have a negitive outcome because the drug could alter more methylation then expected and cause other problems rather than fix the one it was aiming to due to increased vulnerability.</p></div>
