    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>High methylation at CpG islands allows the cell to silence a gene. In some cancer cells, CpG islands that should be methylated are not. This allows the concerned gene to be expressed. If it is a growth factor, it induces proliferation.</p>
<p>Methylation has the same role in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. But in normal cells, these are usually not methylated. In cancer cells, these regions are often methylated while they should not, inducing the silencing of nearby genes. When the genes involved are tumor suppressors, this allows the cells to escape cell death.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As a DNA demethylating agent, Decitabine can revert hypermethylation by inhibiting methyl transferase. This action can be antitumoral in cases of cancer showing much more methylation than normal cells</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A drug that changes the methylation state of DNA in a cell changes the level of expression of genes in that cell for a long period, even after the drug is not in the system anymore.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period during wich DNA methylation is drastically changed. For example the early development of embryo and the development of germ line cells. Considering this, It should be avoided to treat pregnant women. Indeed, if the methylation is disrupted during this periods, the fetus will probably have serious troubles or even die.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the methylation of a control region prevents the DNA strand from recruiting the insulator protein CTCF. In the absence of  CTCF, the downstream enhancer sequences can loop to promote the expression of Igf2. On the maternal allele, the absence of methylation allows CTCF to bind DNA and play its insulator role. In this case, the downstream enhancers cannot promote Igf2 expression anymore and will promote H19 expression instead.</p>
<p>In wilms tumor, overmethylation allows increasing expression of Igf2 wich is a growth promoter inducing tumor growth. </p></div>
