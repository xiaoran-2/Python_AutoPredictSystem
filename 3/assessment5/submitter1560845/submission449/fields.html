    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr">Overall, cancer cells have genome wide hypomethylation.  However, at CpG islands, there seems to be hypermethylation.  CpG islands can occur in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. CpG islands usually have very little methylation.   Methylation of these sites silences the tumor suppressor genes and is characteristic of cancer cells forming tumours. in fact, CpG hypermethylation is more common than mutations in tumour suppressor genes and it seems to increase with age.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are silenced by methylation and are part of heterochromatin.  This genome wide methylation contributes to genomic stability.  Only necessary genes, euchromatin, need to be accessible within the transcription factories of the nucleus. Cancer cells display genome wide hypomethylation which causes instability and a disruption in normal gene expression.  Repetitive elements are usually silenced to prevent illegitimate recombination and transposition of unwanted segments into genes. Intergenic regions can include promoters of oncogenes.  When these promoters are activated by de methylation, oncogenes are expressed and lead to cancer.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Imprinted Control Regions (ICR) are important in parent specific gene expression. At a certain locus for a specific gene, one allele from one parent is silenced while the other is expressed.  This epigenetic programming is maintained from embryo to adulthood through mitosis.  In a normal cell, the imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster is not methylated on the maternal allele.  This allows the protein CTCF to bind and protect H19 from methylation.  The nearby downstream enhancer will cause transcription of H19 and not act on Igf2 of the maternal chromosome making it silent.  On the paternal allele of the cluster, the ICR is methylated, so CTCF does not bind.  H19 is silenced, and the enhancer acts on Igf2.  In summary, H19 is expressed on the maternal allele and Igf2 is expressed on the paternal allele.</span></p>
<p><span><span>In cancer cells, there is hypermethylation of some imprint control regions early in cancer development.  In Wilm’s tumour, the H19/Igf2 cluster has its ICR methylated on both the maternal and paternal alleles.  This silences expression of H19 and causes an overexpression of Igf2.  The gene Igf2 codes for Insulin-Like Growth Factor and leads to growth of cancer cells and tumours.  </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia.   It acts as a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor.  It irreversibly binds DNMT in dividing cells.  Since cancer cells rapidly divide, they are more affected than normal cells.  However, normal cells are affected, but we don’t know the extent of it yet.  </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Epigenetic changes are passed from parent cell to daughter cells via mitosis.  Drugs that alter methylation patterns of a cell will be passed down to new cells even after treatment has ended.   Epigenetic changes should not occur in normal adult cells.  Epigenetic programming occurs before a baby is born while in the womb.  There are two periods of epigenetic programming known as sensitive periods, because during these times the genome is laying down epigenetic marks that will impact the life of the individual.  The two sensitive periods are during preimplantation (from zygote to blastocyst) and during primordial germ cell development of the epiblast. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A pregnant women must be treated differently than other patients.  Drugs she is given can alter the epigenome of the embryo during these sensitive periods.  Also, people of reproductive age have developing germ cells that can be sensitive to enzymatic epigenetic regulators.   </span></p>
