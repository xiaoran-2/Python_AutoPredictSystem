    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are regions with a high content of cytosine and guanine dinucleotides. They are usually near genes promoters. The methylation of a CpG island usually determines the activity of a gene. DNA methylation in a gene’s promoter and its nearby CpG islands is synonymous with inactivation or silence, whilst demethylation is usually associated with an active gene. When methylated, CpG islands assure the silencing of a gene. In cancer, the promoters of tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated (have more methylation than usual) and the promoters of oncogenes (cancer proliferating genes) are hypomethylated (have less methylation than usual). This disruption contributes by inactivating genes which protect you from cancer and the formation of tumors, which are the tumor suppressor genes. It further affects you by activating a gene that will proliferate cancer through its individual mechanism once activated, which is the oncogene. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated to either compact DNA or protect it from repetitive menaces such as long terminal repeat retrotransposons. The opposite happens in cancer, with intergenic regions and repetitive elements being hypomethylated. In turn, this disruption leaves DNA unnecessarily open and increases the genome’s susceptibility to mutations, be they mediated by molecular elements such as LTR retrotransposons, or environmental hazards such as radiation. Moreover, this openness could also lead to the activation of genes which are unnecessary or even detrimental to the function a given cell should have.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation pattern observed in the paternal allele normally is that the imprint control region or ICR is methylated, along with the H19 gene, causing a silencing of this gene. Therefore, the enhancers that are downstream are left acting on the Igf2 gene. In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated and CTCF binds to the region. This sums up to the H19 gene receiving the effect of the enhancers and Igf2 not being expressed on the maternal allele. In the Wilm’s tumor, the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted because the maternal allele ends up with a hypermethylated ICR, silencing H19 expression and giving the cell a double dose of Igf2, due to both alleles expressing the gene. Igf2 is a gene that has to do with growth, so having a double dose of it will lead to abnormal growth. In the case of the Wilm’s tumor, an abnormal growth will be identified as a tumor on the patient’s kidney. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors or DNMTis. The impact it has is that when a DNMT attempts to methylate a CpG dinucleotide, it confuses the nucleotide with the drug, and the DNMT is irreversibly stuck on the drug. This means no more hypermethylation, as the DNMTs are lowering in quantity each time the cell divides. This has an anti-tumor effect because usually tumor suppressor genes are receiving hypermethylation in cancer. Eventually, the fast division without DNMTs will allow the tumor suppressor gene to be demethylated and commence to function against the tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome, because, once in place, DNA methylation stands remarkably constant throughout a person’s life, with exceptions to a few sensitive periods where the marks are being edited. Sensitive periods are defined as points in development where the epigenome is being reprogrammed, cleared, and reset, making it susceptible to a wide variety of environmental effects. Such periods are the days of embryonic development, and also the development of primordial germ cells. Treating a patient during those sensitive periods is inadvisable because it could severely affect the reprogramming that will be occurring. For example, a DNMTi would leave any cell that has currently been stripped of methylation, completely demethylated, leaving the patients entire genome exposed, possibly for his or her life, and perhaps even the life of their progeny. </div>
