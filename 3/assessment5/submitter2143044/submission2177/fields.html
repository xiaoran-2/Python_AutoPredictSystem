    <div class="field-value"><p>In non-cancerous cells, CpG islands, which are often found in the gene promoters, are typically protected from DNA methylation in order for that gene to be expressed. So, hypermethylation at a gene promoter's CpG island would instead cause silencing of that gene as transcriptionary binding to the promoter is inhibited. Also, DNA methylation is normally higher for intergenic regions and repetitive elements, because in non-cancerous cells these sequences do not play a direct role in genetic expression and are therefore silenced. However, in cancer cells the situation is reversed so that CpG island (and CpG island shore) methylation is high, thus inhibiting expression of normal genes such as tumor suppressor genes, and methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is low, specifically allowing oncogenes to be activated to promote uncontrollable growth and cell immortality.  In general, the genetic code undergoes global hypermethylation, possibly meaning that the greater volume of sequences are silenced rather than unsilenced. In the first case, where needed genes are silenced, normal functions of the cell are shut down. For example, tumor cells in the adrenal glands would no longer produce the appropriate hormones that the body needs, but rather they would remain unregulated and unresponsive to the body's chemical signals, additionally disrupting the work of the healthy neighboring cells. Futhermore, since tumor supressor genes are silenced, regular apoptosis, cell cycle, and DNA repair are disrupted. In the second case, where non-expressed genetic code is unsilenced, neighboring genes can be disrupted, a lot of nonsensical genetic sequences can be exposed and expressed, along with transposable elements, which upon cell division may randomly insert themselves into the genetic code by recombination. Thus, in addition to the rapid division caused by unsilencing oncogenes, there is also a much higher chance of mutation with each division, so there is more genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the maternal allele, the Imprinted Control Region (ICR), which is placed between genes Igf2 and H19, remains unmethylated allowing the binding of the insulator protein CTCF to the ICR. CTCF insulates Igf2 from the effect of the enhancers that are downstream of H19, meaning that the expression of Igf2 is not increased, thus the enhancers then act upon the H19 gene instead, increasing its expression. On the paternal allele, since the ICR is methylated CTCF is unable to bind to it, so the methylation mark is able to spread to H19 to silence it and thus the enhancers are able to act upon the uninsulated gene Igf2, while ignoring H19. In short, Igf2 expression is increased on the paternal allele and decreased on the maternal one. In Wilm's Tumour, which occurs in the kidneys during childhood, there is hypermethylation of the ICR, which barely affects the paternal allele, since the ICR is already methylated, but for the maternal allele it means that the ICR also becomes methylated. Thus, there is now a double dose of oncogene Igf2 (growth promoter) and a lack of H19 in the tumour cell, which in turn downregulates Cdkn1c (growth regulator), allowing for the tumour to grow rapidly. If this imprinting is globally disrupted in most cells, then Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome is very likely.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an enzymatic regulator, specifically a DNA methyltransfrease inhibitor (DNMTi), meaning that it indirectly demethylates DNA. Particularly, Decitabine is a nucleoside analog similar to 5-Azacytidine that is included into the DNA in replication, so that when DNMT1 comes along it permanently binds to the incorporated Decitabine so that it can no longer methylate DNA further down. This basically creates hypomethylation in cells that divide rapidly, counteracting the general hypermethylation, particularly for CpG islands and shores, that occurs in the rapidly dividing tumor cells. This counter-effect then protects Genes with CpG islands from being silenced, especially the tumor suppressing genes, so that they can still regulate the cell's cycle and DNA repair. However, Decitabine may also have a long term effect in which all cells globally become less methylated due to the growing number of overall cell divisions in the body, so there may be greater effects in aging and genetic instability.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some enzyme regulators, especially those that are directly incorporated into RNA or DNA upon replication, have a lasting effect beyond the treatment period, beacuse the epigenetic marks that they act upon are mitotically heritable. For instance, Decitabine reduces DNA methylation, and since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable due to DNMT1's effect on hemi-methylated DNA, Decitabine's inhibition of DNMT1 basically reduces the heritability of that methylation. Thus this reduced methylation is then inherited by all future progeny cells so the effect is felt even after treatment concludes, likely increasing genomic instability. A sensitive period is when cells are undergoing epigenetic reprogramming, such that certain DNA methylation marks are removed. One period is in pre-implantation early development, when a zygote is first formed, up until the blastocyst stage, before implantation and placenta formation. Another sensitive period is during primordial germ cell development, which starts in a mid-gestation embryo and continues through spermatogenesis or oogenesis. In both of these periods maternal and paternal genome demethylation is highest, as well as high imprinted gene demethylation for the second period. This means that these drug treatments, if implemented at sensitive periods, would lower DNA methylation even further, causing massive genomic instability either for the gametes of an adult or for the developing embryo, increasing likelihood of disorders in future offspring.</p>
