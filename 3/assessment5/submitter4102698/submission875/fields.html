    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, DNA methylation profile are different from the normal tissues,with the Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation and the locus specific DNA hypermethylation.The function of DNA methylation in CpG islands is to silence the related gene expression in normal cells.In cancer cells, the CpG islands associated with tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated, which lead to abnormal replication of cells. The epimutations are rapidly selected, and the abnormal cells accumulate, which finally contributes to disease. And the intergenic region and repetitive elements are related to the genome stability. Cells can correctly transcribe, transcript.  But these regions are hypomethylated in cancer cells, which will lead to the aberrations of protein and abnormal karyotype.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>THe disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer.Take H19/lgf2 cluster as an example. In normal case,on the paternal allele, the ICR of the H19/lgf2 cluster is methylated and  prevent CTCF binding to ICR, so that the downstream enhancers can bind to the promoter of lgf2, and activate the expression of lgf2. On the maternal allele, the ICR of the H19/lgf2 is unmethylated allowing CTCF to bind. So the downstream enhancers cannot bind to the promoter of lgf2, and silencing the lgf2 expression. In Wilm's tumour,both allele of ICR are methylated.  H19  is silencing as a tumor suppressor gene, so it lead to  the diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, which is a nucleoside analogues, irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorpporated into DNA,  when cells are replicating. The cancer cells duplicate very rapidly, and they need DNMT to keep the hypermethylation state of daughter cells. After the treatment of Decitabine, the methylation state can not be heritable. So the cancer cells turn to die.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can be transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through the gametes.A sensitive period is the one when the remodling of epigenome is activated, and the epigenetic markers are being moved or added. There are two sensitive periods，one is during the early embryonic development, the other is during the primordial germ cell development. If treating patient during sensitive periods, the epigenetic machinary will be interrupted, so the epigenome of the embryo or the sperms/eggs will be abberant.</p></div>
