    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a stable and inactive epigenetic mark which occurs exclusively at CpG islands and is maintained by DNMT1 which recognises hemi methylated DNA strand and lays down methylation on new daughter strand.Since it is copied by daughter strand at every cell division it is considered to be a stable epigenetic mark. Methylation of CpG islands is associated with formation of repressive chromatin structures , tend to prohibit transcriptional factor binding and alter gene expression .Hence CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation which leads to silencing of gene expression.Eg Inactivation of Xchromosome  which is visible in female calico cats coat color( mottled).In Cancer there is activation of oncogenes and Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Cancer cells undergo Hyper methylation at CpG islands instead of hypo methylation.There is loss of imprinting at ICR .DNA hyper methylation is reversible.Eg MLHI in Colorectal Cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions or Repetitive elements are generally methylated in normal cells but opposite occurs in cancer cells which leads to genome wide hypo methylation.It is the earliest found epigenetic abnormality.Hypomethylation depends on the location.It generally leads to oncogene activation due to poor promoters.Eg miRNA 21 activates tumor suppressor gene p TEN in Gliomas.Hypo methylation at Repeats happens early and progresses with time which leads to Genomic instability like Deletions, Reciprocal Translocations,Insertions etc</p>
<p>Role of DNA methylation in cancer is context dependent.Deletion of DNMT1 can enhance or suppress tumorigenesis.If tumor is driven by Tumor suppressor hypermethylation then depletion of DNA methylation appears to suppress tumorigenesis or if it is driven by chromosomal instability then depletion of DNA methylation enhances tumorigenesis.It is also stage specific i.e Early or late in tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic reprogramming in Paternal genome is rapid and active demethylation as it is done via hydroxylation.In Maternal genome it is Passive demethylation as DNMT1 is excluded from nucleus.After implantation the epigenetic marks are re-established in lineage specific fashion.</p>
<p>Genomic immprinting is mono allelic gene expression,allele specific and tissue specific.Imprint is associated with DNA at Imprint control region( ICR).H19 is a long non coding RNA.H19/IgF2 cluster is present on human chromosome 11.</p>
<p>In Maternal allelewhen ICR is unmethylated ,it is bound by CTCF which is a insulator protein.It insulates IgF2 from downstream enhancers and enhances H19 to be expressed as enhancers cannot bind to IgF2.Hence IgF2 is not expressed</p>
<p>In Paternal allele When ICR is methylated  it blocks binding of CTCF .Hence enhancers bind to IgF2 which is expressed.Without CTCF DNA Methylation spreads to H19 promoters to silence its expression.</p>
<p>Upregulation of Growth promoting genes like IgF2,loss of imprimting,loss of tumor suppressor genes leads to cancer.symptoms are fetal or post natal over growth,Macroglossia,Predisposition to embryonic/childhood tumors .eg Wilm’s tumors which occurs in kidney.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor whichis FDA approved.It is approved for Myelodysplastic syndrome which leads to Acute Mylegenous leukemia.It is Nucleoside analogue.</p>
<p>DNA Methylation is laid down by DNA METHYL TRANSFERASES which occurs exclusively at CpG islands.It leads to conversion of cytosine to 5 methyl cytosine.It is maintained by DNMT1 which recognizes hemi methyled DNA strands.</p>
<p>Decitabine irreversibly binds to DNMT after they are incorporated into DNA hence it cannot replicate and daughter cells are not methylated.Cancer cells replicate fast and they are severly affected.Decitabine is replication dependent.</p>
<p>It was first used in 1970 in high dosages which was toxic.Hence now adays they are used in relatively lower doses .Therefore it has ANTI NEOPLATIC EFFECTas it is involved in DNA demethylation.Trials are done on many more tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sensitive periods are when altered environment have an effect on epigenetic control.Sensitive periods are a)primordial germ cell development to production of matured eggs or sperms  b)Pre Implantation and Post Implantation periods.when epigenetic marks are removed and laid down.</p>
<p>Treating patients during these periods is not advisable because of Transgenerational inheritance .i.e inheritance of phenotypes/gene expression patterns from parents to offsprings by passage through germ cells .These are sensitive periods as epigenetic marks are established rather than maintained.</p>
<p> Altering DNA Methylation can have enduring effect which include genome wide loss and regional gain of methylation which causes genomic instability and also silencing of tumor suppressor genes.It causes global changes in chromatin.It can cause activation of oncogenes.epimutations are reversible.</p>
