    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the DNA at cytosines. CpG is where we find mostly methylation in mammals, and they are found at promoters of genes clustered into CpG islands. The normal function of methylation at CpG islands is related to silencing of gene expression. Methylated CpG islands means silenced genes. These CpG islands are usually unmethylated. DNA methylation also occurs in intergenic regions and in repetitive elements. The function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is maintaining genomic integrity. These regions are usually methylated, preventing abnormal karyotype due to genomic instability.</p>
<p>There are CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. The methylation on these CpG islands causes silencing of the tumor suppressor genes by locking in acyl in active state. This hypermethylated CpG islands differ by tumor type. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, a mother cell with these CpG islands methylated will have daughter cells with the same CpG islands methylated. In this way, there’s no tumor suppressor genes activated to stop cancer’s growth.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements cause genomic instability, which lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats. This results in things like reciprocal translocations between two different chromosomes. With the repeats activated, they have the capacity to make a copy of themselves and jump around the genome or transpose, which lead to consequent problems, depending where they jump. They may disrupt the coding region of a gene, or may activate neighboring genes. The overall outcome of hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements are additional deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.</p>
<p>Thanks to the genome-wide DNA hypomethylation leading to genomic instability, and CpG islands hypermethylation, oncogenes are turned on and tumor suppressor genes are turned off. In this way, some tumors are driven by tumor suppressor hypermethylation, making them divide rapidly, and others by chromosomal instability, so depletion of DNA methylations enhances tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic alterations are reversible. So we can use drugs to target enzymatic epigenetic regulators. One of these epigenetic inhibitors is Decitabine. This drug belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. It’s nucleoside analogue that binds to DNMTs upon replication. In this way, the DNMTs are trapped and methylation is inhibited. In the presence of Decitabine, a significant proportion of the DNA becomes hemimethylated. At the second round of DNA synthesis results in full double-stranded DNA demethylation. So Decitabine’s action is division dependent. This means that cancer cells which are dividing much more rapidly than most of the cells of the body will be more severely affected. Decitabine has antitumor activity at lower doses, especially in myelodysplastic syndrome. High doses have nonspecific toxicity.</p>
<p>In summary, the treatment with Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation, reactivating epigenetically silenced genes, resulting in expression of tumor suppressor genes and other regulatory functions. So, epigenetic therapy can effect changes which stop cancer’s growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation act to regulate gene expression in normal mammalian development. It’s the basis for different epigenetic phenomena. DNA methylation leads to silence of gene expression. It helps to maintain transcriptional silence in nonexpressed or noncoding regions of the genome. DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent cell generations (mitotic heritability). But there are periods of development when occurs epigenetic reprogramming, the sensitive periods: the period of primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation and early post implantation period. In these periods occur demethylation of genome and resetting of epigenetic marks. Both of these periods are sensitive to epigenetic control. So, environment can alter epigenetic makeup.</p>
<p>It’s inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because these periods are more likely to change the epigenome. In these periods occur reprogramming of epigenetic marks, and the treatment with drugs that inhibit DNA methylation will not only affect the expression of tumor suppressor genes. DNA methylation inhibition disrupts epigenetic reprogramming, because there isn’t DNMTs to methylate the unmethylated DNA on these periods of development. After these periods, there will be a low level of methylated DNA. This epigenetic information is passed on to subsequent cell generations, and can be inherited by the offspring through the germ cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted genes is controlled by enhancer blocking. The ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. This means that it’s paternally imprinted.</p>
<p>When ICR is unmethylated , it’s bound by CTCF. CTCF is an insulator protein: insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Because it’s insulating Igf2, these enhancers are free to act on H19 (long noncoding RNA that’s being produced) and enhance its expression on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>When this ICR is methylated, CTCF can no longer bind, insulation action isn’t present, therefore the enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and promote its expression from the paternal allele. In this way, Igf2 is only expressed from the paternal allele. H19 is no longer active on the paternal allele because of DNA methylation spreading.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation in this ICR results in a loss of imprinting. With loss of imprinting, there’s a high permethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele as well. Now there’s expression of Igf2 on maternal allele too, creating a double dose of Igf2. Since Igf2 is growth promoting, it’s associated with Wilm’s tumour. So the hypermethylation of H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted genes creates a double dosage of Igf2, that will promote growth and the final result is Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>
