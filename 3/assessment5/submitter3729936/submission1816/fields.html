    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the specific epigenetic modifications, where it almost exclusively occurs at CPG dinucleotides in mammals. Methylation takes place at three sites: CPG islands "CGIs", intergenic regions and repetitive elements. CPGs clustered into <strong>CGIs</strong> which are often at promoters of genes. CGIs tend to be protected from methylation<strong> "unmethylated"</strong>, allowing the genes to be expressed, cause methylation at CGI means silencing of gene expression.<strong> While in cancer</strong>, CGIs are methylated. This hypermethylation leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes; moreover, this methylation is progressive as the tumorgenesis takes pkace, passing through these stages (normal tissue to hyperplastic to neoplastic then invasion to blood vessels and finally, metastasis). Moreover, the identity of hypermethylated CGIs varies by tumor type, for example: RB gene in retinoblastoma and BRCA1 in breast cancer. It is believed that cancer happens due to genetic mutations and epigenetic changes "epigenetic mutations". Unlike the genetic mutations, these epigenetic changes are reversible, so they are open to drug treatment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Normally, <strong>intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong> are usually <strong>methylated</strong>, where, methylation in this case maintain genomic integrity, as it was proposed by Professor Bestor in "Genome Defense Model". Methylation of intergenic regions leads to silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites, while, in case of repetitive elements, it leads to silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, avoiding transcriptional interference from strong promoters and preventing illegitimate recombination.<strong> The opposite occurs in cancer</strong>, where, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hpomethylated. As a result, genomic instability take places.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Contribution of methylation to cancer can be summarized in two points:</strong> hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, and hypomethylation genome-wide (including hypomethylation of CPG poor promoters which can result in activation of genes as R-RAS in gastric cancer, in addition to hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of imprinting control regions (ICRs) has different effects depending on mood of action of ICR. As a result, ICR DNA methylation doesn't necessarily correlate with silencing of gene expression. In case of H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted genes, the ICR is<strong> unmethylated on the maternal allele</strong> and <strong>methylated on the paternal allele. </strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong>On <strong>the maternal allele</strong>, the ICR is bound by an insulator protein called CTCF. CTCF insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers, leading those enhancers to act on H19 and enhances its expression, while on<strong> the paternal allele</strong>, ICR is methylated so CTCF can't bind to it, so Igf2 isn't insulated from the action of enhancers, leading to promoting Igf2 expression from the paternal allele. This means that Igf2 is <strong>paternally imprinted.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Generally, alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypomethylation or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In case of Wilm's tumor</strong>, <strong>hypermethylation</strong> of ICR occurs, leading to appearance of two paternal like alleles and loss of the maternal allele (due to methylation of ICR). As a result, <strong>Igf2 is over-expressed</strong>, where Igf2 promotes growth as it is an oncogene.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNMT inhibitors "DNA demythylating agents". Decitabine is sold as Dacogen by a Japanese company. DNMT inhibitors are nucleoside analogues, irreversibly bind DNMTs after the incorporation into DNA, so when the DNMT1 bind that nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, it is bound irreversibly and can't be released. As a result, DNMT inhibitors are replication dependent, and since the cancer cells are dividing more rapidly than normal cells, they will be more severely affected.</p>
<p>Decitabine is used in treatment of hematological malignancies, mainly myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursor of acute myelogenousleukemia, as the hematological malignancies depend on CGI hypermethylation "tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation". Decitabine causes fewer side effects, improving life quality that leads to increasing life expectancy. However, high doses are toxic and have no specific effects leading to illness of the patient, while in low doses, it has a very good anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The idea of epigenetic therapy is to stay away from killing the cell. Rather, the epigenetic drugs act by changing the instructions of cancer cells through epigenetic changes. These epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells (mitotically heritable) until they are actively erased. For example, azacitidine and decitabine "DNMT inhibitors" wich act by incorporation into DNA and leading to trapping of DNMTs and methylation is inhibited. Thus, in presence of these analogues, a significant proportion of the DNA becomes hemimethylated. A second round of DNA synthesis in the presence of these drugs results in full double stranded DNA demethylation.</p>
<p>During treating people with epigenetic therapy, sensitive periods of development should be taken in consideration. A sensitive period is a period actually sensitive to epigenetic control. These periods are periods of active remodeling of the epigenome. </p>
<p>There are two sensitive periods: embryogenesis "pre and post-implantation stages", and during primordial germ cells development. As a result, these drugs should be avoided in case of young child "primordial germ cells development" or a pregnant woman (because of the expected serious side effects to the fetus).</p></div>
