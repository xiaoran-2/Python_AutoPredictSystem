    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells epigenetic modifications to the genome occur through DNA methylation. DNA methylation is usually involved in the epigenetic silencing of genes, it is also used to maintain the genomic stability of the genome. Making sure that we do not lose or gain chromosomes and that there is no illegitimate recombination between chromosomes that shouldn’t occur.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>CpG islands are found at the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes. Tumour supressor genes are responsible for intiating apoptosis. In normal cells these CpG islands are hypomethylated (not methylated), this allows the cells to transcribe these genes as they are in an active state. In cancer cells these CpG Islands are found to be hypermethylated (highly methylated), this means that these tumour suppressor genes have been epigenetically silenced. Silencing of these genes allows the cells to continuosly proliferate and thus become immortal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The disruption of DNA methylation at the CpG Islands contributes to disease especially to cancer as it is one hit to the genome. The Knudson hypothesis states that the genome must sustain many genetic mutations that will accumulate and develop disease such as cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In general for a normal cell there is hypomethylation at the CpG Islands but hypermethylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions. In cancer it is reversed, there is hypermethylation at CpG Island and hypomethylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions. This hypomethylation of the repetitive elements contributes to the genomic instability of the genome and can allow illegitimate recombination between chromosomes such as recipricol translocations, deletions and insertions in chromosomes. The hypomethylation of the repetitive regions and intergenic regions causes the chromatin to be packaged as euchromatin instead of hetrochromatin. Due to this change in packaging this means that the DNA is more accessible to proteins that will allow the transcription of genes that are usually hidden and thus silenced or genomic translocations to occur.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells there is a hypermethylation of the Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs) which results in a loss of imprinting. ICRs are usually involved in either growth promotion or growth repression. The H19/Igf2 cluster is usually hypomethylated on the maternal allele and hypermethylated on the paternal allele. The hypomethylation on the maternal allele allows the CTCF to bind to the ICR and allows the enhancers to act on H19 allowing it to be expressed, however the Igf2 will be silent on the maternal allele. The hypermethylation on the paternal allele allows the enhancers to act directly on Igf2 allowing it to be expressed and silencing H19 from the paternal allele.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cancer the ICRs on the H19/Igf2 cluster become hypermethylated. If both of the ICRs on both of the maternal and paternal alleles are methylated then CTCF cannot bind and thus the enhancers will act directly on Igf2 on both the maternal and paternal alleles resulting in double the amount of Igf2 being expressed by the cell. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene the loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster results in Wilm’s tumour, it is a tumour of the kidneys that is seen in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that acts as a DNA- demethylating agent and it is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. Decitabine causes a decrease in DNA methylation within the genome as it inhibits DNA methyltransferase. DNA methyltransferase usually adds methyl groups to the genome therefore by inhibiting it with decitabine the overall level of DNA-methylation will decrease.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This can have an anti tumour effect because some cancers are driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation while others are driven by chromosomal instability as a result of DNA hypomethylation. Myelodysplastic syndromes tend to be driven by the hypermethylation at CpG Islands therefore decreasing the number of tumour suppressor genes available as they have all been silenced. If these patients are treated with Decitabine then the DNA at these CpG islands will become demethylated and thus activate the tumour suppressor genes again thus suppressing tumourgenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the genome as these are epigenetic modifications that can silence genes such as DNA methylation at CpG islands will silence tumour suppressor genes. These epigenetic modifications are mitotically heritable meaning that they will be passed on to daughter cells. In cancer this is quite a clever way to ensure that all future daughter cells have their tumour suppressing genes silenced thus allowing continual growth of the tumour as apoptosis will no longer occur. If we can alter the DNA methylation it will have an enduring effect on the genome as it is passed onto generations of daughter cells, these effects would last longer than the period of drug treatment as it will continue to be inherited by daughter cells as long as those cells are dividing. A sensitive period is a period of time whereby the individual is undergoing significant genomic change such as during early development. An example of early development would be during embryogenesis and then in the early stages of infancy and childhood. It is around these times that environmental factors can influence our epigenome the most. If we were to treat patients during these sensitive periods it would cause significant changes to their epigenomes that would be passed on to all daughter cells, this can affect future generations. </p></div>
