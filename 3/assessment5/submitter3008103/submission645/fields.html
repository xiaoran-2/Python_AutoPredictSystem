    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Normal DNA methylation:</strong> Normally there is hypomethylation at CpG islands.</p>
<p><strong>Disruption:</strong> This is reveresed in cancer, as the CpG islands become hypermethylated.</p>
<p><strong>How disruption contributes: </strong>Normally, DNA hypomethlylation at CpG islands allows tumour suppressor genes to be expressed, thus restricting cancerous growth. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so the activation of the tumour suppressor genes is normally perpetuated in cell division.</p>
<p>However, when the DNA methylation is removed, the associated tumour suppressor gene is silenced. Without expression of the tumour suppressing genes, cancerous growth can occur.</p>
<p>If the growth rate for these cancerous cells is faster than normal cells, then the cancerous cells may become more populous than the normal cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Normal intergenic regions and repetitive elements: </strong>Normally hypermethylation is in repetitive elements and intergenic region </p>
<p><strong>Disruption: </strong>This is reveresed in cancer. Hypomethylation is seen in the repetitive elements and intergenic region.</p>
<p><strong>How disruptions contributes:</strong> </p>
<p>Hypomethylation removes silencing of the associated genes. This causes genome wide instability.</p>
<p>Repeats: Hypomethylation of repetitive regions causes genomic instability. Specifically, it leads to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of the repeats and transposition of the repeats.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation in CpG poor promoters: This activates the associated genes, which may be related to cancerous growth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Overall, role of DNA methylation is context dependent. It may be beneficial or harmful depending on the type of tumour, as well as the stage of the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Methylation pattern of paternal allele:</strong> If ICR is hypermethylated, CTCF will NOT bind to ICR. </p>
<p><strong>How this determines lgf2 expression: </strong>Thus, enhancers will act on Igf2 instead of H19. Therefore, Igf2 is expressed. </p>
<p><strong>Methylation pattern of maternal allele:</strong> If ICR is hypomethylated, CTCF will bind to the ICR. </p>
<p><strong>How this determines lgf2 expression: </strong>Thus, enhancers will act on H19, whereas Igf2 will be silent. </p>
<div><strong>How imprinting is disrupted in Wilm's:</strong> The maternal ICR will also be hypermethylated, which means that Igf2 will be expressed on both mathernal and paternal alleles.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>How disrupting imprinting at H19/lgf2 contributes: </strong>Since Igf2 is growth promoting, so a cell with Wilm's tumour will have a double dose of this Igf2 expression.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine</strong> - Class of epigenetic inhibitors: DNMT inhibitor. Nucleoside Analogue.  Cell must replicate for this to work.</p>
<p><strong>Impact on DNA methylation</strong>: This drug would demethylate the CpG islands which have become hypermethylated at the sites of tumour suppressor genes. Get incorporated into the DNA, and then the DNMT is bound irreversibly and can no longer be released.</p>
<p><strong>How it has an anti-tumour effect</strong>: Since Decitabine would remove the hypermethylation, the tumour suppressor genes would be activated again. The expression of these tumour supressor genes would counteract the effect of the cancerous growth occuring in the cell. Since tumour cells are replicating faster, they will exhibit the effect of the DNMT inhibitor more than normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>How altering DNA methylation can have enduring effect on epigenome:</strong> DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. As such, the extent of DNA methylation will be passed on to new cells in mitosis.</p>
<p><strong>What is meant by a sensitive period:</strong> They are periods when altered environment has influence on epigentic makeup. Removal and laying down of epigenetic marks</p>
<p><strong>What are the sensitive periods of development:</strong></p>
<p>- premordial germ cell development through to gametes</p>
<p>- preimplantation and postimplantation periods</p>
<p>- brief periods when specific tissues are specializing</p>
<p><strong>Why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable:</strong> This would be inadvisable because</p>
<p>1) These sensitive period may allow for a more pervasive adjustment of DNA methylation. Therefore, DNA methylation may be altered for genes other than the ones being targeted,</p>
<p>2) If adjustment to DNA methylation occurs during a sensitive period, the laying down of markers at the end of the sensitive period may erase the effect of the treatment.</p>
<p>3) the adjustment of DNA methylation may lead to trangenerational epigentic inheritance, which may have unintended consequences for future generations.</p></div>
