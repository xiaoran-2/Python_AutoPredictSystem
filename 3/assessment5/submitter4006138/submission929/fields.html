    <div class="field-value"><p>An unusual density of CpG dinucleotides, referred to as CpG islands, is often found in the promoter regions of actively transcribed genes. In most of the cases, the cytidines of these CpG dinucleotides tend to be unmethylated in position 5, resulting in open chromatin structures, which facilitate RNA polymerase accession and, in turn, gene activity. In cancer cells, however, most promoters become progressively more methylated at CpG islands, leading to gene silencing.  Since, among the silenced genes, have been found a number of tumor suppressor genes, the cancer-induced hypermethylation of CpG islands contributes actively to cancer establishment and progression. In contrast to promoter regions, intergenic and repetitive elements of actively transcribed genes tend to be methylated. The methylation of these intergenic and repetitive regions is thought to prevent illegitimate recombinations between repeats as well as other forms of DNA exchanges, contributing to genome stability. In addition, the methylation of repetitive elements, such as transposons, LINEs and SINEs, is essential to prevent them to jump into different chromosome locations, as well as to switch off the activity of cryptic promoters which might lay on those repetitive elements. In cancer these intergenic regions and, above all, repetitive elements become more and more hypomethylated. This new epigenetic environment results in open chromatin strucutures, which allow illegitimate recombination to take place and, in turn, leads to the genetic instability, which characterizes many tumors. Moreover, the lost of repressive methyl groups at repetitive elements reactivates transposons and cryptic promoters further increasing genetic instability and leading to abnormal activity of either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The main hallmark of cancer cells is their power of growth without limits, as cancer cells grow without responding to normal cell regulations.  Accordingly, tumor cells do not age, grow faster than normal cells, escape cell death and growth suppression, and do not respond to imprinted gene regulation.  This latter feature is exemplified by the deregulation of normal imprinting observed in Wilm’s tumor at the H19/Igf2 cluster. Normally, the paternal allele shows methylation of the imprinting control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster. As a consequence, the insulator protein CTCF can no longer bind to ICR allowing expression of the growth promoter H19. In addition the methylation on ICR spreads to nearby regions, resulting in silencing of the growth regulator Igf2. By contrast, ICR is unmethylated in the maternal allele, leading to Igf2 silencing and H19 expression. The allele-of-origin regulation is lost in Wilm’s tumor and also the maternal allele is methylated at the ICR of H19/Igf2 cluster. Accordingly, both maternal and paternal alleles behave in the same way, displaying expression of the growth-promoting Igf2 oncogene and silencing of the growth-suppressor lncRNA H19, which, in turn, leads to deregulated cell proliferation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A breakthrough in cancer research was the realization that, in cancer development, epigenetic damages are as important as, if not more important than, DNA damages. Accordingly, novel epigenetics drugs have being developed for cancer treatment with encouraging results. Decitabine, an epigenetic drug belonging to the class of inhibitors of <em>de novo</em> methyl transferases, was among the first to be authorized by FDA, and commercially sold as Decogel by a Japanese company. Contrary to more specific drugs, such as JQ1, which specifically inhibits the DNA methylating enzyme EZH2, Decitabine has a generic demethylating effects, similarly to azacitidine. Since hypermethylation at specific promoters is one of the most distinguishing feature of cancer cells, a general demethylating action is likely beneficial in some tumors, such as myelogenous syndrome, or acute myelogenic leukaemia, in spite of the deleterious effect that demethylation might have on the large hypomethylated regions that characterize, genome-wide, cancer progression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because of the reversibile nature of epigenetic modifications, epigenetic drugs that are being developed so far performed extremely well, with high percentage of remission and few secondary effects. Surprisingly, the effects of these drugs last long after treatment as patients, even when treatment was not effective, became more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. According to Dr Baylin, this is because modifications that may occur to epigenetic make up are mitotically maintained within individual’s life spans, but erased during sensitive periods, such as post-fertilization or germ line development.  It is not clear, as yet, how these drugs can leave undisturbed the epigenetic pattern of normal cells, but it’s a matter of fact that, at low dosage, these chemioterapics are effective and well tollerateted by patients. A likely hypothesis argue that cancer cells, being very active, are more sensitive than normal cells to drug treatment, while another hypothesis speculates that cancer cells are highly sensitive to epigenetic drugs because behave as stem cells.  At present, however, it’s inadvisable, treating children and pregnant women with epigenetic drugs, because their cells are in sensitive periods when epigenetic marks are temporally erased, and the long-term consequences of these treatment are unknown.</p></div>
