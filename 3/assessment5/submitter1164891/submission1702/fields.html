    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation</strong> is one of the specific epigenetic modifications. It usually occurs at CpG dinucleotides by <em>de novo</em> methyltransferases, DNMT3a and DNMT3b in mammals. The CpGs are clustered into CpG islands ,often at the promoters of the genes, tend to be protected from methylation. It implies that if the CpG island of a gene is methylated then the particular gene expression is silenced. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. DNA methylation at CpG islands in cancer are classified into locus specific DNA hypermethylation and genome wide DNA hypomethylation. Since DNA methylation leads to silencing of gene expression, it s used to silence/suppress the <strong>tumor supressing genes</strong>in cancer. Here the CpG islands are hypermethylated leading to hypermethylated tumor suppressors . The other sites of methylation on a gene are intergenic regions and repetitive elements, these sites are usually methylated unlike the CpG islands. At the intergenic site , DNA methylation leads to silencing of the initiation site of the cryptic transcription( cryptic unstable transcripts are a subset of long non-coding RNAs). Now at the repetitive elements, it leads to the silencing of the repeats ,therefore, preventing transposition ,avoiding transpositional interferencefrom strong promoters, and may also prevent illegitimate recombination. In cancer, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hypomethylated leading to Illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Enough evidence have been collected to show that the DNA methylation leads to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation of the imprint control regions(ICRs) does not corelate with the silencing of the gene expression. <br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-e53475eb2a60530d39387864/970238/asst-5/970238-521275febed0e6.60075842.jpg" alt="" /> </p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated so it allows the CTCF protein to bind to it, which is an insulator protien. It blocks the enhancers from activating the Igf2 cluster leading to the activation of H19 cluster. Whereas in the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated ,therefore, not allowing the CTCF protein to bind to it. This enables the enhancers to activate the Igf2 cluster and ,thus, the H19 Cluster is not activated. Imprinted disorder is a result of various abnormalities in linked Kcnq1 and H19/Igf2 clusters, such as, loss of Cdkn1c , upregulation of Igf2 etc. One of the imprinted disorder is Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, it is caused by the maternal allele behaving like a paternal allele. Since paternal allele have active Igf2, the quantity of Igf2 increases ,which is a growth regulator ,and the Cdkn1c level decreases, which is a growth inhibitor.this may lead to excessive growth, Cancer. This is due to mutation/ deletion to cause loss of imprinting, Uniparental disomy, two copies of one parental chromosome, and Epigenetic disruption for loss of imprinting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA approved drug which targets the DNA methyltransferses(DNMT1), it is used for the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome progressed to acute myeloid lymphoma . It inhibits the DNA methylation on the whole which leads to non suppressing of tumor suppressor cells but also may lead to various other side effects due to hypomethylation in all the cells. These drugs irreversibly binds to the DNA of the  methyltransferases and therefore multiply along with them. Since it is not target specific ,it has long term effects on normal cells. The actual mechanism is still not clear , and trials are still done for many other tumors including solid tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The nucleoside analogues binds irreversibly to the DNA methyltransferases, they are replication dependent and hence can have enduring effects on the epigenome. The sensitive period here refers to the pre implantation period of the embryo to early post implantation , and the primordial germ cells stage all the way to production of mature eggs and sperms. The sensitive periods of development invovle three generations i.e., mother carrying a foetus during the production of mature eggs or sperms. this period is not advisable for any treatment o medications because it might affect the foetus and the coming up next generation which is not good. </p></div>
