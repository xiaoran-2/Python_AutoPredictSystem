    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that involves methylation of 5’ group of (C)ytosine followed immediately by (G)uanine (CpG dinucleotides). It occurs in CpG islands( these are CpG dinucleotides clusters and often occur in promoter regions), Intergenic regions and Repetitive elements</p>
<p>Methylation of CpG islands result in silencing of gene expression and therefore acts as an inactive genetic mark. Keeping CpG islands free of methylation helps normal cells maintain passageways for gene expression open and free from obstruction. In cancer, disruption of DNA methylation of CpG islands occurs as  Locus Specific DNA hypermethylation. This hypermethylation profile is particular to each tumor subtype. This ultimately leads to silencing of Tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells function in maintaining genomic stability and integrity. The DNA methylation in intergenic regions is responsible for silencing cryptic promoters.  In Repetitive elements, DNA methylation like in intergenic regions maintains genomic stability.  Disruption of DNA methylation in above regions leads to what is called Genome wide DNA hypomethylation. This is known to be the earliest epigenetic aberration found and occurs to some extent in all types of tumors that have been tested and eventually progress into tumorgenicity. The consequences of hypomethylation depend on the location in the genome. This disruption in the DNA methylation of repeats/intergenic regions contributes to the genomic instability which includes illegitimate recombination between repeats. It also leads to the activation and transposition of repeats. Here repetitive elements make copies of themselves and jump and attach to any part of the genome which results in instability. The activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes also occur. Although the role of DNA methylation and its outcome is context dependant, its contributions to cancer are both Tumor suppressor hypermethylation and Genome wide hypomethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism which leads to monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression of a sub-set of genes in the genome. During gametogenesis, parental alleles are marked differentially by DNA methylation.  Imprinted genes occur as 1Mb clusters throughout the genome; controlled by regions called Imprint control regions (ICR).</p>
<p>For normal development, correct imprinting is necessary whereas defective imprinting is associated with disease. Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs can result in hyper or hypomethylation.   Such defective imprinting  has been linked to cancers. An example is Wilms’ tumor which is associated with H19/IGf2 cluster.  In normal cells containing H19/IGF2 cluster, maternal allele is unmethylated at ICRs and binds with insulator protein CTCF. This non methylated status prevents activation of IGF2 promoter gene by enhancers present downstream and activates H19 gene. Conversely, paternal allele ICR is methylated which prevents the binding of the CTCF protein and allows the activation of IGF2 via the enhancers while the H19 promoter is silenced due to hypermethylation. In Wilms’ tumor, there is a loss of imprinting (hypermethylation) of maternal allele. This results in the over expression of IGF2 and stimulates cell growth. This disruption can contribute to the formation of tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent that is clinically used to treat Myelodysplastic syndromes. It is a Nucleoside analogue and is classified as a DNA methyltranferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It inhibits the function of DNMT that otherwise maintain a methylated status in the gene. Such methylated status can contribute to the silencing of genes (e.g. tumor suppressor genes) and in turn result in the development of cancer cells.  DNMT incorporates itself into the DNA upon replication and therefore, replication dependant. Decitabine functions by irreversibly binding itself to these DNA incorporated DNMTs.  This results in re-expression of the abbrently methylated genes (tumor suppressor genes) in cancer cells and therefore contributes to anti-tumor effects.  In other words, Decitabine helps in the DNA demethylation of genes previously silenced by DNA methylation (hypermethlyation).  It is only required in low dosage to produce anti-neoplastic/tumor effect along with low toxic side effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark which is mitotically heritable. Alteration of this mark results in epigenomic disturbance such as silencing or over expression of a gene. An example is development of tumor cells (due to silencing of tumor suppression genes). Since DNA methylation is important for viability of cells it is important to maintain correct methylation patterns. This usually happens during a period called “Sensitive period” where epigenome marks are reprogrammed (removed/re-established).  These include Primordial germ cell development and Preimplantation &amp; postimplantation periods. According to Dr. Baylin’s research, a combination of epigenetic drugs slowed tumor growth in some people while it resulted in good reaction to subsequent chemotherapeutic drugs in others. He speculated that these drugs change tumor cells in a way that lead them to be more responsive to standard treatment. It is possible that epigenetic changes took place which can help a cancer stop without killing all its cells. These changes are passed on to daughter cells via cell division until it reaches the point where it is erased; sensitive period.  Therefore, it is inadvisable to treat patients during these sensitive periods as it may remove the useful epigenetic marks the drug lays down. </p></div>
