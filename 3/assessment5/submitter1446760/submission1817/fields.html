    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an essential part of the epigenetic structure of a genome, and associated with CpG dinucleotide expression.  CpGs are normally found clustered together near gene promotors, and are unmethylated in a normal cell, which correlates with gene expression.  If CpG islands are methylated in a normal cell, however, this correlates with gene silencing, as it enables to be recruited to maintain dense chromatin.  Intergenic and repetitive elements are also methylated in a normal cell, which is believed to contribute to maintaining the stability if the geome and silences repeat sequences that can interfere with normal cell function.  In neoplastic (cancer) cells, the opposite of all these functions occurs:  CpG islands are often hypermethylated, which leads to gene silencing, but it is often tumour suppressor genes that are silenced, leading to an altered cell cycle, which can disrupt appropriate cellular apoptosis and DNA repair.  There also appears to be hypomethylation at the intergenic and repetitive elements, potentially allowing the cell to produce proteins not needed for normal cell function.  In summary, we find locus-specific hypermethylation at CpG islands, leading to silencing of tumour suppressor genes which alters the cell cycle, and genome wide hypomethylation, leading to a loss of imprinting and genomic instability.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of gene imprinting, and is dependent on the maternal and paternal alleles working together to contribute to a cell's normal function.  In the maternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) of the H19 gene remains unmethylated, allowing CTCF (an insulator protein) to block the genetic enhancers downstream of the Igf2 gene from accessing it and instead promotes H19 expression in the cell.  On the paternal allele, the ICR of the H19 gene is methylated, which results in the silencing of H19 expression, and the enhancers are then able to access and express Igf2 from the paternal allele.  The production of the functional protein from each gene is balanced in this way.  In Wilm's tumour, however, it has been observed that commonly the ICR of the H19 gene is [hyper]methylated, which results in bialleic expression of Igf2, and complete silencing of H19 protein.  Igf2 is a known oncogene, which can result in uncontrolled growth promotion, which is a key characteristic of neoplastic cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are two main classes of drugs actively being used to act on the epigenome in cancer cells: histone-deacetylase inhibitors, and DNA-demethylating agents.  Decitabine belongs to the later class, and specifically inhibits DNA methyltransferase, leading to hypomethylation of the DNA.  In vitro studies suggest that decitabine-induced hypomethylation may help restore normal function of the genome in neoplastic cells by allowing the expression of genes critical to maintaining the cell cycle, differentiation and prolieferation of the cells, as epimutations are reversible.  It seems to target rapidly dividing cells preferentially, making it an excellent chemotherapeutic agent as this is often a characteristic of neoplastic cells, whilst normal cells divide at much slower rates.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Appropriate DNA methylation is crucial to maintaining normal cell function, as it helps regulate gene expression and appropriate gene silencing for each particular cell type.  We also know DNA methylation is heritable, which helps maintain genomic stability.  Sensitive periods in cell development refers to the times  in cell development that can disrupting the epigenetic reprogramming, altering DNA methylation and hence the potential function of the cell.  These periods are during pre-implantation development of an organism (i.e. embyro development or pregnancy), and during germ cell development (reproductive life stage).  And changes instituted by chemotherapeutics or by other means during these times would mean that respectively, all cells would then carry the same epigenetic alteration as it is mitotically heritable, and that and epigenetic alteration could be passed onto future generations, particularly in regards to its affect on gene imprtingin, allowing the potential for more rapid deterioration of a normal cell into an abnormal/neoplastic cell.</p>
