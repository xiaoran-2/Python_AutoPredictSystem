    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">DNA methylation is a process by which a methyl group (CH3) is added to a cytosine. It is associated with silencing gene expression, and occurs at CGI, intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">CpG islands (usually unmethylated):</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">There are 2 methods by which this process leads to silencing at CpGs:</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">1.  meCpG bind proteins called MeCP1/2, which condense chromatine or recruit other factors to do it. When chromatine is compacted (heterochromatine), transcription factors cannot acces there, so transcription is avoided.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">2. In this case, methyl group directly acts as a physical barrier, blocking the transcription factors to bind and preventing transcription as well.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">In both cases, no transcription means no proteins synthesised, so the gene isn’t expressed.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">If DNA methylation suffers epigenetic aberrations, it can result in cancer. The most outstanding abnormality at CGI is DNA hypermethylation. As the word says, it consists in overlevels of methylation, causing too much silencing. If tumor supressor genes are silenced, it easily leads to cancer. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">Intergenic regions and repetitive elements (usually methylated):</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">In these zones, instead of preventing transcription, the main function of methylation is maintaining genetic integrity. In the case of intergenic regions, it is achieved thanks to Dnmt1, that mantains methylation levels. Sometimes, cryptic transcription start sites are also silenced as well. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">If methylation is disrupted and DNA hypomethylation occurs, stability gets out of control and it results in abnormal karyotype: deletions, insertions, translocations…</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">In the other hand, what repetitive elements do is that they “cut and paste” themselves into other places in the genome. Methylation here is in charge of silencing those repeats to prevent ilegal transpositions. As in intergenic regions, an abnormality in methylatoin leads easily to instability and consequently, in diseases.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">Imprinting is a phenomenon by which a gene is expressed in a parent-of-origin specific way, and related to DNA methylation. It is controlled by ICRs and the way they work differs by locus.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">An interesting example is the H19/Igf2 cluster, an enhancer blocking located in human chromosome 11.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">There is a protein called CTCF able to insulate Igf2 cluster from enhancers.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">In the maternal allele (no methylation), CTCF acts properly so enhancers cannot reach Igf2, so they bind a nearer cluster, the H19. Then, Igf2 results inactivated.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">On the other hand, the patternal allele does have DNA methylation at ICR, so CTCF cannot bind and Igf2 isn’t insulated. Then, enhancers easily reach them and it results activated.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">The problem begins with imprinting disruption and causes diseases like Beckwith Syndrome, due to Igf2 upregulation. It can come from mutations/deletions or 2 copies of one parental chromosome, that result in the maternal allele acting like the paternal one. Then, there is an over dose of lgf2, which function is to promote growth during gestation. Specifically, it stimulates cell proliferation in many organs, like kidney, where precisely, the Wilm’s tumor takes place. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, commercialized as Dacogen, is a drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It belongs to the epigenetic inhibitors group of DNA demethylating agents, like another similar drug called azacitidine.</p>
<p>The main function of decitabine is to hypomethylate DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p>This way, it induces a re-expression of aberrantly silenced genes and restores its normal activity. Consequently it can be so usefull to reactivate som tumour-supressor genes, which are the ones that stop the uncontrolled cell growth that results in cancer.</p>
<p>This drug, along with other types of inhibitors, has shown a great impact and very good results affecting the metyhilation, and is now a great hope in the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According to Dr Stephen Baylin, altering DNA methylation may have enduring effects. As the article says, this is not so strange. DNA methylation and epigenetic modifications in general, are stable epigenetic marks, which means they are mantained during DNA duplication. In the case of methylation, it is laid down by transferase DNMT1. So, until they aren’t actively erased, these changes keep passing to daughter cells.</p>
<p>That’s why epigenetic drugs can be very effective even after the treatment.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are some periods when these drugs should be contraindicated. They are the so-called sensitive periods: intervals of time of developing where epigenetic marks are removed rather than mantained.</p>
<p>Logically, these sensitive periods must be the ones of the developing of the embryo where a restoring of totipotency is needed: primordial germ cell development, and pre-implantation/early post-implantation of the embryo.</p>
<p>The reason why treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable has something to do with the fact that in thess periods, a huge reduction of DNA methylation level occurs. So it’s dangerous to have an even bigger demethylation caused by the drug, as it could provoque serious DNAhypomethylations and lead to disease.</p></div>
