    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a biochemical process where a methyl group is added to DNA by DNA methyltransferases. It’s a mitotically heritable trait that helps maintain genomic stability and is associated with gene silencing when found at promoters. It's associated with a number of key processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, suppression of repetitive elements and carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>DNA methylation occurring at CpG islands causes condensation of chromatin and also stops transcriptor factors from binding resulting in silencing of genes. DNA methylation in intergenic regions functions to maintain genomic integrity, silence cryptic transcription start/splice sites. At repetitive elements it functions to maintain genomic stability by silencing repeats, preventing transposition.</p>
<p>Aberrant DNA methylation patterns (hypermethylation and hypomethylation) have been associated with many cancers. Global hypomethylation has been implicated in the development and progression of cancer; this is the earliest epigenetic abnormality observed in cancer and is genome-wide. It results in chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting. Hypomethylation has consequences that depend on its location. At the intergenic regions it results in genomic instability due to deletions, reciprocal translations and insertions of genetic material into the genome as a result of illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition. There may also be activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. Hypomethylation at CpG poor promoters causes oncogene activation and can lead to cancer e.g. R-RAS oncogene in gastric cancer.</p>
<p>Later on there is locus specific DNA hypermethylation. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. At the CpG islands and CpG island shoes this hypermethylation causes inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and there is also loss of imprinting at the ICRs (Imprinting Control Region) these may result in the uncontrolled division and growth of tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal chromosome ICR (Imprint control region) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated so it’s paternally imprinted as the DNA methylation imprint is on the paternal chromosome. The maternal cluster is unmethylated. CTCF cannot bind to the ICR on the paternal chromosome as its blocked by the methylation (enhancer blocking) so the downstream enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and promote its expression from the paternal allele. Conversely H19 (a long non coding RNA) is expressed from the maternal chromosome, due to enhancers acting on it, as the CTCF acts as an insulator for maternal Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>A common feature of cancer cells is loss of imprinting. So genes that should be expressed mono-allellic in origin are either expressed or silent from both alleles. Loss of imprinting is observed in many tumor types in pre-neoplastic tissue and may be due to ICR hyper/hypomethylation.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor there is loss of imprinting, there is hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele as well leading to expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele leading to double dose of Igf2 compared to normal genome. Igf2 is growth promoting and this is associated with Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, is a DNA-demethylating or hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Decitabane can only be incorporated into DNA strands (unlike Azacitidine which may be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains).</p>
<p> Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, wherebone marrow produces misshapen unhealthy blood cells, where it helps the body produce normal blood cells and kills abnormal cells in the bone marrow.</p>
<p>Decitabine’s anticancer effects are thought to be twofold. One mechanism is via demethylation of DNA, here it interferes with the methylation of DNA and allows normal function is restored to tumor suppressor genes thus restoring control over unregulated cell growth. It is also a antimetabolite that causes a direct cytotoxic effect on rapidly dividing cells  resulting in their death.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and can be passed from parent cells to daughter cells as they divide, so the epigenetic marks are copied so that the same expression profiles are expressed resulting in the same phenotype and function. So by altering the DNA methylation (with drugs etc.) you inadvertently alter the expression of the genome they are mitotically heritable characteristics.</p>
<p>The sensitive period describes certain time frames in development where the genome is more likely to be influenced from internal and external sources. This is the case during early development, primordial germ cell development as well as later stages of specific differentiation, another is when the patient is pregnant. At these points in time there is a large amount of activity occurring within the cells especially with regards to DNA and the genome and errors here can have a large influence on the life form.</p>
<p>Treating patients during these sensitive periods can adversely affect them as they are more susceptible to the drug’s effects and may develop iatrogenic complications as a result of this susceptibility, leading to long term damage to their genetic material.</p></div>
