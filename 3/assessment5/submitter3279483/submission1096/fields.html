    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Promoter CpG islands are normally unmethylated regardless of whether the promoter is active or inactive. As such, non-cancerous CpG islands form an exception from the association of methylation of promoter regions with suppression of gene expression. In cancer cells, however, CpG islands are frequently hypermethylated; this leads to silencing of the gene linked to the respective promoter. By this epigenetic mechanism, tumour suppressor genes can be silenced in cancer cells. CpG island hypermethylation is particularly found in cancers of the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP); though which CpG islands are hypermethylated differs between specific cancers. </p>
<p>In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated, but become hypomethylated in cancer cells. In normal cells, genome-wide methylation helps to ensure genomic stability (i.e., prevent loss, addition, or faulty recombination of chromosomes) by packing chromosomes into denser heterochromatin. Consequently, hypomethylation of repetitive elements (and intergenic regions in general) in cancer cells allows for illegitimate recombination of chromosomes that lack this dense packaging. In addition, repeats that lack methylation can become active and thus produce copies of themselves which can be transposed into other parts of the genome. In summary, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells can lead to genomic instability involving deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster has an imprinted control region (ICR), which is unmethylated on the maternal allele, but methylated on the paternal allele; it is thus paternally imprinted. The unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele is bound by an insulator protein, CTCF, which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Consequently, these enhancers can act on a long non-coding RNA, H19. In turn, H19 is expressed from the maternal, but not the paternal allele. This is an instance of chromatin looping: as the preference of the enhancer - acting on Igf2 - is blocked by CTCF, the second choice of acting on H19 prevails. In contrast, the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated, and thus CTCF cannot bind; consequently, the enhancers act on Igf2. Furthermore, methylation spreads from the ICR to H19, which is thus silenced.</p>
<p>Igf2 is an oncogene which is upregulated in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which underlies Wilm's tumour. This occurs due to appearance of two paternal-like alleles and loss of the maternal-like allele; i.e., both alleles express Igf2, which promotes tumour growth. Imprinting can be lost due to mutation or deletion; but uniparental disomy can also mean that both chromosomes are inherited from the father.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methylation inhibitor. A nucleoside analogue, it is incorporated in the DNA of tumour cells during DNA replication. It prevents further methylation of DNA by irreversibly binding and thus inhibiting methyltransferases. Consequently, genes that have been methylated and silenced aberrantly can be demethylated and become active again. As such, Decitabine can be used to counteract hypermethylation of tumour-suppressor genes. As these become demethylated and can be expressed again, they act to suppress tumour growth. Because nucleoside analogues are replication-dependent, cancer cells - which replicate much faster than other cells - are particularly affected by Decitabine.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable; i.e., it is sustained through mitosis in somatic cells. Alterations to DNA methylation thus persist and spread to daughter cells. Though epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are largely stable, there are sensitive periods during which the epigenome undergoes active remodelling and can be broadly influenced by environmental factors (including drugs). These periods are during primordial germ cell development and the pre- and early post-implantation phase. During these periods, reprogramming is not limited to specific parts of the genome and affects the entire epigenome; thus the epigenome is most sensitive to environmental impacts. During these periods, drugs that alter DNA methylation would likely lack in (treatment) specificity and broadly affect the makeup of the epigenome as a whole; which would make it difficult to target them to specific sites.</p></div>
