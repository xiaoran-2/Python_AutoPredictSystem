    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to

    <div class="field-value"><p>One consistent feature in cancers is the presence of abnormal DNA methylation.  DNA methylation primarily occurs at cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide sequences in DNA.  CpG islands are clusters of CpG dinucleotides concentrated in gene promoters.  They are usually unmethylated, but methylation of these CpG islands serves to silence the promoter, and expression of the gene.  In cancer cells, CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppresor genes tend to be hypermethylated, silencing their expression.  This removes an important check on cell growth and contributes to the growth of the cancer.</p>
<p>DNA at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is usually hypermethylated, which aids in maintaining genomic stability by silencing cryptic transcription start sites in intragenic regions and by silencing repeats to prevent deleterious effects such as transposition, transcriptional interference, and illegitimate combination.  In cancer, genome-wide (but particularly intergenic region and repetitive element) hypomethylation is found.  This increases genomic instability by activating repeat sites, allowing for illegitimate recombination and transposition.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The disruption of imprinting has been shown to contribute to cancer.  One example is the influence of the H19/Igf cluster in Wilm's tumor.  The H19/Igf2 cluster has differentially imprinted paternal and maternal alleles.  In the paternal allele, DNA methylation at the imprint control region(ICR) blocks CTCF from binding.  This methylation spreads to the promoter of the H19 gene, silencing it.  Downstream enhancers access and activate the Igf2 gene.  In the maternal allele, the ICR is left unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind, which blocks downstream enhancers from accessing the Igf2 gene.  This silences the Igf2 gene.  With its promoter left unmethylated, H19 is expressed.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, hypermethylation of the ICR of the maternal allele blocks CTCF from binding and silences the H19 gene.  Downstream enhancers activate the Igf2 gene.  In other words, the maternal allele acts like a second maternal allele.  This completely shuts down H19 expression and doubles Igf2 expression.  This Igf2 overexpression contribute to Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One drug affecting epigenetics that has already been FDA-approved is Decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  Overall, it would inhibit DNA methylation by inhibiting the action of DNA methyltransferases.  In tumours which are primarily dependent on hypermethylation of the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, Decitabine would inhibit the methylation of these promoters and enable these tumor suppressor genes to be expressed, helping to suppress tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One promising avenue of combating cancer is the prospective development of epigenetic drugs.  These drugs could produce long-lasting effects on the patient's epigenome. When a DNA is replicated, two hemimethylated DNA molecules are created.  During maintenance, DNA methyltransferases recognize hemimethylated DNA and methylate the other strand to match.  In this way, DNA methylation patterns persist among a cell's progeny.<br />There are certain "sensitive periods" of development when the epigenome is most sensitive to environmental effects.  Epigenetic marks are "reset" by removing and then laying down methylation.  Two identified sensitive periods in development are the pre-implantation blastocyst stage and the production of primordial germ cells.<br />It would be inadvisable to treat patient with drugs that affect DNA methylation during sensitive periods as the patient's DNA at these points are particularly sensitive to epigenetic manipulation at this point.  The drugs could cause widespread haphazard changes in methylation of the patient's DNA which would proceed to be passed on to the progeny of those cells, perhaps creating a variety of undesirable effects.<br /><br /></p>
