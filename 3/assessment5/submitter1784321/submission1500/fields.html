    <h1>Submission 1500 from Anon (session_user_id: 3e924c9fce4637c8b0a5700d07e9e15e89fca6b7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is classified as antimetabolite and DNA-demethylating agent and is <span>used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. It works is by demethylation of DNA, where normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. It also works as antimetabolites, these are very similar to normal substances within the cell so when the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells. These two processes contribute to anti-tumour effects.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands is altered in cancer. CpG islands are the promotors os tumour supressor genes, so normally CpG islands are hipomethylated, with the repetitive elements, intergenic region and the gene methylated, allowing the tumour suppressor to be expressed. In cancer, CpG islands may be methylated and the repetitive elements, intergenic region and the gene are unmethylated, leading to lack of expression of the tumour suppressor gene and the possibility of disease (cancer).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, so the enhancer will act on Igf2 because the CTCF 2 is not binding the methylated ICR, allowing the Igf2 to be expressed. Now, in the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, so CTCF 4 can bind the ICR, allowing the enhancer to act on H19 and the Igf2 will be silent (unexpressed). 
Disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster leads to Wilm's tumour.  The ICR of the maternal allele will be hypermethylated, so you'll have expression of Igf2, like in the paternal allele, leading to disease, because Igf2 is growth promoting and normally is only expressed in the paternal allele.</div>
