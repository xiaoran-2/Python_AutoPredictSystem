    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands, DNA sequences of about 1<span>-</span>2 kb that are (C+G)-rich and do not have the typical underrepresentation of CpG seen in vertebrate genomes (a much lower CpG frequency than predicted for a random sequence of that base composition), are found in about 60% of promoteres and are not inversely correlared with gene expression. Promoters have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. In cancer promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes, and silencing of the underlying tumor suppressor gene. Another target of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer are CpG island shores, defined as approximatela 2 kb regions surrounding CpG islands. </p>
<p>When they overlap promoters, CpG islands are usually, constitutively unmethylated in normal tissues. Frequent and extensive hypermethylation of certain CpG islands is observed in a very wide variety of cancers. In a study of methylation of almost 1200 unselected CpG islands in 98 primary cancers (breast, colon, brain, head and neck, testicular, neuroectodermal tumors and acute myeloid leukemia) by restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS) of<em>Not</em>I/<em>Eco</em>RV fragments, it was estimated that an average of <span style="font-family:symbol;">~</span>600 of <span style="font-family:symbol;">~</span>45 000 CpG islands in the genome are hypermethylated in cancer <em>vs</em> control tissue with a maximum of <span style="font-family:symbol;">~</span>4500 and a minimum of 0. Among the tumors with the highest frequency of CpG island hypermethylation were colon cancers.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. In cancer they tend to be unmethylated (hypomethylated), so that the imprinting is lost. Alterations in the DNA methylation at ICRs (hyper- or hypomathylation) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a member of a new class of drugs known as DNA "demethylating" agents.  Methylation of DNA is a major mechanism that regulates gene expression in cells.  When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth.  When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold.   One way that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites.  Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hyper- and hypomethylation at the <em>IGF2-H19</em> imprinting control region (ICR) result in reciprocal changes in <em>IGF2-H19</em> expression by preventing the binding of the insulator protein, CTCF. </p>
<p>The ICR at <em>IGF2</em> and <em>H19</em> is normally methylated on the paternal allele. Methylation is excluded from the maternal allele by CTCF binding. The presence of CTCF confers an insulator function upon the ICR, which blocks access of the <em>IGF2</em> promoters to the enhancers downstream of the <em>H19</em> gene. This function is lost on the methylated paternal chromosome and this enables <em>IGF2</em> expression by allowing the promoters to access the enhancers.</p>
<p>In Wilms tumour, allele loss at 11p15.5 has been shown to be specific for the maternally inherited allele, the significance of which is demonstrated by the pattern of imprinting of genes within the region of common allele loss. In particular, the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene (<em>IGF2</em>) is maternally imprinted (paternally expressed), and so maternal allele loss leads to either no change in effective gene dosage, or to increased gene dosage if there is associated paternal duplication. Two neighbouring genes, <em>H19</em> and <em>p57<sup>KIP2</sup></em>, are paternally imprinted. Mutation or deletion of the maternally inherited copy of these genes therefore results in loss of all active gene function circumventing the requirement for mutation of the retained paternally inherited copy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation may be viewed as a secondary mechanism involved in carcinogenesis. Chemicals or drugs can transform normal cells into frank carcinomas. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. </p>
<p>The <span class="yellowFade">sensitive</span> period is a phase during the development. According to Montessori's <span class="yellowFade">sensitive</span> period hypothesis, humans go through a number of <span class="yellowFade">sensitive</span> <span class="yellowFade">periods</span>, during which they are <strong>particularly receptive to certain types of stimuli (such as drugs)</strong>. Montessori believed that the emotional, intellectual, physical and social <span class="yellowFade">development</span> of children could be enhanced by providing the right kinds of stimuli during particular <span class="yellowFade">sensitive</span> <span class="yellowFade">periods</span>.</p>
<p><span class="yellowFade">Sensitive</span> <span class="yellowFade">periods</span> are transitory, lasting only a few months or a few years. During each <span class="yellowFade">sensitive </span>period, a human naturally will focus his or her energy and attention on one or more particular types of interaction or stimulus. If the human is in an environment that enhances the quality of those interactions, he or she will learn more efficiently and to greater effect. A human still can learn the relevant skills once a <span class="yellowFade">sensitive</span> period has passed but will tend to have more difficulty doing so.</p></div>
