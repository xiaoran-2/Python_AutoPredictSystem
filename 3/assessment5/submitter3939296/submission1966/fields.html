    <div class="field-value"><p>cpg islands in normal genes are methylated in those genes that need to be silenced, in cancer the cpg methylation patter will be different cuz genes that form part for apopsosis or something will suffer methylation in order to get silenced, but those genes that promote cell proliferation con tumor cells will be de-methylated or suffering hypomethylation in order to get transcribed and translated. This much is known: most CpG sites have been lost from mammalian genomes during evolution, but about 1% of human DNA consists of short areas where CpG sites have escaped depletion<span style="font-size:11px;line-height:0px;">. </span>Most of the remaining CpG sites are normally methylated in adult cells. About half of all genes have a CpG island in their promoter region, and this gene configuration is what has recently attracted the most attention. Most promoter CpG islands are normally unmethylated, regardless of the expression state of the associated gene. However, in silenced areas, such as the inactive X-chrom-osome in females and the silenced allele of imprinted genes, promoter-associated CpG islands are generally methylated, and this methylation is essential for maintaining the silenced state. Mechanisms regulating the establishment of methylation remain poorly understood, but the consequences of CpG island methylation are becoming increasingly clear. <span>Nevertheless, the presence of CIMP shows that all methylation events are not equal, and that DNA methylation does not necessarily follow malignant transformation. Rather, the subset of tumours with intense methylation is probably formed, in part, through changes in cell physiology resulting from epigenetic silencing.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Differentially methylated regions are associated with many imprinted genes. In mice methylation at a DMR upstream of the </span><em>H19</em><span> gene known as the Imprint Control region  is acquired in the male germline and influences the methylation status of DMRs 100 kb away in the adjacent Insulin-like growth factor 2 </span><span> gene through long-range interactions. In humans, germline-derived or post-zygotically acquired imprinting defects at IC1 are associated with aberrant activation or repression of </span><em>IGF2</em><span>, resulting in the congenital growth disorders Beckwith-Wiedemann  and Silver-Russell syndromes, respectively. In Wilms tumour and colorectal cancer, biallelic expression of </span><em>IGF2</em><span> has been observed in association with loss of methylation at a DMR in </span><em>IGF2.</em><span> This DMR, known as DMR0, has been shown to be methylated on the silent maternal </span><em>IGF2</em><span> allele presumably with a role in repression. The effect  </span><em>IGF2</em><span>DMR0 methylation changes in the aetiology of BWS or SRS is unknow. <span>DMR0 and IC1 have opposite susceptibilities to global hyper and hypomethylation during tumorigenesis independent of the parent of origin imprint. In contrast, during embryogenesis DMR0 is methylated or demethylated according to the germline methylation imprint at the IC1, indicating different mechanisms of imprinting loss in neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
