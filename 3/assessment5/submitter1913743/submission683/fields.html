    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally CpG islands are hypomethylated, so in general there isn’t methylation in these areas. Thus tumour suppressor genes are silenced.</p>
<p>During cancer, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than normally. Methylation in these areas is increased (hypermethylation) in a locus specific manner. DNA methylation at CpG islands progresses with time, so as the cancer progresses, we get increased methylation at CpG islands associated with tumour supressors. There are several examples of individual genes affected by this.</p>
<p>This disruption can lead to cancer because in general the hypomethylated CpG islands are located in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, so silencing these genes. The silent inactive state is locked in because an epigenetic state is mitotically heritable. This can be rapidly selected for because a cell has a competitive advantage when a tumour suppressor gene is silenced, so over time the cells with this epimutation are more likely to divide more rapidly or not die as much, so they take over.</p>
<p>Normally the genome in general is methylated in the repetitive elements and the intergenic regions. The normal function of DNA methylation in these regions is to maintain genomic stability, so to prevent loss or gain of chromosomes, or have illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes where they shouldn’t occur.</p>
<p>During cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This happens early, and increases with time. Hypomethylation most commonly occurs at repeats.</p>
<p>This disruption leads to disease by illegitimate recombination between repeats (e.g. reciprocal translocations between two different chromosomes). Normally repeats would be heavily methylated and heterochromatinised, so alignment of the repetitive regions would be less likely than when hypomethylated. Disruption can also occur due to activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes, as well as deletions and insertions. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele so CTCF cannot bind to the insulator element. The enhancers act directly on IGF2 and cause its transcription, and the H19 gene is not transcribed.</p>
<p>The imprint control region is unmethylated on the maternal allele. This means that CTCF can bind to the insulator element, and the enhancers (found further upstream), can act on the H19 gene. This means that IGF2 is silent on the maternal allele and there is no expression.</p>
<p>Wilms tumour is a childhood kidney tumour. Imprinting is disrupted in this disorder, by hypermethylation of the imprint control region. This means that the region is methylated on both the maternal and paternal alleles.</p>
<p>Because the imprinting control region is methylated on both alleles there is expression of IGF2 from both. This leads to a double dose of IGF2 in comparison to a normal cell. IGF2 is growth promoting, and excessive IGF2 is associated with Wilms tumour. Loss of imprinting is an early event in cancer development, and often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue, so before it develops into a full tumour. This suggests that changes in the imprint control regions could be very early events in tumorogenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is an enzymatic epigenetic regulator, specifically a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. The drug contains a neucleoside analogue, so becomes incorporated into the cells’ DNA during replication. When DNA methyltransferase1 then binds to the neucleoside to copy the pattern of methylation to the daughter strand, it (DNA methyltransferase1) is bound irreversibly and cannot be released. The drug results in DNA methyltransferase1 depletion and DNA hypomethylation; thus the epigenome of daughter cells is hypomethylated compared to parent cells. The action of DNA methyl transferase inhibitors is division dependent, as the cell needs to be replicating for them to work. Cancer cells are more severely affected by them than normal cells, because they can replicate more often. Decitabine works best at lower doses; at high doses they are toxic. At low doses they have an anti-neoplastic effect, effectively killing the faster dividing tumour cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so daughter cells inherit the pattern of DNA methylation of the parent cell. If a DNA methylation pattern is altered, this is inherited in daughter cells; this new pattern could then replace the old if the cell with the altered epigenome has a survival advantage. Sensitive periods are times of active re-modelling of the epigenome (removal and laying down of different epigenetic marks). Sensitive periods of development in mammals are: the period between primordial germ cell development through to mature egg and sperm production; the pre-implantation and early post-implantation period; brief periods when tissue specific differentiation for organ development occurs. During these periods the epigenome is most sensitive to changes in the environment. It is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because at these times the epigenome is undergoing active re-modelling and is re-laying and altering the pattern of epigenetic marks. Drugs that target the epigenome could have more wide ranging effects during this period on the entire epigenome and genome than during non-sensitive periods, and could affect all tissues rather than targeting specific areas. This could result in further disorders throughout the organism or death.</p></div>
