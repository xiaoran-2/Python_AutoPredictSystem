<h2 class="hg-tinymce-code">      <span style="color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:20.4px;"> DNA methylation refers to the addition of a methyl group (-CH3) to some cytosines in genomic DNA. In mammals typically happens at CpG sites. Methylation patterns are maintained through cell division by the enzyme Dnmt1.</span></h2>
<h2 class="hg-tinymce-code">       Cancer is essentially a genetic disease arising from a series of germ-line and/or somatic DNA changes. DNA methylation involves a covalent modification of DNA and has been found to influence a variety of processes that affect DNA integrity and function. The multiple observations linking DNA methylation to cancer <span style="color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:20.4px;">can be resolved in a model proposing that the high rate of mutation at CpG residues is due in part to methyltransferase-facilitated deamination.</span></h2>
<h2 class="hg-tinymce-code"><span style="color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:20.4px;">       Promoter CpG island hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is an epigenetic hallmark of human cancer commonly associated with nucleosome occupancy and the transcriptional silencing of the neighboring gene. Nucleosomes can determine the underlying DNA methylation status. DNA methylation can determine nucleosome positioning. Most importantly, the establishment of a stable cell line that restores DNMT1/DNMT3B deficiency shows that nucleosomes reoccupy their positions in de novo methylated CpG islands.</span></h2>
<h2 class="hg-tinymce-code"><span style="color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:20.4px;">       CpG island hypermethylation has been described in almost every tumor type. Many cellular pathways are inactivated by this type of epigenetic lesion: DNA repair (hMLH1, MGMT), cell cycle (p16(INK4a), p15(INK4b), p14(ARF)), apoptosis (DAPK), cell adherence (CDH1, CDH13), detoxification (GSTP1), etc em leader.</span></h2>
<h2 class="hg-tinymce-code"><span style="color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:20.4px;">       The majority of methylated CpG islands were shown to be in intragenic and intergenic regions, whereas less than 3% of CpG islands in 5′ promoters were methylated. The CpG islands in all three locations overlapped with RNA markers of transcription initiation, and unmethylated CpG islands also overlapped significantly with trimethylation of H3K4, a histone modification enriched at promoters.</span></h2>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><h2>      Genomic imprinting is associated with allele-specific DNA methylation. In mouse embryos that are deficient in the DNA    methyltransferase (<em>MTase</em>) gene, the expression of <em>H19, Igf2,</em> and <em>Igf2r</em> is altered such that the normally  imprinted paternal allele of <em>H19</em> is activated, and the  normally expressed paternal allele of <em>Igf2</em> and the expressed maternal allele of <em>Igf2r</em> are repressed. These results suggest that a normal level of DNA methylation is required for the differential expression of imprinted genes. Similarly, in Wilms’ tumor, alterations in the allelic expression of IGF-II and  <em>H19</em> are usually associated with abnormal patterns of DNA methylation. Interestingly, the increased    expression of <em>Igf2</em> was primarily derived from the activation of the normally imprinted maternal allele, with the normally expressed paternal allele also remaining active.</h2>
<h2>      Normally, the <span class="geneSymbol">IGF2</span> gene undergoes genomic imprinting and only the copy inherited from a person's father is active.  In some cancers, however, both the paternal and the maternal copies of the gene are active, increasing the amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 that cells can produce.  An increased amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 may stimulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells from being destroyed.</h2>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><h2>  Decitabine (DAC) is cytidine azanucleoside analog with clinical activity in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and potential activity in solid tumors.</h2>
<h2>  Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine  incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine.</h2></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><h2>     Histone proteins are subject to a diverse range of post-translational modifications which, along with DNA methylation, play a major role in controlling gene expression, cell division, survival and differentiation. Alterations in these chromatin modifications are thought to contribute to important human diseases including cancer. Inhibition of the enzymes that introduce and remove these chromatin modifications is proving an effective approach to cancer therapy and inhibitors of histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases have been approved for use in haematological malignancies. </h2>
<h2>     Although DNA methylation is involved in normal development, aging and gene regulation, altered methylation patterns have been associated with disease. It is generally believed that early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms.</h2>
<h2>     Treating patients during sensetive periods is important, because using these drugs may have not results directly in the disease but in their chemotherapy drugs. the tumor becomes more sensitve to the chemotherapy.</h2></div>
