<ol><li> DNA methylation is the backbone for many epigenetic events in the cell,for example,in DNA imprinting,inactivation of X chromosome,heterochromatin formation,etc.It is generally ,inversely proportional to genexpression,i.e.more the methylation less the gene expression.This is kept highly conserved at Genome wide level,CpG islands and histone levels.generally CpG islands, which are present in 60%of promoters(cis), are kept in a methylation free state, in spite of gene activity in normal cells</li>
<li>Disruption of this state ,by hypermethylation of CpG islands, lead to silencing of underlying genes,  eg,tumour suppressor genes,which could form one of many hits in Knudsen's tumorogenisis hypothesis, leading to cancerous transformation,which is observed very frequently in many tumours,which often progress with time.Since these are heritable marks, can be used as bio markers to differentiate tumour cells from normal cells,for eg,CIMP(CpG island hypermethylation  at promoters) in colorectal cancers.,as also as prognostic indicators,eg,more the hypermethylation,poorer the prognosis.</li>
<li>Intergenic region and repetitive elements in normal cells are maintained in a state of genome wide hypermethylation, leading to normal gene expression  as well as  controlled expression of growth factors ,like,tumour suppressor factors giving rise to normal cell  growth and maturation</li>
<li> In cancer, there is genome wide hypo methylation of intergenic region and repetitive elements ,leading to genomic instability,eg.abnormal recombination between repeats, leading to deletions,insertions,translocations, mutations(eg.DNMT3 mutation leading to ICF syndrome) or oncogenic activation at CpG promoters ,leading to aberrant or over expression of growth promoting genes or silencing of tumour suppressor genes,progressing to cancer.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.Normally,paternal imprinting of ICR cluster of H19/IgF2,seen with methylation of IgF2 locus, preventing binding CTCF,allowing expression of IgF2 by enhancers.Concomitant ICR repression of paternal H19 locus leads to silencing H19 expression.</p>
<p>2.Maternally expressed H19 is unmethylated,which binds insulator protein CTCF, leading to expression of H19, over IgF2 expression.Methylation of H19 locus, blocks CTCF binding leading to silencing of H19 gene expression, allowing enhanced expression of IgF2.</p>
<p>3.Wilm's tumor,an embryonal tumor,often seen in Beckett Weidemann syndrome , an uniparental disomy disorder, where loss of imprinting of maternal allele of ICR H19/IgF2 cluster on Chr.11,leads to double dose of paternal imprint causing over expression of IgF2 and decrease in tumor suppressor factor cdkn1c,expressed by H19 .leading to tumor formation.</p>
<p>4.Loss of methylation of imprints at ICR H19/IgF2 locus,  due to abnormalities or mutations on both maternal and paternal allele can lead to various disease,including embryonal cancers,brain abnormalities,,as seen in Beckett Weidemann and Prader William syndrome,due to over expression of growth promoters(IgF2) or loss of tumor suppressor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.Decatabine belongs a class of DNA Demethylating (DMLT1 inhibitor)drugs on trial for treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome.</p>
<p>2.These tumours,due to presence of mutations, over express an enzyme,EZH2, which causes histone methylation,leading to silencing of genes surrounding it,  which include tumour suppressor genes involved in prevention of tumor formation and controlled cell growth.this drug prevents the process of methylation of these histone marks leading to decrease or loss of EZH2 enzyme expression and thereby,expression of tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>3.Decatabine acts by getting into DNA nucleotide upon replication and whenDNA methyl transferase(DMLT1) comes to bind that nucleotide to copy methylation to daughter strand, DMLT1 irreversibly binds to the inhibitor , preventing replication.Since cancer cells are the most actively replicating cells, they are the once which are severely affected, thus bringing about tumour suppression. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Stephan Bailing's study showed that combining Histone deacetylase inhibitor with DNA Demethylating agents bring about slowing of tumour growth in some advanced solid tumours, which showed good response to routine chemo therapeutic agents, later on. This could be due to altered epigenetics on tumour cells, herited by their progeny, making them susceptible to chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Epigenetic reprogramming occurs in early gestation when,methylation state is maintained within the cell at definite periods of cell development, which is referred to as sensitive periods.</p>
<p>These periods are during early embryonic development and during primordial germ cell development,when epigenetic marks , which generally regulate factors necessary for normal cell growth, maturation and differentiation,are completely erased from both maternal and paternal alleles and then reappear later, during reprogramming ,which then get fixed,permanently and are then inherited by the progeny of both somatic cells and gametocytes and   thus gets passed on to the subsequent generation.</p>
<p>Epigenetic drugs given during this sensitive periods can lead prevention of reprogramming and resetting of epigenetic marks, the absence of which can lead to acquiring altered growth characteristic of the tumour cells, making them more aggressive in their behaviour and also resistant to not only epigenetic drugs but also, chemo therapeutic agents.</p></div>
