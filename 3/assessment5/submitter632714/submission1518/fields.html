    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands which are found in 60% of promoters regions tend to be free of DNA methylation, which is important as methylation of the promoter region negatively correlates with gene expression. i.e. Any methylation of these regions reduces gene expression. However in cancer cells the CpG islands become hypermethylated causing the silencing of the underlying gene. Tumour suppressor genes are typically silenced as a result of these hypermethylations. Such examples include silencing of RB gene in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer, BRCA1 in breast cancer and MGMT in colorectal tumours. <br />     <br /> DNA methylation at intergenic intervals maintains genomic integrity. Methylation also plays a role of cryptic silencer and splicer. e.g. Prevention of transcriptional interference. At repetitive elements methylation also maintains genomic stability. It also silences repeats which prevent transpositions as well as preventing transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and preventing illegitimate recombination’s. As there are many of these repeats, methylation results in compaction of chromatins and thus recombination becomes much harder. So the primary role of methylation is to protect genome from transposable elements. Now during cancer hypomethylation (i.e. reduction in methylation) occurs which results in genomic instability. Through hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions illegitimate recombinations occur between repeats as well as activation of repeats and transpositions and activation of cryptic promoters and thus disruptions to neighbouring genes. It has been observed that karyotype of cells without Dnmt1 are hypomethylated, have been subject to abnormalities such as deletions, reciprocal translocations or insertion. Also mutations in DNMT3b results in ICF syndrome and genomic instability as a consequence.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>    H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated on maternal allele and methylated on paternal allele and thus paternally imprinted, as DNA methylation imprint is on the paternal chromosome.<br />     When the imprint control region is unmethylated as in the  maternal allele it is bound by a protein called CTCF which is an insulator protein. CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers on the maternal allele. On the paternal allele when the imprint control region is methylated the CTFC can no longer bind and thus downstream enhancers can act on Igf2 and promote its expression from the paternal allele. Thus Igf2 is paternally expressed and its imprinting. <br />     Now the reason that the H19 is no longer active on the paternal allele is due to heterochromatin spreading (DNA methylation spreading). The DNA methylation on the paternal allele is spread downstream on to the H19 promoter<br />     These 2 clusters can be disrupted by loss of Cdkn1c (tumour suppressor) and upregulation of Igf2 (growth promoting). Thus through over expression of Igf2 growth promoting gene, tumours such as Wilm's tumour is developed.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome which fall under the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors class of epigenetic inhibitors. Decitabine hypomethylates the DNA by inhibiting DNMT. It is a nucleoside analogue drug which in incorporated into the DNA upon replication. When the DNMT1 comes to bind and copy the nucleotide onto the daughter strand DNMT is irreversibly bound to the DNA.</p>
<p>  Their action is division dependent which means for cancer cells which divide far more rapidly than other cells are severely impact by this hypomethylation. At high doses they are not very effective at treating cancer and are in fact toxic. However at lower doses they do have a very good anti-neoplastic effect, as they cause DNA-demethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Studies have shown that epigenetic changes could be acquired to the DNA through diet and environment, as well as being passed from parent to child and  one generation to the next. Thus methyl group and methylation can be increased or decreased by disease, environmental exposure or life experiences, passed on through generations.</p>
<p>Sensitive period are periods when altered environment can influence epigenetic control. For mammals this the period from primordial germ cell development to production of eggs and sperms is one such period.Another sensitive period is pre-implantation and early post-implantation, which are both periods of active remodelling of genome.</p>
<p>So the period where epigenetic marks are removed and laid down at different places in the genome are when we are most sensitive to the changes to the environment, and at these periods treating the patients will be inadvisable as the epgenentic marks will be laid down in the genome and any possible changes to DNA methylation through hypo or hyper-methylation will be permenant.</p></div>
