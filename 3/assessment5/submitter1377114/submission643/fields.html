    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to silencing of gene expression. The primary way this occurs is by the formation of a condensed chromatin structure. Methylated CpG binding proteins cause the chromatin to be tightly packed, inhibiting gene expression. A secondary mechanism is by blocking transcirption factor binding, which alters gene expression. DNA methylation does not occur at CpG islands in normal cells. In cancer cells, this is reversed, and CpG islands now display methylation. The purpose of DNA methylation in cancer cells is to silence tumor suppressor genes. When these tumor suppressor genes are inhibited or silenced, this allows the normal cells to develop into neoplasia and eventually invade the bloodstream, where they are carried to other parts of the body to proliferate. </p>
<p>In normal cells, DNA methylation is found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This maintains genomic integrity and protects the genome from transposable elements. DNA methylation at these sites serves to prevent transposition, avoid transcriptional interference, and prevent incorrect recombination. DNA methylation is mutagenic. Hypomethylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions brings about genomic instability in cancer. Hypomethylation progresses with time and most commonly occurs at repeats. During transcription in cancer, these repeats and intergenic regions misalign and cause an illegitimate recombination because they are not densely packed into heterochromatin. In addition, activation of repeats could cause disruption in DNA by jumping around the genome. In cancer, there are a number of abnormalities that could result from genomic instability including deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations. To sum up, genome-wide DNA hypomethylation leads to genomic instability.</p>
<p>Different tumors have different dependencies. Some tumors proliferate by tumor suppressor hypermethylation and some are driven by genomic instability caused by hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repeats. Therefore, DNA methylation is context dependent. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is unmethlyated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. Therefore, the cluster is paternally imprinted. When the ICR is unmethlyated on the maternal allele, it is bound by the CTCF insulator protein. CTCF insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. Because Igf2 is blocked, the enhancers are able to express H19 on the maternal allele. On the paternal allele, CTCF does not bind due to DNA methlyation, thus allowing Igf2 to be expressed by the downstream enhancers. Without CTCF binding, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter and silences its expression. Therefore, Igf2 is expressed only on the paternal allele. </p>
<p>Methylation of ICRs has different effects depending on the mode of action of the ICR. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, there is a hypermethylation of the ICR, allowing Igf2 expression on the maternal allele. Because of this Igf2 overexpression, there is a loss of imprinting, which is a common feature of cancer. Indeed, Wilm's tumor is marked by an abnormally large abdomen resulting from nephroblastoma.</p>
<p>To conclude, DNA hypomethylation or hypermethylation at ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. This leads to cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used for the treatment of myeleodysplastic syndromes, a class of conditions where certain blood cells are dysfunctional. <span>Myeleodysplastic syndrome is a precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia. Some cancers are caused by mutation of enzymes that are overactive, increasing the amount of DNA methylation. This causes histones to be methylated more than they should be. This hypermethylation silences surrounding genes, including tumor-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. </span></p>
<p>Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, which returns the overactive enzymes to a normal state. This allows the tumor-suppressor genes to be turned on again and do their job, which is inhibiting tumor growth. </p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mechanism and is passed down during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until it is actively erased. Once the marks are erased, they do not return. Therefore, an epigenetic drug could be produced that could alter DNA methylation in a tumor cell without affecting normal cells. In other words, epigenetic therapies could inhibit cancer growth without destroying normal cells. </p>
<p><span>A sensitive period is when there are major epigenetic changes in the cell that are occuring, which lay the groundwork for the future phenotype of the individual. The most sensitive epigenetic periods in a developing human is </span>during embryogenesis and gametogenesis, when marks are established rather than maintained. This early development is when epigenetic reprogramming occurs, and importantly epigenetic marks are reestablished post-implantation.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because there are constant ongoing epigenetic changes in the cells and introducing a foreign drug could cause a negative or unanticipated effect. During this development, the body is fragile and vulnerable to environmental changes. Once the patient is more developed, then a drug would be more useful because the body is stronger and more able to withstand any negative consquences. </p></div>
