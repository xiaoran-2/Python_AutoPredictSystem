    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the best studied epigenetic modification that can go wrong in the case of cancer is DNA methylation. Methylation of cytosine within CG dinucleotide is linked to gene silencing. Although CG combination is quite rare in the genome, some gene promoters contain high frequency of CG streches - named CpG islands - and expression of those genes can be downregulated by methylating CpGs. However, in normal cells those CpGs usually stay unmethylated and genes expressed. Locus-specific DNA hypermethylation of CpG island and even broader CpG shores is found in cancer to silence tumor supressor genes, this type of turning off genes can occur even more frequently than mutations. Some examples include RB in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal and BRCA in breast cancer. Because pattern of methylation is rather specific in can help diagnose tumors with more details than only mutation analysis.</p>
<p>Unlike CpG islands intergenic regions and repetitive elements are mostly methylated in normal conditions to avoid unwanted recombination and transposition as well as transcriptional interference, in that way maintaining genomic integrity. Global hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repeats leads to genomic instability and is the feature found in all cancers ever studied.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Although genome-wide DNA hypomethylation is present to some degree in all cancers, local hypermethylation can be present not only on CpG rich promoters but also on imprinted loci. One of the examples is H19/Igf2 cluster, where in normal cell imprint control region (ICR) is unmethylated on maternal allele allowing an insulator protein CTCF binding in a way that blocks Igf2 expression and allows H19 production. The methylation of ICR on paternal allele disrupts CTCF binding and evokes exactly the opposite situation with Igf2 being expressed and H19 silenced. In abnormal cancerous cells hypermethylation of H19/Igf2 ICR causes excessive methylation on both alleles giving rise to overexpression of growth promoting Igf2. This case is characteristic for Wilm's tumours - cancer of the kidneys that typically occurs in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Discovery that not only genetic but also epigentic changes influence cancer development opened up new possibilities of treating cancer, while epigenetic alterations can be reversed more easily. For instance, hypermetylation of imprinted and tumour supressor genes can be prevented by inhibiting DNA methyltranferases. One of such DNA-demethylating agents - Decitabine - is already on the market. One issue of drugs that affect epigentic processes is that they do not have any specificity, in the case of Decitabine - reducing methylation generally, theoretically also inducing hypomethylation of genomic areas that can be dangerous when unmethylated. However, in clinical trials epigenetic drugs have surprisingly mild adverse effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One positive side of using drugs interfering with DNA methylation is that changes can be passed on to daughter cells, promoting long lasting effects that stay after treatment, because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. While manipulating epigenetic state of somatic cells turned out to be relatively safe, there are periods of development when such global interference might have disastrous consequences. There are two stages in development when previous epigenetic marks get erased and new ones are laid down, it happens in early embryo development before implantation and during germ cell development. These two periods are called sensitive because cells at these stages are very susceptible to slightest epigenetic changes and influencing these processes can cause unwanted and fatal results.</p></div>
