    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG islands, which are often found at promoters of genes, tend to be protected from methylation and are therefore not methylated in normal tissue. As methylation at CpG islands is associated with silencing of gene expression in normal tissue, genes which have unmethylated CpG islands are expressed. In cancer cells by contrast, CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated which then causes silencing of the underlying genes. Especially in cancer these alterations in DNA methylation at CpG islands can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes. When tumor suppressor genes are silenced due to these methylated CpG islands, this can result in an uncontrolled growth of tumor cells.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells. They are silenced in order to prevent transposition, to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and to prevent illegitimate recombination. In cancer these methylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated, which means they lose their methylation and become unmethylated. This can result in overexpression of growth promoting genes as well as in genomic instability. With genomic instability illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes can occur.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele the imprinted control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated which prevents CTCF from binding. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence it and because of that enhancers can access Igf2 to activate it. Therefore Igf2 is expressed on the paternal allele. On the maternal allele by contrast, the ICR remains unmethylated allowing CTCF and its cofactors to bind. This interaction mediates enhancers blocking allowing downstream enhancers to access H19 promoter. Therefore the maternal allele expresses H19 but does not express Ifg2.</p>
<p>The Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome results from imprinted disorders in linked Kcnq1 and H19/Igf2 clusters. While due to the loss of Cdkn1c in the Kcnq1 cluster the growth is no longer suppressed the disrupting imprinting in H19/Igf2 cluster leads to growth promoting. In Wilm’s tumor for example both the maternal and paternal allele is methylated at the ICR in the H19/Igf2 cluster. As a result, CTCF could not bind on both alleles and because DNA methylated spreads to the H19 promoter, H19 is also not expressed in both alleles. Instead enhancers can access Igf2 to activate it on both alleles. As Igf2 is an oncogene, the overexpression promotes tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent which means it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. As haematological malignancies are dependent on tumor suppressor hypermethylation, especially on hypermethylation of the CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes, Decitabine induces DNA demethylation on these tumor suppressor genes. As tumor cells are dividing much faster than normal cells and Decitabine irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA and are therefore replication dependent, tumor cells are affected more by the DNA demethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks on the genome are transmitted during mitosis to the daughter cells which means these epigenetic marks are mitotic heritable. When the methylation of DNA is altered this can have enduring effects on the epigenome.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods in development are during primordial germ cell development and during early embryonic development. Within these so called sensitive periods all epigenetic marks are first removed and then reestablished. Treating patients during such a sensitive period can alter epigenetic makeup which leads, due to mitotic heritability, to an altered epigenetic state. As epigenetic marks may be transmitted transgenerationally, altering effects may have multi-generational effects and can therefore be transmitted from parent to offspring.</p></div>
