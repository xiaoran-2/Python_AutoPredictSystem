    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are normally found in the promoters of many genes. They use to be unmethylated so the genes can be actively transcribed, However, CpG islands can sometimes be methylated and this is almost universally synonymous with silencing of gene expression. Methylation at CpG islands is very important to regulate which genes are expressed in the different cell types. In general in cancer cells the CpG islands are likely to be hypermethylated. As they are normally found in the promoters of tumor supressor genes, methylation causes the silencing of these genes and this gives to these cells and their daughters (remember DNA methylation is mitotically heritable) a competitive advantatge. So these cells with the epimutation will divide more rapidly and not die as much as the normal cells and this can cause the development of a cancer. </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated. The functions of DNA methylation in intergenic regions are to mantain genomic integrity, because if they're not silenced, cells exhibit genomic instability for example through deletions, insertions, duplications or translocations; and to silence crytic transcription start sites. In the other hand, DNA methylation in repetitive elements prevents transposition, avoids transcriptional interference from strong promoters and prevents illegitimate recombination. In cancer cells both intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated and, in consequence, they can be transcribed and can be accessible (they switch from being heterochromatin to euchromatin). So these repeats will be able to align and illegitimate recombination could occur causing genomic instability. If repeats are activated, they can also transpose into another part of the genome and cause disruptions in the coding genes, activating oncogenes or inactivating tumor supressor genes. So this will lead to the development of cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, imprint control regions tend to be hypermethylated and they display loss of imprinting (genes become expressed or silenced in both alleles). One example is the H19/Igf2 cluster. In a normal cell, the imprint control region of the paternal allele is methylated and the insulation element CTCF cannot bind to insulate the region, and so the enhancers can act on Igf2 and enhance its expression. In the case of the maternal allele, it is unmethylated so CTCF can bind and insulate the region, so the enhancers will act on H19, enhancing its expression (Igf2 will be silent in this allele). In the case of Wilm's tumour, the maternal imprint control region is hypermethylated and Igf2 can be expressed, so you have double dose of Igf2 comparing to a normal cell. As Igf2 is a growth promoter, the cells can start dividing in a uncontrolled manner and so the patient can develop this type of cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is used to treat a myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myelogenous leukamia. This drug is incorporated into the DNA during replication, and when the DNA methyltransferase (for example DNMT1) comes along to bind to the nucleotides to copy the methylations to the daughter strand, it binds irreversibly and can no longer be released. In this way DNMT1 will be unable to methylate the DNA and DNA will become hypomethylated (remember this disease is characterized by hypermethylation of CpG islands). So the action of this drug only takes places if the cell is actively dividing (and so, replicating its DNA). The cancer cells divide more rapidly than most of the other cells of the body, and so they will be more severly affected by this drug and it will be easier to target the cancer cells more specifically. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, so the epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter cells until they are finally erased during some of the reprogramming periods (they're normally removed between generations). We define a sensitive period as a period of time during which epigenetic reprogramming takes places. In humans we find two different sensitive periods of development: the period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms and the pre-implantation and early post implantation period. Both of them are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome. Treating patients during this periods is inadvisable because the establishment of these new epigenetic marks in the DNA can be transgenerationally inherited, and so their children and even their grandchildren could inherit these changes (in the form of a phenotype or a pattern of gene expression) and become "epigenetically abnormal". This may lead to the development of some diseases during their childhood or even when they become adults. </p></div>
