    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation of the CpG islands (CGI) results in the silencing of gene expression (usually unmethylated). In cancer, tumour suppressor genes are silenced by CGI hypermethylation.</p>
<p>The role of DNA methylation  in intergenic and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity (mutation and/or silencing of repeats to prevent transposition). In cancer, we can see genome-wide hypomethylation. It results in genomic instability like illegitimate recombinatiuon between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, DNA methylation spreads from the CTCF (insulator protein) binding site to H19. Then the enhancers can reach Igf2 and activate the gene. On the maternal allele, the binding site of CTCF is hypomethylated. CTCF insulates Igf2 from the enhancers, which activate H19 instead of Igf2.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour you can see an upregulation of Igf2 (which is an oncogene). It's caused by the maternal allele. Loss of imprinting (mutation, deletion or epigenetic disruption) or paternal uniparental disomy leads the maternal allele to act like the paternal allele. There is an overdose of Igf2 (growth promoter) and loss of Cdnkn1c (growth suppressor, expressed in cis) which predispose to embryonic and childhood tumours (e.g. Wilm's tumour in the kidney).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor). It cause a DNA hypomethylation because during the replication of the DNA, there is no new methyl group epigenetic mark) attached to DNA. The drug needs the cell to divide to be effective. Tumor cells replicate much more than a normal cell, they are more sensible to the drug. The hypomethylation is noxious for cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If you disrupt the DNA methylation, It can cause genomic instability (deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions, transposition) which lead to cancer.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming. It's during early the development of the embryo and the primordial germ cells development.</p>
<p>If the epigenetic marks are not laid down during the sensitive period, It can result with infertility, embryonic mortality, increased cancer rate in the offsprings...</p></div>
