    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG island is hypomethylated its functions to inactive tumor suppressor genes. In a cancer cell, the CpG islands are methylated. There is a swap, in terms of where the DNA methylation is found. There is an increased methylation at the previously unmethlyated sites such as the promoter regions of a tumor suppressor gene. Increased DNA methylation results in the blockage of the activity of suppressor genes that regulate cell division and growth. When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated allowing and promoting cancer, loss of imprinting and causing genomic instability.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are to maintain genomic stability and to protect the genome from transposable elements. To make sure that genetically the genome was normal, didn't lose chromosomes, gain chromosomes or have illegitimate recombination between chromosomes when they shouldn't occur. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements and the intergenic regions results to illegitimate recombinations between repeats which results to reciprocal translocations between two different chromosomes. In a normal cell recombination wouldn't happen because the repeats would be heavily methylated and heterochromatized. In the context of cancer, hypomethylations of these repetitive elements or the intergenic regions causes alignment, misalignment, then illegitimate recombination occur because they are not densely packaged down into heterochromatin. Repeats can also be activated because of hypomethylation. Meaning they have the capacity to copy themselves and jump around the genome or transpose. Jumping around the genome disrupts the coding region of a gene and activate neighboring genes, which leads to transcriptional aberration in the surrounding region. The overall outcome is additional deletion in cancer, insertions or gaining parts of chromosomes and reciprocal translocation that leads to genomic instability. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal chromosome, the imprint control region, ICR, is methylated, hence CTCF binding sequence prevents CTCF from binding, CTCF is excluded, thus enhancers act on Igf2 promoter which results to Igf2 expression on the paternal allele. In the case of maternal allele, ICR was unmethylated, CTCF forms a chromatin insulator that blocks the enhancers from activating Igf2, hence enhancers act on H19, and H19 was expressed. </p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting or parental specific gene inactivation is seen in Wilms tumor. Chromosome 11 contains the genes Igf2, an autocrine growth factor and H19 which appear to act as tumor suppressor gene to control cell proliferation. These genes are reciprocally expressed with only paternal Igf2 and maternal H19 being active to balance cellular growth. Loss of imprinting of these genes occur in Wilms tumors. The maternal chromosome reverts to a paternal pattern of gene expression, with methylation at normally unmethylated locations upstream to the H19 giving a double dose of Igf2, hence gene switching off H19 expression. This result to the loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster. It no longer shows this imprint expression but rather they become either expressed from paternal allele or silent from both parental alleles.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a methylation-blocking drug that belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMT1). It is metabolized and phosphorylated inside the cell and then incorporated into DNA, where they are recognized by DNA methyltransferases, the enzymes responsible for DNA methylation. Increase DNA methylation results in the blockage of "activity suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth. When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing and promoting cancer. Decitabine function is to "reprogram" the network of chemical changes that affect the DNA of cancer cells. This reprogramming can alter the activity of critical genes in cancer cells that drive their growth and survival. Decitabine can effectively reset DNA methylation. </p>
<p>Low doses of Decitabine had antitumor effects. Treated cells showed decreased DNA methylation and reactivation of genes that affect tumor growth and cell death. The cancer cells were given a "new memory" and produced a "memory" antitumor response. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is essential during embryonic development and in somatic cells. Patterns of DNA methylation are in general transmitted to daughter cells with high fidelity. There are sensitive periods when environment has influence in epigenetic make up. The two major periods of epigenetic reprogramming throughout the genome are primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms. The second sensitive period is the pre implantation and early post implantation period. Both of these periods are periods of active remodeling of the epigenome. At these times of active reprogramming we have removal and laying down of epigenetic marks at different parts in the genome and these are the periods when we seem to be most sensitive to the changes in the environment.</p>
<p>Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable. Environmental factors can alter epigenetic make up and adult health due to mitotic heritablity of altered epigenetic state. Drugs could have genetic and epigenetic effects on the DNA methylation.</p></div>
