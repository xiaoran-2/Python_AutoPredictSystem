    <div class="field-value"><p>All of our cells contain the same genetic background. What distinguishes one cell from the other is the gene expression and DNA methylation is one of the mechanisms by which the cell controls it. DNA methylation occurs at a cytosine of aCpG dinucleotide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>CpG islands are regions composed of several CpG dinucleotides, normally found in the promoter of genes and are, in general, hypomethylated. When CpG islands of a promoter are methylated this leads to the silencing of that gene. DNA methylation can lead to the failure of transcription factor binding or the formation of a repressive chromatin structure, both leading to gene silencing. CpG islands are methylated in few promoters of specific cell types and on the inactive X chromosome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the other hand, DNA methylation is frequent at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In both cases, it is involved in maintaining genomic integrity. In the former, methylation silences cryptic transcription start sites or splice sites. In the later, it silences repeats to prevent illegitimate recombination, transposition and interference from strong promoters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cancer, there is a hypermethylation of CpG islands, leading to silencing of several tumor supressor genes and a cell that is prone to improper cell growth. CpG islands hypermthylation in cancer is more frequent than mutation and in some cases is tumor specific, thus being used as a  diagnostic tool. CpG island hypermethylation can also be used as a prognostic tool (methylation increases with progression) and target of anticancer drugs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition, in cancer there is a genome wide hypomethylation, and this includes the repetitive elements and intergenic regions. The hypomethylation leads to genomic instability due to illegitimate recombination, activation of transposons (disrupting genes) and activation of cryptic promoters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cancer methylation profile is changed and that leads to genomic instability and altered gene expression profile.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster contain the Igf2 gene,the imprinting control region (ICR), the H19 gene and the enhancers. The enhancers work forming a loop, preferentially looping to activate the transcription of Igf2 gene.</p>
<p> In a normal cell, ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele and is subject to the binding of a protein called CTCF. Its binding insulates Igf2 gene from the downstream enhancers, leading to silencing of that gene on the maternal allele. The enhancers than loop to their second preferred locus, the H19 gene, activating its expression. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and this inhibits CTCF binding. Enhancers loop to the Igf2 locus. H19 is not expressed on the paternal allele because the methylation from the ICR spreads to the H19 gene.</p>
<p>In Will's tumour, the cell has two alleles that behave as the paternal allele. They both have methylated ICRs. This way CTCF binding is disrupted in both alleles, allowing the action of the enhancers on Igf2 gene. This cells than have abnormal levels of Igf2, and Igf2 is an oncogene, it promotes cell growth, giving to the cell the characteristic phenotype of a cancer cell, abnormal growth.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor that act on the methylation process, inhibiting DNA methylation. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, which means it replace normal nucleosides during DNA replication. When DNMTs bind DNA they get irreversibly bound to decitabine. </p>
<p>During carcinogenesis, there is a global hypomethylation of the genome and a hypermethylation of CpG islands. The prevalence of each type of methylation pattern, as well as which promoters will get hypermethylated, varies from one type of cancer to another. Hypermethylation of CpG islands leads to silencing of tumor suppression genes. This way cancer cells can acquire their abnormal and fast cell growth. In a tumor where CpG island hypermethylation is prevalent, treatment with decitabine may reduce the methylation of the CpG islands, which would restore the expression of tumor suppressor genes. And in fact decitabine has been showing a great anti-tumour effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>DNA methylation is added </span></span></span><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span><em>de novo</em></span></span></span><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span> in the genome by DNMT3. When the cell divides, each daughter cell have one strand of DNA methylated and one strand unmethylated. DNMT1 than methylates the strand of the daughter DNA that was not methylated. This way the methylation pattern is maintained during cell division. Likewise, a mistake in the methylation profile will also be maintained during replication. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>The moments when the cell is actively remodeling the epigenome are known as sensitive periods. These are: (i) the period from the primordial cell development to the production of mature eggs and sperm; and (ii) and the pre-implantation and early post-implantation period. In addition, during specific tissue formation there are some particular sensitive periods. During this sensitive periods DNA is demethylated and methylated, and changes in the environment can alter this process. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>In cancer, the methylation profile of the cell is altered and drugs that act on methylation process can help to reestablish the normal profile. After that, DNMT1 can maintain the new pattern. However, the use of such drugs during the sensitive periods may have drastic effects as it would alter the establishment of the normal DNA methylation profile. </span></span></span></p></div>
