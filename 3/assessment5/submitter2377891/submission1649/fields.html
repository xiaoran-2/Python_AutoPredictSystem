    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint Control Regions (ICR) are important in cancer because many imprinted genes are involved in growth. Both DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation can differ in ICRs between normal and cancer cells. Both changes lead to the loss of imprinting and to the gene either being expressed from both parental alleles or silenced from both alleles.</p>
<p>The maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is normally unmethylated and lets the CTCF insulator element bind to the ICR. This blocks the enhancers, so they cannot act on Igf2 that will be silent. On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and does not allow the CTCF to bind to it. This allows the enhancers to act on Igf2, which is activated.</p>
<p>Wilm’s tumor is a specific childhood kidney tumor that expresses aberrant DNA methylation at this ICR. There is a loss of imprinting and hypermethylation of the ICR, which leads to the expression of both the paternal and the maternal allele of Igf2. This leads to double the amount of Igf2, which is growth promoting. So when the imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted, the tumor cells can grow faster.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating or hypomethylating agent, so it reduces DNA methylation. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which are precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p>CpG islands located at tumor suppressor genes are often hypermethylated in cancer, so by demethylating DNA at these loci, decitabine can reactivate tumor suppressor genes if they have been methylated into a silent state by the cancer cell epigenome. Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, this leads to the supressing of the growth of the cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the daughter cells will inherit the same methylation pattern as the parent cell. If this pattern is changed in some way by drugs, it can be persistent in the consequent cells if not changed again. This can mean, for example, that by changing the epigenome of cancer cells, the cancer can stop growing without all of its cells dying.</p>
<p>The epigenome is most susceptible to environmentally induced changes during sensitive periods. These are periods when epigenetic marks are being established. In mammals the most sensitive periods seem to occur in early development during embryogenesis and gametogenesis. There are also other sensitive periods sometimes called developmental windows, such as infancey, puberty, pregnancy and menopause.</p>
<p>If patients are treated with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods, these drugs might have unwanted affects. They might change epigenetic marks in other cells than the cancer cells and thus lead to unexpected consequences, such as other abnormalities.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are two important types of DNA methylation that differ between normal and cancer cells. There is locus specific DNA hypermethylation, especially at CpG islands, and genome wide DNA hypomethylation, especially at repeats and intergenic intervals. Both increase during the development of cancer and are very common in nearly all tumor types.</p>
<p>CpG islands are areas in the genome that have an unusually high CpG density. In a normal cell, the CpG islands are usually hypomethylated. In contrast, in cancer cells the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. Also their shores, 2kb downstream or upstream, tend to change their DNA methylation pattern accordingly. These changes contribute to cancer, because CpG islands are often found in tumor suppressor genes and when hypermethylated, the genes will be silenced and will not be able to suppress cancer cell growth. The location of these changes in the DNA methylation of the CpG islands varies by tumor type. It can be seen, for example in the MLH1 gene in colorectal cancer and BRCA1 in breast cancer.</p>
<p>The repeats and intergenic regions are normally heavily methylated and located areas of heterochromatin in order to maintain genomic stability. In contrast, in cancer cells they tend to be hypomethylated and lead to increased genomic instability which contributes to cancer. By opening up the chromating they become more accessible and illegitimate recombinations can occur. With hypomethylation the repeats can also be activated, make a copy of themselves and jump around the genome. In addition, their promoters can also activate other genes that contribute to cancer.</p></div>
