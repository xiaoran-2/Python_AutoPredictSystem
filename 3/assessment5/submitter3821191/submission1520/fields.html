    <div class="field-value"><p>  To understand how DNA methylation is altered in cancer, one must first understand the role of DNA methylation at the CpG islands, intergenic regions, and repetitive elements. The role of epigenetic marks in normal cells gives us a foundation for discovering the mechanisms behind cancer where contributions are made by both epigenetics and genetics of the individual. </p>
<p>  CpG islands (CGIs) are often located in the genome at promoters of genes, and are the sites where many transcription factors bind. As such they are generally protected from methylation, and, when they are (rarely) methylated the gene is silenced. DNA methylation leads to chromatin compaction, making the DNA inaccessible to the transcription factors. At the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation silences overexpression and promotes genomic stability by preventing transposition and recombination, and by helping to avoid transcriptional interference.</p>
<p>  In cancer, the normal epigenetic state is disrupted, and research has shown that CpG islands are hypermethylated, particularly at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. These growth suppressing genes are silenced, and the cells replicate without regulation. Conversely, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells tend to be hypomethylated.  Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are expressed rather than silenced, this leads to genomic instability (chromosomal translocations, insertions, deletions, and transcriptional interference). </p>
<p>  The balance between hypomethylation of CGIs and hypermethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is critical to the interplay between epigenetics and genetics in cell regulation. Abnormalities in either epigenetics can lead to genetic mutations, and vice versa. When these disturbances to the normal cell function occur in cancer, both epigenome and genome are affected. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>  Many imprinted genes are involved in growth regulation. A disruption of imprinting leads to either up-regulation of ongcogenes or down-regulation of tumor suppressors. At the H19/Igf2 cluster, disruption of imprinting leads to overexpression fo Igf2, a growth-promoter, in Wilm's tumor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  In a normal cell, the H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted, expressing Igf2 from the paternal allele. On the paternal allele, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated, and this methylation spreads to the neighboring promoter for H19, silencing it. Binding protein CTCF is blocked by DNA methylation, the downstream enhancers cannot act on the ICR or H19, so expression of Igf2 is enhanced. On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, CTCF will bind to the ICR, insulating it from the enhancers, while preventing Igf2 expression by blocking the enhancers. H19's promoter is unmethylated and expressed from the maternal allele. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the case of Wilm's tumor, hypermethylation of the ICR at the H19/Igf2 cluster results in a double dose of Igf2. The maternal allele now functions in the same manner as the paternal allele. The ICRs are methylated. CTCF won't bind to the ICR due to methylation, H19 is not expressed, and the expression of Igf2 is enhanced on both alleles by the enhancers. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is a FDA approved drug used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome which has progressed to AML. It is a small molecule inhibitor that binds to the epigenetic machinery. A nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into the DNA, it irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferase, reducing the amount of DNMT that is available to the cell to hypermethylate CGis and repetitive regions. Its incorporation into the DNA is replication dependent, so cancer cells are more severely affected as they are dividing more frequently than normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark and therefore mitotically heritable. Using drugs that affect DNA methylation has an enduring effect on the epigenome because the epigenome is passed from parent cell to daughter cells. For example, if DNMTi treatment prevents the hypermethylation of a CGI that is at the promoter of a tumor suppressing gene, the daughter cells would no longer express the gene that promotes overgrowth of cells.</p>
<p>The treatment of cancer using DNA methylation inhibitors would need to be very cautious around the sensitive periods, those times when the epigenetic marks are being re-programmed. The sensitive periods are during early embryonic development (not of particular concern when treating cancer patients) and during primordial germ cell(PGC) development. In young cancer patients, because DNA methylation is not specific enough in its effects, the concern is that the treatment through the use of epigenome-affecting drugs would lead to detrimental effect on the PGC development. </p></div>
