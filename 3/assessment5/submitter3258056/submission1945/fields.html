    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>in normal cells CpG islands are not methylated allowing free gene expression to occur</p>
<p>in cancer CpG islands are usually methylated (hypermethylated) but in normal cells CpG islands anre not (hypomethylated)</p>
<p>in cancer, methylation of CpG islands prevents access to the genetic material and thus disables expression of specific genes in those regions of DNA</p>
<p>Changes in methylation to DNA at ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth<br />restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>Such changes can be either over or under or over methylation, hypo or hypermethylation.</p>
<p>This causes uncontrolled growth, trough either growth promoters or lack of growth inhibitors</p>
<p>disruption to epigenetic material leads to - activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumour suppressors </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug used as a DNA-demethylating agent - DNMTi inhibitors - FDA approved</p>
<p>In simple terms it removes excessive methylation from CpG islands for example</p>
<p>If methylation is blocking growth supressing genes in cancer cells, removing the methylation would allow natural ene expression to suppress abnormal growth of cancer cells</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes (eg methylation) are passed on during cell division until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. Epigenetic therapies change "DNA packging" which stop a cancer growing even though may not kill all cancer cells.</p>
<p>effects on germ cells - possibly harmful - need to be assesed in young patients</p>
<p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>methylated region around H19 helps in imprinting control it also allows expression of H19 from maternal allele and Igf2 from the paternal allele</p>
<p>paternal IGF2 and maternal H19 genes are normally expressed </p>
<p>areas further from/adjacent to H19 are methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele</p>
<p>it is reversed in tumor, where paternal pattern of methylation of H19 promoter, IGF2 is turned on, and H19 turned off, this has effect of uncontrolled cell growth</p></div>
