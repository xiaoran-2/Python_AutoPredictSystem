    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>igf2 is in the Igf2-H19 imprinted cluster of genes, located in humans on chromosome 11p15.3.</p>
<p>if we look at the gene cluster:</p>
<p>Igf2genexxxxxxxxxxICRxxxxxxxxH19genexxxxxxxxxxenhancerxxxxxxenhancer</p>
<p>Igf2 gene codes for the "insulin-like growth factor2", very important during growth and development before birth.</p>
<p>ICR = imprinted control region</p>
<p>H19 encodes for a long non-translated RNA, later cut in micro-RNAs. It controls and restrains the cell-growth</p>
<p><strong>Paternal allele</strong> :</p>
<p>the ICR is methylated and DNA-methylation spreads to H19 promoter and silences it.</p>
<p>DNA makes a loop to bring the enhancers near Igf2-allele and Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p><strong>Maternal allele</strong> : </p>
<p>ICR is not methylated and the protein CTFC ( a transcriptional repressor) binds to the ICR. DNA can't make a loop anymore and Igf2 is not expressed. The enhancers promote H19 expression.</p>
<p><strong>Wilm's tumor</strong> :</p>
<p>Wilm's tumor is an embryonal tumor.</p>
<p>There is a loss of imprinting. A methylation of the maternal ICR prevent the binding of CTFC and the expression of H19. The enhancers have acces to Igf2 and there is syntheses of growth factor. Both alleles act like the paternal one.</p>
<p>This increased amount of growth-factor stimulates the growth of tumoral cells in embryo. Since H19 is not expressed, it can't restrain it. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.</p>
<p>It acts in reactivating  epigenetically silenced tumor repressor gene. We know that during cancer, there is an hypermethylation of the CpG islands and so an silencing of the genes for tumor repressor factors. This methylation is mitotically heritable.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleotide-analogue which incorporates to the DNA during the replication. The DNA methyl transferase will bind in an irreversibly way to this nucleotide-analogue and will not be released anymore. The enzyme won't be able to copy the methylation to the daughter strand. The DNA won't be methylated in the daughter cells.</p>
<p>Since Decitabine prevents the methylation of DNA at CpG islands, the genes for tumor suppressor factor can be expressed again and the factors help in the fight against cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA is methylated during embryonic life and then during the life, the DNA-methylation is mitotically heritable, from a cell to its daughters cells. If a drug prevents methylation during DNA-replication, cells won't be methylated during the life span .</p>
<p>During sensitive periods, embryonic life (after implantation of the blastocyst) and during primordial germ cell development, DNA-methylation occurs. </p>
<p>When not to take these drugs :</p>
<p>during pregnancy, DNA-methylation in the embryo genes will not be possible . The embryo dies and the woman miscarriages.</p>
<p>For both sexes, the methylation of the gamete DNA occurs during all its formation after puberty.  During drug traitment there is a high risk that imprinted genes and "normal" genes DNA are not methylated. The gametes will be abnormal and the wrong methylation transmitted to the offsprings.</p>

<p>tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or if you plan to father a child. You or your partner should not become pregnant while you are using decitabine. You should use birth control to prevent pregnancy in yourself or your partner during your treatment with decitabine and for 2 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor about birth control methods that will work for you. If you or your partner becomes pregnant while using decitabine, call your doctor. Decitabine may harm the fetus.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>-</strong>-The normal function of CpG islands is to silence gene expression.</p>
<p>The methylation can be associated with the formation of repressive chromatin structures.</p>
<p>The CpG act in binding proteins with a DNA binding domain and a transcriptional repression domain to alter gene expression.</p>
<p>They can also prohibit the binding of transcriptor factors. </p>
<p>They recruit factors that condense the chromatin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- In cancers,</p>
<p>there are  locus specific  hypermethylation at CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor factors. So they silence the genes for tumor suppressor factor. Hypermethylation induces a controle of the cell cycle, the apoptosis (cell death) and DNA repair. The hypermethylation varies from one cancer to another and varies during the evolution of the illness.</p>
<p>There is a loss of imprinting.</p>
<p>Genome wide, there is an hypomethylation at CpG .</p>
<p>These hypomethylation can be found at poor promoters inducing an oncogene activation, and at ICR  inducing a loss of imprinting</p>
<p>All these disruptions induce the growth of the tumor inhibition of any controle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>-</strong>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, methylation of CpG maintains the genome integrity and silence cryptic translation start sites or cryptic splice sites.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at repetitive elements avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters.</p>
<p>Methylation avoids mutation of the repeat meC in T ( spontaneous mutation)</p>
<p>Methylation may prevent illegimate recombinaisons.</p>
<p>The repeats have the capacity of making a copy of themself and jump around the genome, methylation prevents this to happen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- In cancer,  the loss of methylation induces an increase in abnormal karyotypes : deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, loss of chromatin</p>
<p>there are illegitimate recombinaisons between repeats because DNA is not densely packaged anymore.</p>
<p>The repeats can make copy of themselves and jump around the genome. It can result abnormal expression of genes (e.g. oncogenes) </p>
<p>there can be an activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p>
<p>Without  chromosome integrity, the cellular fonctions are disrupted. Some proteins are no more expressed, some are expressed in excess.</p></div>
