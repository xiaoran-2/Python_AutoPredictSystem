    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands function as promoter regions for gene transcription; normally, they are generally not methylated in order to facilitate this function.  The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to control gene expression by preventing gene transcription at these gene promoter regions, functionally turning a gene off when appropriate (e.g., during X inactivation or cell differentiation).  Normally, non-methylated CpG-islands also help prevent cancer by allowing the transcription of tumor suppressor genes.  In cancer, the CpG islands (and CpG island shores) are more likely to be methylated and to become more hypermethylated over the course of the disease, causing tumor-suppressor gene silencing and increased tumor growth, which contributes to disease progression.  In contrast, genome wide methylation is normal (e.g., methylation at repetitive elements and intragenic regions).  Methylation of repeats contribute to gene stability by silencing repeats in order to prevent genetic insertion and deletion mutations, transpositions that may result in illegitimate recombinations, and transcriptional interference from strong promoters (e.g., inappropriate downstream promotion).  Genes allowed to ‘jump’ locations or have their promoters become inappropriately active can lead to aberrant transcription errors.  Cancer results in gene instability, because of this decreased methylation of repetitive elements and intragenic regions (as demonstrated in human cancers and in mouse models of experimentally induced hypomethylation – e.g., DNMT1 deletion experiments.  This hypomethylation happens early in cancer and increases with time.  The resulting genetic instability increases disease progression by increasing mutations that are adaptively selected to increase tumor survival, growth, and metastasis.  Hypo-methylation of weak promoters, that are normally methylated, can also contribute to disease by activating oncogenes (e.g., R-Ras) or MicroRNA (e.g., miR21) that can reduce expression of tumor suppression genes (e.g., PTEN). The effects of DNA methylation on cancer is therefore context dependent.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="Default"><span>Imprinted gene disruption (i.e., loss of imprinting) is an early-onset cause of cancer growth through either hypomethylation or hypermethylation of growth controlling genes that results in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth facilitating genes.  In cancer, both parental alleles might be simultaneously silenced or expressed.  For example, the growth promoting insulin growth factor 2 (Igf2) gene is a paternally imprinted gene that is part of the H19/Igf2 cluster that normally expresses Igf2 when the imprinting control region (ICR) protein insulator CTCF and the H19 promoter are methylated preventing CTCF from binding and allowing igf2 enhancers  to reach the paternal Igf2 gene.  But Igf2 is normally not expressed from the maternal allele, because the lack of ICR methylation allows CTCF insulator binding which blocks Igf2 enhancement and enhances H19 expression instead, resulting in only one allele (the paternal) expressing Igf2.  In Wilm’s tumor cancer, however, there is hypermethylation on the maternal allele in addition to the paternal allele, resulting in enhanced Igf2 expression on that allele as well, causing overexpression of the growth promoting Igf2 gene.  This H19/Igf2 cluster imprinting disruption contributes to childhood kidney cancer by increasing tumor growth.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a non-specific small-molecule DNA-demethylating anti-cancer agent that inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) binding.  It is FDA approved for haematological malignancies that have progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is undergoing clinical trials for other malignancies including solid tumors.  It is a nuceloside analogue that irreversibly binds DNMT after it has been incorporated into DNA, making it replication dependent.  This later property is clinically important, because once a site is immune to methylation it should remain unmethylated across replication of the cell line.  Since AML and perhaps other tumor types employ DNA methylation to suppress tumor-suppressor genes at CpG islands, enduring demethylation of these promoter regions that target cancer’s most rapidly dividing cells is especially therapeutic (at an effective but low toxicity dose), in so far as demethylation at these regions can re-establish tumor suppressor gene transcription slowing the progression of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment, because DNA methylation has enduring effects on the epigenome via mitotic heritability.  After an epigenetic target molecule is methylated, that site’s methylation is reproduced in its daughter cells across the future cell line.  Since cancer is often the result of multiple genetic and epigenetic changes, an enduring drug-induced DNA methylation modification that dismantles one part of cancer’s epigenetic machinery (e.g., protein binding, growth, tumor suppression, or apoptosis), can make cancerous cells synergistically more vulnerable to other epigenetic (e.g., HDAC inhibitors) or traditional chemotherapeutic drugs. However, since present epigenetic drugs are non-selective, normal cells can also be negatively affected.  This is especially a concern during ‘sensitive periods’, when the epigenome is actively reprogrammed.  These ‘sensitive periods’ include the preimplantation and early postimplantaton periods of embryogenesis and the period of gamete development (from embryonic primordial germ cell development through gamete maturation).  Treating patients during these sensitive periods is inadvisable, because the long-term side effects (e.g., altered growth, differentiation, and fertility, for the treated individual and possibly his/her offspring) would likely outweigh any therapeutic benefit the drugs might have.</p></div>
