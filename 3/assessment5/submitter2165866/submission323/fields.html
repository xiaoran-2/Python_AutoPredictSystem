    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation controls the compaction of the chromatin, and thereby controls which genes are expressed and to what degree. Normally, the presence of methylation results in genetic stability, the ability of cells to differeniate and to multiply, and not to return to previous developmental stages. Methylation is necessary for survival. However, hypermethylation at the CpG islands can compact the chromatin structure too much, silencing the transcription phase of cell division and preventing some cells - such as some tumor suppressor cells - from developing.  This interference can be mitotically heritable, resuting in uncontrolled cell multiplication. Conversely, hypomethylation opens the chromatin up for transcription. This can directly cause excessive cell multiplication. Intergenic regions, which contain non-coding DNA, also contain promoters and enhancers and when these are incorrectly methylated, the instructions they give contribute to inappropriate activity in the cells in the region affected by those signals. <br />Methylation silences repeated elements, and thereby prevents misalgnment of chromosomes and their illegitimate recombination, and controls the activation of nearby genes. When these element are expressed so that incorrect or mismatched recombination is allowed to proceed, the cells can fail to function normally but continue to divide and multiply.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and allows an insulator to bind to it. This insulation prevents enhancers from reaching and  promoting growth of Igf2, which is an oncogene. Since enhancers are blocked from reaching this region, they instead act on the H19 production region and enhance production there (harmeless in this context).  The production of lgf2 (Insulin-like growth factor) is expressed by the paternal allele because the methylated ICR allows does not bind to the insulator, so the enhancers move beyond that to enhance the production of Igf2.</p>
<p>However, when a maternal allele does not regulate the methyl, the insulator will not bind and the maternal allele effectively becomes a second paternal allele by allowing the enhancers to move upstream to produce a dose of Igf2 in addition to the paternal dose, and to prevent expression of the tumor suppressor normally acting upstream of the ICR. Interference to the normal sequence can be caused by mutations in the gene, insertions or deletions, paternal uniparental disomy (where the child gets both genes from the same parent), or (rarely) altered epigenetic marks. When growth is either enhanced and/or tumor suppresion is absent, the result will be cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating drug. It inhibits the function of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT).  <span>Without </span><span>(DNMT), DNA replication produces daughter strands that are unmethylated and unregulated, which ultimately leads to uncontrolled cell growth. </span>Some<span> tumor suppressor genes are silenced by DNA methylation, so reducing the methylation would have the effect of allowing them to functionally suppress oncogensis.  </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some DNA methylation marks are mitotically heritable, so daughter cells will inherit them. When that happens, the methylation will continue for as long as the cell line continues - possibly for the lifetime of the organism. If treatment can be directed at altering these marks in a way that controls their expression, that effect will continue after the drug is no longer present. <br />Sensitive periods are times when the marks are being laid down or removed, and these changes must be made correctly to cause the cell to function as intended. During these periods of restructuring, the genome is particularly vulnerable to misalignment or mutation.  The bulk of the restructuring is during early develpment of the organism, and again at the development of germ cells because of the changes taking place - treatment would be directed at a "moving target". When the restructuring phase is completed, the maintenance phase will beging and specific loci will be more stable and easier to target.  </p></div>
