    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, there isn't much DNA methylation at CpG islands, allowing for CpG islands to play regulatory roles.  However, when DNA methylation does occur, it leads to a suppression of these regulatory roles, which can contribute to disease.  For example, DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer because the CpG islands are methylated, causing a suppression of the tumour suppressor genes, in which the CpG islands are found.  These tumour suppressor genes will not be effective, causing the rapid division and longevity of certain cells, which is a feature of cancer. The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is hypermethylation.  In cancer, however, the CpG islands in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.  This causes illegitimate recombination between repeats causing genomic instability, which causes cancer.  Obviously, the disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease because when these integenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, it leads to the illegitimate recombination between repeats, as mentioned earlier, the activation of repeats, the jumping around of repeats, and the copying of repeats.  These repeats may be able to disrupt the normal genetic code, causing instability and disease.  In addition, these repeats also are able to activate or disrupt neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The hypermethylation of ICRs, or imprint control regions disrupts imprinting in the genome.  When this occurs, instead of the normal monoallelic parental expression, the cell expresses either both of the alleles or neither.  For example, in the H19/Igf2 cluster, the methylation pattern of the paternal allele is a methylated ICR, which allows for Igf2 to be expressed because the CTCF is not insulating the ICR.  The methylated pattern of the maternal allele on the other hand is an unmethylated ICR, which allows for CTCF insulation and for the enhancers to work on H19, resulting in a suppression of Igf2 expression. In Wilm's tumour, a childhood kidney tumour, both ICRs from the two parental alleles are methylated, resulting in an expression of Igf2 both alleles.  This also means that H19 loses expression from both alleles.  A double dose of Igf2 can have bad effects, like disease, because Igf2 is growth promoting, causing the rapid growth of tumours, like Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that is sold as Dacogen and is classified as a DNA demethylating agent.  It helps to cure histone overmethylation, which is the cause of some cancers.  As a result of this, the tumour suppressor genes which had been previously methylated due to overmethylation are demethylated, allowing for the growth of the tumour to stop. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because it allows for certain genes to be replicated and others to be suppressed.  This influences what genes are expressed and what genes are not expressed.  A sensitive period is a period in which DNA methylation can be affected in the organism.  It is when the organism is developing.  The sensitive periods of development are: primordial germ development and the early development (pre-implantation development).  Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because giving a patient a drug while they are developing that affects DNA methylation could cause a host of problems, like the methylation of the wrong genes.</p></div>
