    <div class="field-value"><p>When a cell is cancerous, DNA methylation is reversed, with respect to a normal cell, at specific loci and in intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the genome. Such specific loci are CpG islands. They are generally not methylated in normal cells but are found more methylated in cancer cells. Since CpG islands are in the promoters of tumor-suppressor genes, the hypermethylation of CpG islands effectively silences these genes to increase the chance of tumor growth and contributes one hit to the Knudson-proposed multiple hits of cancer. Beyond CpG islands are the genome-wide intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which are generally methylated in normal cells. The methylation of these regions and elements is however depleted in cancer cells. The hypomethylation of these repeats and intergenic regions disrupts genomic stability and enhances tumorigenesis. Genomic stability in a normal cell means no illegal chromosome deletion, insertion or recombination. In normal cells, the repeats and intergenic regions are heavily methylated and heterochromatinized so that they are inactive, less similar to align effectively, and too densely-packed to facilitate recombination and thus maintain genomic stability. In cancer cells, because the hypomethylated repeats or their promoters can be activated, the active repeats can make copies of themselves, jump around the genome and disrupt coding regions of surrounding genes. These activities lead to transcriptional aberration such as extraneously deleting and inserting parts of chromosomes. In addition, the under-methylated repeats and intergenic regions of cancer cells are not tightly packed so that those elements can align or misalign and then recombine illegally and thus cause genomic instability. In summary, DNA methylation disruptions in a cancer cell can inactivate tumor-suppressor genes by hypermethylation and induce chromosomal instability by genome-wide hypomethylation. Determining which DNA methylation contributing to the cause of a cancer depends on which mechanism, tumor-suppressor deactivation or chromosomal instability, drives the tumor growth in that cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, genes have imprint control regions (ICRs) methylated in such a pattern that effects monoallelic expression specific to either paternal or maternal alleles. In cancer cells, the methylation pattern is disrupted either by hypermethylation or hypomethylation so that the ICRs lose their parent-specific origin and the genes are either expressed or silenced from both paternal and maternal alleles and affect cell growth. For example, in the H19/Igf2 cluster of normal cells the ICRs of the paternal allele are methylated and cannot bind to the CTCF insulator protein. Without CTCF blocking, enhancers can reach Igf2 to activate its expression on the paternal allele. Contrarily, the ICRs of the maternal allele are unmethylated and can bind to the CTCF insulator protein. CTCF binding blocks enhancers from reaching Igf2 and prevents Igf2 from expressing. In cancer cells like Wilm’s tumor, hypermethylation causes the ICRs of the maternal allele to be methylated. The CTCF insulator cannot bind to the methylated ICRs to insulate Igf2 from enhancers so that enhancers can activate Igf2 and allow it to express. Since Igf2 is growth promoting, a double dose of Igf2 from paternal and maternal alleles due to loss of imprinting increases tumor growth and contributes to the cause of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancers caused by epigenetic abnormalities can potentially be treated by drugs, like Decitabine, that reverse the epigenetic changes. Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Recurrent mutations of de novo methyltransferase3a (DNMT3a) in MDS suggest that DNA methylation disruptions like CpG island hypermethylation may contribute to the disease because mutated DNMTs cannot regulate methylation effectively (Hassler 2012). Decitabine probably targets DNMTs and other epigenetic machineries to restore the regular DNA methylation pattern and tumor-suppression function. Because Decitabine is a nucleoside analog, it is incorporated into DNA upon replication and irreversibly binds to DNMTs and changes the methylation pattern, which in turn is copied to the daughter strand. Decitabine does not selectively target cancer cells, but it can have anti-tumor effect by acting more on cancer cells through cell division and replication. Since cancer cells divide and replicate more rapidly than normal cells, cancer cells are affected by Decitabine more severely than normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation of epigenetic modifers can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because any epigenetic changes remain effective for the current cell’s life and are passed on to multiple cell generations through cell division. Because of the lasting effects of drugs targeting epigenetic changes, treating patients during sensitive periods of development would be inadvisable when epigenetic marks are erased and reprogrammed. The sensitive periods are pre-conception, embryonic development, and pre-puberty. Studies of in vitro fertilization suggest that during pre-conception male and female gametes may undergo some epigenetic changes essential for reproduction. Epigenetic marks are reprogrammed in the early embryonic period and are cleared and reset during the primordial germ cell development. Studies of environmental effects on epigenome suggest that during the slow growth period of pre-puberty maturing male and female gametes may go through some epigenetic changes. During these periods when epigenetic marks are forming, changes in environment such as the presence of DNA-methylation altering drugs can affect epigenetic marks that carry on through generations. Epigenetic therapy thus should be avoided during these sensitive periods.</p></div>
