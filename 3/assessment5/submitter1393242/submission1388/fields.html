    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In non-cancerous cells, DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression and stability of the genome.  Methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions is high while methylation of CpG islands at promoters remains low in normal cells. Conversely in cancer cells, methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions is diminished while methylation of CpG islands in promoters increases.   Methylation of repetitive elements of DNA is important for preventing recombination events between chromosomes and maintaining overall genetic stability of these regions. In cancer, decreased methylation of these repetitive elements results in increased mutations and chromosome translocations. Methylation of intergenic regions of active genes plays a role in the regulation of alternative splicing and transcription. Disruption of this intergenic methylation in cancer leads to a deregulation in tissue specific genes. Normally, promoter CpG islands are not methylated whether or not the genes of these promoters are active. In cancer cells, the CpG islands of promoters are hypermethylated. This results in the decreased expression of these genes, resulting in silencing of these genes. Overall, these changes result in the decreased expression of tissue specific and tumor suppressor genes and the overall disregulation of gene expression and genome stability which is beneficial for cancer survival and additional mutations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike other modifications in cells that alter gene expression, epigenetic marks are heritable between daughter cells. This means that cancer cells that are affected by epigenetic drugs will pass on these changes to further generations of cancer cells and also be additionally sensitive to cancer treatments. However, it would not be advisable to use these drugs on patients undergoing epigenetically sensitive periods, meaning periods at which the epigenetic state of cells/tissues is in flux. This would include during the production of gametes and the development/tissue specification of embryos. If during these sensitive periods, patients were treated  with drugs that modified epigenetic states, defects in imprinting may arise which would lead to many potential genetic diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruptions in imprinting can also contribute to cancer.  Once example of this is the H19/Igf1 cluster. Normally, methylation occurs at the paternal locus of H19. This results in the repression of the paternal H19 gene but the expression of the paternal Igf2 gene. Conversely, no methylation of the maternal H19 locus results in the expression of the maternal H19 gene and the repression of the maternal Igf2 gene. However, in Wilm’s tumor, this imprinting is disrupted. Bothe maternal and paternal copies of the H19 gene are methylated. This results in no expression of H19 and increased expression of Igf2. Igf2 is a growth factor leading to aberrant tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drug Decitabine, a DNA-demethylating agent, is sometimes used in the treatment of cancer. Use of this drug results in less DNA methylation and can lead to changes in gene expression. In cancer cells, the CpG islands of promoters are hypermethylated. This results in the decreased expression of these genes, resulting in silencing of these genes. Overall, these changes result in the decreased expression of tissue specific and tumor suppressor genes. By reducing DNA methylation with Decitabine, restored expression of tumor suppressor genes may result, thus having an anti-tumor effect.</p></div>
