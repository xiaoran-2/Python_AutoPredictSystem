    <div class="field-value"><p>Symmetric DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene transcription and occurs mainly at the C5 position of CpG dinucleotides. CpGs are often clustered into CpG islands at promoters of genes. Methylation at CpG island leads to silencing of gene expression.</p>
<p>Aberrant DNA methylation patterns both hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal cells - have been associated with a carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes. Aberrations in DNA methylation seen in cancer involve both DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes and hypomethylation at CpG poor promoters.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of CpG sites within the promoters of genes can lead to their silencing, a feature found in a number of human cancers for example the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. It has been established that tumour suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutation. In contrast, the hypomethylation of CpG sites has been associated with the oncogenes activation within cancer cells.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps to maintain genomic integrity. It was demonstrated that DNA methylation in intergenic regions silences cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites, instead in repetitive elements prevents transposition by silencing of repeats ot mutation of the repeats (meC to T), by silencing of repeats also transcriptional interference from strong promoters is avoided and additionally methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic intervals are commonly finded in cancer cell lines. These hypomethylation caused a genomic instability and it is associated with illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition as well as activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes (c.f. Avy and Axinfu alleles).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the IGF2/H19 cluster there is the imprint control region (ICR), which in a normal cell is methylated on the paternal allele, and unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it's unmethylated, CTCF 4 is bound to an insulator, and the enhancers in this case acts on H19 but Igf2 is silent for the maternal allele and expression will not occur. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and the enhancers can act on IGF2, because CTCF is not binding to insulator and IGF2 is expressed from the pattern allele.</p>
<p>In cancer cell e.g. in Wilm’s tumour a methylation of ICR on the maternal allele is also observed and it leads to loss of imprinting on the maternal allele. In this case there is also expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele and there is a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell.</p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. Igf2 is growth promoting, and its overexpression is associated with a very wide array of tumor types and occurs as a very early event.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating (or hypomethylating) agents, the class of epigenetic inhibitors.</p>
<p>Methylation of DNA is a major mechanism that regulates gene expression in cells. When DNA methylation is increased, this can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth. Decitabine directly inhibits DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA.</p>
<p>Decitabine's anti-tumour effects are believed to be twofold. One way that it works is by demethylation of DNA and causes normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites.  Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent cell generations. DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. Affected genes are permanently silenced, since methylation marks are propagated through mitosis and are maintained in the malignant clone.</p>
<p>The epigenome is sensitive to changes in the environment, and this can influence gene expression and the development of a cell or an organ (the epigenetic signals can go both ways, resulting in an increase or decrease in gene expression). The sensitive periods are periods of active reprogramming when epigenetic marks at different parts in the genome are removed and laid down. The periods of a life cycle that seem to be most sensitive to changes in the environments are primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development.</p>
<p>Treating patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation during sensitive periods is inadvisable because they can disrupt development of primordial germ cell or embryo. Finally, it could result in a different phenotype or a different epigenetic outcome.</p></div>
