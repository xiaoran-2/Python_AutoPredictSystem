    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are some epigenetic abnormalities in normal function of DNA methylation.</p>
<p>In normal function of DNA methylation, (in a normal cell/tissue) the CpG islands are hipomethylated, so in general there are no methylation in CpG islands, but the genome is methilated in Rep elements, intergenic regions and in the introns of  genes.</p>
<p>In cancer cell, CpG island are more likely to be methilated, but the genome is hipomethylated in Rep elements, intergenic regions and in the introns of  genes.</p>
<p>That is, the global methylation level will decrease as it passes through the stages of hyperplasia, neoplasia and finally, invasion, being the inverse of the density of methylation in CpG islands.</p>
<p>The consequence of hypomethylation depends on location, Repeats/ Intergenic regions have more genomic instability, due to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p>
<p> Finally, the contribution of DNA methylation to cancer are hpomethylation genome-wide and tumour suppressor hypermethylation, don't forgetting that the role of DNA methylation is dependent on situation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer. The hypermethylation of ICRs can lead to loss of imprinting, causing alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), that can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation example:</p>
<p>The ICR region are normally methylated on the paternal allele, so the enhancers can act on Igf2, because CTCF is not binded and Igf2 its expressed on the patern allele.</p>
<p>The ICR region are normally unmethylated on the maternal allele, and when its unmethylated CTCT will bind to this element, and the enhancers will act on H19, but Igf2 will be silenced on the maternal allele. </p>
<p>But, with loss of imprinting, there is hipermethylation of ICR on the maternal allele too. Both alleles are expressing Igf2, so there is a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell, and Igf2 is a growth promoting, associating this with Wilm’s tumour.</p>
<p>That’s a common, early event, often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue (e.g. Hypermethylation of ICR, Igf2 overexpression in Wilm’s tumour).</p>
<p>But in ICR can be found hypermethylation or hipomethylation, that depends on context.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The nature of these reactions means epigenetic processes are susceptible to chemical intervention in a way that genetic mutations are not.</p>
<p>The epigenetic drug Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, are a DNA-demethylating agent (class: DNMTi) that are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Chemically, it is a cytidine analog.</p>
<p>It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It functions in a similar manner to azacitidine, although decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike other forms of gene regulation, epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p>The DMNTi, are all nucleoside analogues, they get incorporated into DNA upon replication and then they are irreversibly binded to DNMTs.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are the periods of development when environment has the biggest influence on the epigenetic makeup. The sensitive periods are the periods when the epigenome is actively remodeled (removal and reestablishment of epigenetic marks) and include primordial germ cell development through mature eggs/sperm and the preimplantation and postimplantation periods.   </p>
<p>Somatic maintenance period seems to be periods of least sensitivity.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because there are some sorts of things there need be considered, like in younger patients (cancer or otherwise), and the effects on germ cells.</p>
<p>Epigenetic marks may be transmitted transgenerationally, so any environmental effects may have multi-generational effects.</p></div>
