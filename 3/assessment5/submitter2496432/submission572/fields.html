    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in both global DNA methylation and mehtylation at CpG islands are associated with many types of cancers. In normal cells CpG islands are unmethylated and these dense clusters of genes located at promoters, allow gene expression in their unmethylated active state. In cancer CpG islands are targeted and become more densely methylated, resulting in deactivation. Methylation of CpG islands leads to condensed or repressive chromatin state which prohibits transcription factor binding. Increased methylation at CpG follows a progression towards a metastatic state by repression of tumor suppressor genes. The repressive epigeneitic marks are mitotically heritable and effective at knocking down tumor suppressor genes. DNA methylation leads to disease by causing gene silencing at multiple levels including formation of repressive chromatin strucuture which cuases repressive proteins MeCP to bind to DNA and by prohibiting transcription factor binding altogether. DNA methylation intergenic regions maintains genomic stability with Dnmt1j and silences cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites which prevents transcription of genes in approrpriate directions and prevents abberrant gene splicing. In cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypo-methylated leading to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and activation of cryptic pomoters. Hypomethylation of resulting from Dnmt1 in causes genomic instability while mutations in DNMT3B (repeats found around centromere) cause Immunodeficiency in Cranial Facial Structure).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal alelle Igf2 imprinting control region hypermethylation patterns lead to expression of Igf2. Igf2 imprinting control region is unmethylated on maternal allele which binds CTCF and causes enhancers to act on gene H19, ultimately silencing Igf2. In cancer of Wilm's tumor maternal allele is also hypermehtylated leading to expression of Igf2 from both maternal and paternal alleles. This results in a double dose of Igf2 and ultimately the disease phenotype shows increased growth resulting from high doses of insulin like growth factor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs known as DNMT inhibitors commonly used on myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by irreversibly binding and inhibitng DNA methyltransferase after they are incorporated into the DNA. Because this binding is replication dependent this drug has greater effect on cancers which are dividing rapidly; tumors are characterized by rapid cell division and growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have lasting effects because DNA methylation marks are mitotically heritable. Exceeding care should be taken anytime when altering DNA methylation because of the potential lasting effects, but especially during sensitive periods. This is anytime the genome is plastic and receptive to environmental stimuli. Sensitive periods, including the male pronucleus after formation of the zygote and in primordial germ cells, are when genome-wide demthylation occurs causing a reprograming effect. Targeting parents during sensitive periods is especially risky because there is potential to effect not only onself but future children and grand children through direct effects on the blastula, and the fetal primordial germ cells; this is not even considering the transgenerational inheritance that has been demonstrated in alteration of the epigenome past the grandchilder.</p></div>
