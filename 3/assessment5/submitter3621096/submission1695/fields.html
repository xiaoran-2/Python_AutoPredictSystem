    <div class="field-value"><p>The main point for how DNA methylation is altered in cancer is that the role of DNA methylation is CONTEXT dependent.  Different tumors have different dependencies – some are driven by tumor suppression hypermethylation, while others are driven by chromosomal instability.  CpG islands – clusters of CpGs – are often present in the 5’ regulatory regions of many genes and are normally unmethylated.  DNA methylation of these CpG islands tends to correlate inversely with gene expression.  The methylated Cytosine (5mC) can be converted to thymine by spontansous or enzymatic deamination, so it is thought that the loss of genomic CpGs is due to deamination of methylated sequences from the germline.  As a result, it is thought CpG islands exist because they were never (or only transiently) methylated in the germline.  In cancer, however, CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, leading to transcriptional silencing of important genes that is then inherited by daughter cells.  Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands can contribute to disease through perturbance of imprint control regions (ICRs).  Alteration of DNA methylation to these ICRs (either hypo or hypermethylation) can result in the loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes.  Both of these circumstances can lead to development of cancer or other disease.  As opposed to CpG island methylation, DNA methylation in intragenic regions is typically observed at repetitive sequences where it is present in highly expressed genes and speculated to relate to replicational timing.  In normal tissues, these intragenic and repeat regions are often methylated, but hypomethylation (such as through loss of DNMT activity) can lead to genomic instability and activation of genes that should otherwise be silent, ultimately causing cancer and other human diseases (such as ICF syndrome).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.  It belongs to the DNA Methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors class, and it functions to de-methylate DNA through inhibition of DNMT which results in DNA methylation marks not being copied over to replicated DNA strands (daughter cells).  This is a passive loss of DNA methylation through the active inhibition of the enzyme that maintains methylation marks.  Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect through reversal of the aberrant DNA methylation signal that was perpetuated in the tumor cell.  For example, hypermethylation of a CpG island in a promoter region of a tumor suppressor would lead to its transcriptional silencing and a proliferative advantage for tumor cells; removal of the silencing methylation marks would result in re-expression of this gene and reactivation of the tumor suppressing protein, ultimately leading to anti-proliferative or apoptotic effects on the tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are both reversible and heritable; passed on from parent to daughter cell, continually, until there is an alteration that disrupts machinery responsible for maintaining the mark.  DNA methylation is a relatively stable epigenetic mark and typically only removed through inactive maintenance of the mark during replication and division.  If a drug alters DNA methylation such that a mark is removed, there will no longer be a template of that mark to copy onto daughter strands of DNA.  No blueprint results in no “building” of that mark.  DNA de-methylators only work in cells that are actively dividing, but tumor cells aren’t the only dividing cells.  Care must be taken to avoid treating patients during sensitive periods of cell development.  A “sensitive” period is one in which epigenetic reprogramming and genomic imprinting occurs or in which there is rapid cell division.  Examples of this include embryonic development during pregnancy and adolescent development.  It would be inadvisable to treat a patient during one of these periods because you could permanently disrupt necessary epigenetic marks for normal cell functioning (either offspring or patient themselves), inadvertently leading to more disease development rather than curing the cancer you are trying to treat.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many genes that are imprinted are involved in growth (either suppress or promote).  As a result, it is important to have the appropriate “dose” of the gene signal and often one of the parental alleles will be silenced or activated to do so.  Disruption of the imprinting signal can alter the growth profile of a cell and lead to cancer.  An example of this is the H19/Igf2 cluster.  The imprint control region (ICR) is typically methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal.  The unmethylated ICR allows for CTCF to bind this Igf2 insulator element and enhancers then activate H19 expression instead - Igf2 will be silent.  On the paternal allele, CTCF cannot bind the methylated ICR and therefore H19 is silent because the enhancers can access and activate Igf2.  Ifg2 promotes growth, so if the maternal allele becomes hypermethylated at the ICR, resulting in expression of Igf2 instead of H19 on this allele, there will be too much of the growth promoting factor and this leads to Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>
