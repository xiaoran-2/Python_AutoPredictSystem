    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated and the respective DNA is available to the transcription machinery. In cancerous cells, CpG islands generally become hypermethylated together with neighboring regions ("shores"). One of the major consequences is silencing of the neighboring tumor suppressor genes that eventually results in tumorigenesis. Single suppressor gene examples include the RB gene in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer, BRCA1 in breast cancer, MGMT in gliomas and colorectal tumors - their silencing due to hypermethylation of CpG islands in their promoter regions has been proven to be associated with the respective tumors. Hypermethylated CpG islands or CIMP phenotype can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis, prognosis and management/treatment of the disease.<br />Unlike CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements of normal cells are hypermethylated and silenced to maintain genomic stability. They become hypomethylated in cancer. This promotes genomic instability such as illegitimate recombinations, activations of repeats, transposons, and cryptic promoters of previously silenced genes, all leading to enhancement of tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancerous cells sometimes display loss of imprinting, meaning that the genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression become no longer imprinted. Rather, they become either expressed from both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles. In the IGF2-H19 cluster, the imprint control region is normally methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. When unmethylated, CTCF transcription factor insulates this ICR and does not allow remote enhancers to promote the expression of IFG2 (instead, H19 is expressed), so in the maternal copy, IGF-2 is normally silenced. Rather, in the paternal copy, methylated ICR is not insulated by CTCF and remote enhancers promote expression of IGF2, so the paternal copy of IGF2 is normally active. In case of hypermethylation, both copies of this ICR can become methylated resulting in a double dose of IGF-2 which is growth-promoting, leading to tumorigenesis. This condition is called Wilm's tumor, a kidney tumor in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by irreversibly binding and, thus, inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). For methylation to be mitotically heritable, DNMT is required. When DNMT is absent, the daughter cells can no longer maintain double-strand methylation on their DNA, resulting in an exponential decrease in methylation rate. Since tumor cells are generally dividing much quicker, they are also expected to lose methylation much quicker than normally dividing cells in the absence of DNMT. In case of MDS, for which decitabine is currently approved, methylation is needed for cancerous cells to live because this disease is dependent on hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes. In the absence of the methylation-providing agent, cancerous cells eventually die and expectedly faster than normal cells (who also need their share of methylation). This mechanism is replication-dependent and may be applicable (still speculative) to solid organ tumors as well.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation marks are mitotically and meiotically heritable (i.e., once established or absent, the methylation mark or its absence is maintained through all subsequent cell divisions to all daugher cells, be it through mitosis or meiosis). Generally, any cell line is expected to divide a limited number of times and die, so whatever happened to it epigenetically in the first place would die too. However, there are periods in human's life when some of the current cells (stem cells, germ cells, gametes) are expected to live/divide longer than average or be passed to the next generation, namely, at gametogenesis, stem cells development in embryogenesis, germ cells development, neonatal development (also with germ/stem cells around), pre-puberty (maturation of the gametes). During these periods, any heritable disturbance of epigenome (such as increased/decreased methylation) may have long lasting and possibly trans-generational effect, so any such disturbance should be avoided until properly studied.</p></div>
