    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an inactive epigenetic mark which is mitotic heritable. Methylation in CpG islands is a process that occurs in order to silence gene expression. CpG islands are clusters of CpGs, they are most frequently found at promoters of genes and normally they tend to be protected from methylation (hypomethylated). The primary mechanism of methylation involves the formation of a repressive chromatin structure. The secondary mechanism disallows transcription factor binding and alters gene expression. <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">There are two types of DNA methylation abnormalities in cancer, the hypermethylation of CpG islands and the hypermethylation of introns and intergenic regions. Those abnormalities lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes giving the cell the advantage of dividing more rapidly or dyeing less than others so those cells will take over and result in a tumor. Tumor suppressor genes stop the uncontrolled cell growth that leads to cancer. </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The global level of methylation degreases as we progress from a normal to a metastatic tissue. At the same time, methylation at some CpG islands becomes more dense at the same progression which more specifically is normal tissue, hyperplastic tissue, neoplasia, invasive tissue. </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. The function of methylation in these regions is to maintain genomic integrity and protect the genome from transposable elements. This is achieved by the silencing or mutation of repeats to prevent transposition and transcriptional interference from strong promoters. Methylation of these repeats can also prevent illegitimate recombination. </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">As mentioned above, in cancer, there is a hypomethylation at intergenic repeats, and genomic instability resulting from deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions and even duplications or loss of chromosomes. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug in the class of DNA-demethylating agents. It is sold as Dacogen by a Japanese company named Eisai, and it is used to treat the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia called myelodysplastic syndromes. The action of Decitabine is to decrease DNA methylation and restore the normal function of tumor suppressor genes via the inhibition of DNA methyltransefrase. The drug’s anti-tumor effect can be seen through the regulation of cell division and the blockage of cancer that this agent offers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is located on chromosome 11 and it is controlled by enhancer blocking. The ICR (imprinted control region) is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele which means that it is paternally imprinted. There is a long non-coding RNA produced only from the maternal allene and it is called H19. When the ICR is umethylated on the maternal allele it is bound by CTCF which is an insulator protein and its role is to insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers. The enhancers preferably loop to the Igf2 region, but since the CTCF protein is bound to the ICR region, the enhancers loop to the H19 and act for its expression. On the paternal allele, since the ICR is methylated, CTCF cannot bind. This way, the enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and promote Igf2 expression. H19 is not active on the paternal allele due to the DNA methylation spreading downstream from ICR to the H19 promoter and it gets silenced. Igf2 is an oncogene so overdose of Igf2 caused by loss of imprinting can lead to predisposition to embryonic or childhood tumors, such as Wilm’s tumor found in the kidney. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A sensitive period of development regarding the epigenetic reprogramming is the period of time when the growth and development are rapid. This important process involves the reset of DNA methylation which is needed to restore the totipotency of the cells.  It happens during early development of the embryo and during germ cell development. These are also the periods when IVF and ICFI take place including germ cell harvest, in vitro culture and embryo handling. The fact that those processes occur during the same period as the DNA methylation reprogramming, they may lead to imprinting disorders on the patient. Also, the effect of treating patients during sensitive periods will not only have an impact on the patient alone, but on his offspring as well. This is due to the fact that DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so every change in it will be passed on to the offsprings, beyond the period of any drug treatment on the patient. </p></div>
