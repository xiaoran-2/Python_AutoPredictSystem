    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands in promoters are normally kept free of methylation. Therefore the underlying tumor suppressor gene is expressive. However, in cancer cells the promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which causes silencing of the underlying tumor suppresor gene. The tumor suppressor genes are then inactivated epigenetically and kept locked since the epigenic DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, which leads to the uncontrolled cell growth and causes the desease. In contrast, at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA is highly methylated in normal cells. Gene body methylation found in highly expessed genes has been considered to repress the transcriptional noise. As the cells become more metastatic and invasive in cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements get more hypomethylated, which cause genomic instability and disease.      </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Decitabine is a nucleotide and they get incorporated into the DNA under replication. So it is division dependent. DNA methyltransferase1 comes along and binds the Decitabine nucleotide irreversibly and then it is inactivated. The copying of  less methylated DNA to the daughter strand is thus increased. Since overmethylation of CpG islands in cancer cells silences the genes including tumor suppressor genes, Decitabine have anti-tumor effect.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region(ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele. The enhansers act on Igf2,growth promoting gene and Igf2 is expressed since CTCF is not binding to insulate ICR and it is methylated. On the other hand, ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele. The enhansers in this case will act on H19, growth restricting gene. Igf2 will be silent and we don't see the expression from maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor there is loss of imprinting. We have hypermethylation of the imprint controle region on the maternal as well as paternal allele. Hence, we have double dose of the growth promoting expression of Igf2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenic changes like altered DNA methylation will be passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells untill they are actively erased. A sensitive period is the periods when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control. It is the periods of germ cell development and early embryonic development. Blastocysts and germ cells have paternal and maternal genomes demethylated and  active reprogramming of epigenetic marks is going on at different parts in the genome. During of this periods patients are very sensitive to epigenetic agents which might alter epigenic reprogramming.     </p></div>
