    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often found at promoters of genes and are normally unmethylated, independent of their activity state. If CpG islands are methylated (which is usually not the case) gene expression is silenced by the formation of a repressive chromatin structure. The formation of a repressive chromatin structure is accomplished by the binding of CpG binding proteins to methylated CpGs of the GpG island. CpG binding proteins have a DNA binding domain (which allows them to bind to methylated CpGs) and a transcriptional repressive domain. The transcriptional repressive domain prevents gene transcription and expression. The CpG binding proteins also can recruit other factors that condense the chromatin.</p>
<p>In cancer CpG islands become hypermethylated. This causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes, resulting in uncontrollable cell growth and cancer. Tumor suppressor genes are genes that normally control cell growth. If they are silenced, this can result in cancer. Hypermethylation of CpG islands progresses with time. The longer someone has cancer, the more hypermethylated his/her CpG islands become.</p>
<p>Normally intergenic regions and repeats are methylated, to prevent genomic instability and maintain genomic integrity.  Genomic integrity can be compromised by hypomethylated intergenic regions and repeats. Hypomethylated intergenic regions are associated with deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations, and silenced cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites become activated when intergenic regions are hypomethylated. Repeats are methylated to prevent transposition, to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and to prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer intergenic regions and repeats are hypomethylated. This causes genomic instability, because of activation of repeats and transposition, illegitimate recombination and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes. Genomic instability causes mutations that can contribute to the development of cancer. Mutations can turn off tumor suppressor genes or turn on oncogenes, which can cause uncontrollable cell growth and cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region (ICR) on the paternal allele is methylated. This methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, which is silenced. The enhancers can access Igf2 and activate it. Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p>The ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated. CTCF (an insulator protein) binds to the unmethylated ICR, and insulates Igf2 from the enhancers. Igf2 cannot be reached by the enhancers and is not expressed. H19 is unmethylated, and expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor there is hypermethylation. Not only the ICR of the paternal allele is methylated, but also the ICR of the maternal allele (loss of imprinting). The maternal allele now looks like a paternal allele: the ICR and H19 of the maternal allele are methylated. Because of the methylation of the ICR, CTCF can no longer bind, and Igf2 can be reached by the enhancers.  Igf2 is now transcribed from the paternal and the maternal allele. Igf2 is growth promoting. The double dose of Igf2 can cause Wilm’s tumor.</p>
<p>Normally at imprinted genes, the paternal or the maternal allele is methylated, and the other is unmethylated. Only one of the two alleles is expressed in imprinted genes.  If this imprinting is lost and growth promoting genes are overexpressed this can result in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMTi: a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are enzymes that transfer a methylgroup to DNA. DNMT inhibitors (and thus Decitabine) are analog to nucleosides; they bind irreversibly to DNMTs after they are incorporated in DNA. Decitabine can cause hypomethylation. DNMT inhibitors are replication dependent.</p>
<p>DNMT inhibitors and Decitabine demethylate all DNA, they are not specific for cancer tissue.</p>
<p>If a tumor suppressor gene is silenced by hypermethylation, than Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect by demethylating the DNA, and thus demethylation of the tumor suppressor gene. If demethylated, the tumor suppressive gene can become active again, and suppress tumorgenisis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. It is a stable epigenetic mark, laid down by de novo methyltransferases and maintained by DNMT1. If cells with methylated DNA are replicated, the result is hemi-methylated DNA: this is DNA with one methylated DNA strand, and one unmethylated DNA strand. DNMT1 recognizes the hemi-methylated DNA, and methylates the unmethylated strand. In this way DNA methylation is maintained.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period in which the epigenome is extra vulnerable. Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming: primordial germ cell development and early development.</p>
<p>If you treat patients with medication that changes the epigenetic marks during these sensitive periods, this can cause epigenetic abnormalities. This sort of medication isn’t specific for cancer tissue. It isn’t known what kind of effects this sort of medication has on the longer term. During primordial germ cell development and early development, epigenetic marks are erased, and laid down again. If you treat patients during this period with medication that inhibits methylation (or causes demethylation) the epigenetic marks will be altered. It can lead to loss of imprinting, and cause cancer or other diseases.</p></div>
