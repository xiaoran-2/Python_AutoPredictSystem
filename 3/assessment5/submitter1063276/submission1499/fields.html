    <div class="field-value"><p title="Epigenetic therapy (page does not exist)">DNA methylation occurs at the cytosine bases of eukaryotic DNA, which are converted to 5-methylcytosine by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes. The altered cytosine residues are usually immediately adjacent to a guanine nucleotide, resulting in two methylated cytosine residues sitting diagonally to each other on opposing DNA strands.In mammals, methylation is distributed in  CpG sequences throughout thengenome, with  exception of CpG islands,where high CpG contents are found. In normal cells, CpG Islands preceding  gene promoters aregenerally unmethylated, while other individual CpG  dinucleotides throughout the genome tend to be methylated. The methylation of these sequences can lead to inappropriate gene silencing, such as the silencing of tumour suppressor genes in cancer cells. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns - hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue  have been associated with a large number of human malignancies. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. Hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms. In many disease processes, such as cancer. gene promoter CPG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results intranscriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as an important component of cancer development. Hypomethylation is linked to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting, whereas hypermethylation is associated with promoters and can arise secondary to oncogene suppressor silencing, but might be a target for epigenetic theraphy.The repetitive portion and intrinsic region of the genome is heavily methylated whereas most CpG islands remain unmethylated in normal cells, and  that cancer cells exhibit widespread loss of intergenic DNA methylation with gain of methylation at many gene-associated CpG islands. Some CpG islands located within the 3′ ends of genes and in intergenic regions exhibit hypermethylation in cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting control regions (ICRs) provide that gametic marks will be interpreted in  somatic cells to establish parent of origin-dependent expression domains. Not only the methylated state, but also the unmethylated state constitutes an imprint. <em>Example: H19 ICR, which represses the maternal IGF2 allele when unmethylated and the paternal H19 when methylated</em>. The repression of the maternal <em>IGF2 </em>allele involves the chromatin insulator factor CTCF, which interacts with only the unmethylated <em>H19 </em>ICR to block communication between the upstream promoters and downstream enhancer elements. The  methylated <em>H19 </em>ICR does not  interact with  CTCF and has no insulator function, leading to an active paternal <em>IGF2 </em>allele. The methylation state constitutes, a binary switch that partitions the <em>IGF2 </em>into an active or inactive expression domain depending on the sex of the transmitting parent. Wilms tumors with LOI show aberrant methylation of the maternal <em>H19 </em>ICR, involving CTCF binding sites, which abrogates CTCF binding and allows <em>IGF2 </em>activation. Also Wilms tumors were found to have biallelic expression of <em>IGF2 </em>,a gene that encodes for a growth factor known to be oncogenic when overexpressed .Inactivation of the reciprocally imprinted <em>H19 </em>gene at <em>IGF2 </em>locus in Wilms’ tumor could result from loss of <em>H19 </em>expression.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>

    <div class="field-value"><p title="Acute myeloid leukemia"><strong>Decitabine</strong><strong> or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</strong>, is a drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes  and for    acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Chemically, it is a <strong>cytidine</strong> (<em>Nucloeoside) Analog</em><strong> </strong>.Decitabine is hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA <strong>by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases</strong>. Decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands. These compounds function as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and have shown substantial potency in reactivating epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes in vitro.The rationale behind demethylation therapies is the ability of DNA methyl transferase inhibitors to revert hypermethylation induced gene silencing.Hypermethylation induced gene silencing of tumor suppressor genes and other cancer related genes plays a fundamental role in tumorigenesis.The reversion of these epigenetic mutations can therefore restore proliferation control and apoptosis sensitivity. Most studies have focused on the p15 tumor suppressor gene, which can be hypermethylated in MDS and AML patients and can be demethylated and reactivated in patients undergoing decitabine therapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The mechanisms that alter the function of genes without altering the underlying DNA sequence known as epigenetic mechanisms. The treatment with cytotoxic agents, 5-azacytidine  and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine leads to  inhibition of <strong>DNA methylation</strong>.These nucleoside analogs get incorporated into the DNA of rapidly growing tumor cells during replication and inhibit DNA methylation by trapping DNA methyltransferases onto the DNA, leading to their depletion inside the cell .This drug-induced reduction of DNA methylation causes growth inhibition in cancer cells by activating tumor suppressor genes aberrantly silenced in cancer . Epigenetic therapy changes the behavior of cancer cells by blocking chemical changes to DNA, through a process called methylation hat turns genes on or off. The concept behind epigenetic treatment is to “reprogram” the network of chemical changes that affect the DNA of cancer cells. This reprogramming can alter the activity of critical genes in cancer cells that drive their growth and survival.  <strong>Sensitive period </strong>is<strong> </strong>  period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable. Because of the change in the contribution of epigenetic mechanisms to genomic function, particularly in the development of complex behavioral phenotypes.</p>
