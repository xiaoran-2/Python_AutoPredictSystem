    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer methylation status of many DNA regions is altered. Epigenetic defects may cause a disrupting effect on genes activity similar to that of a mutation. There are several kinds of changes in DNA methylation associated with cancer.</p>
<p>CpG islands are regions with high CpG density located in promoters of most genes. Normally CpG islands remain unmethylated independently of the corresponding gene activity. In cancer cells they are often <strong>hypermethylated</strong> which causes the silencing of the corresponding genes (it can be, for example, a tumour supressor gene). Along with CpG islands there can be alterations in CpG shores. CpG shores are regions at short distances from CpG islands and their methylation correlates with gene expression and is present in different tumours.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal DNA are usually silenced by methylation which contributes to DNA stability and integrity. In cancer cells they are often <strong>hypomethylated</strong> which leads to activation of this regions and disrupting of normal DNA transcription.</p>
<p>Another possible epigenetic cancer mark is <strong>hypomethylation</strong> of CpG-poor promoters which leads to activation of the corresponding genes (it can be an oncogene, i.e. inducing cell proliferation or disrupting apoptosis).</p>
<p>Different alterations in DNA methylation are found in different tumours and thus can be used for classifying tumours and making prognosis about the disease.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Loss of epigenetic marks in differentially methylated regions may result in overexpression of growth promoting genes (usually paternally imprinted in mammals) and silencing of growth restricting genes (usually maternally imprinted in mammals) which leads to uncontrolled growth of cancer cells.</p>
<p>An example of disruption of imprinting in cancer is hypermethylation of ICR at <em>H19/lgf2</em> cluster. If this ICR is unmethylated the <em>H19</em> non-coding RNA is expressed and creates a block between the downstream enhancers and the upstream <em>lgf2</em> gene promoter (if this ICR is methylated <em>H19</em> is silenced, the enhancers are uninsulated and <em>lgf2</em> is expressed). Normally this imprinting control region is methylated in paternal allele and unmethylated in maternal allele. So <em>lgf2</em> is paternally expressed.</p>
<p><em>LGF-2</em> (insulin-like growth factor 2) is a growth promoting hormone. In Wilm's tumour the imprinting mark is lost (i.e. ICR is methylated both in paternal and maternal alleles) and <em>lgf2</em> is overexpressed.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>'Decitabine' is a DNA-demethylating agent, it inhibits DNA methyltransferase. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes when, as found, different genes involved in apoptosis or cell growth regulation are silenced because of hypermethylation at the promoter region (http://tiny.cc/i1t31w;  http://tiny.cc/82t31w;  http://tiny.cc/73t31w;  http://tiny.cc/i5t31w;  http://tiny.cc/z6t31w).</p>
<p>Demethylating these DNA regions 'Decitabine' may promote activation of growth regulatory and tumour supressor genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic state is mitotically heritable, so the changes caused by a drug may pass to next generations cells until malignance epigenetic marks extinguish.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods (in epigenetics) are periods when cell reprogramming occurs and epigenetic status is not maintained. There are two sensitive periods when clearing and renewal of epigenetic marks occurs: early development (pre-implantation period) and primordial germ cells development (forming of germ cells in mid-gestation embryo).</p>
<p>That's why epigenetic drugs should be avoided during pregnancy (for women) or if conception is planned (both for males and females) in order to prevent disruption of embryo development.</p>
