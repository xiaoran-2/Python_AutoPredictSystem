    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are present in the 5' regulatory regions of many genes. DNA methylation affect the transcription of genes by physically impeding the binding of transcriptional proteins to the gene or methylated DNA being bound by proteins known as methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs). Global hypomethylation is implicated in the development &amp; progression of cancer through different mechanisms while hypermethylation mostly occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region, associating with gene inactivation. In cancer cells, CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters are hypermethylated, while CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions is decreased. In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation serves as a mark of transcriptional downregulation, helps prevent the deleterious consequences by preventing transcription from happening in places it has no business happening. In cancer, global genomic hypomethylation affects repetitive sequences, oncogenes, and genes associated with invasion and metastases.And it leads to genomic instability and oncogene activation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br />Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process that involves DNA methylation and histone modulation to achieve monoallelic gene expression. Igf2 (The Insulin-like growth factor 2) encodes a fetal growth-factor while H19 encodes a transcript which may downregulate cellular proliferation. Igf2 is predominantly expressed from the paternal allele. There is methylation of CpG-rich regions on the repressed allele (maternal allele). Overexpression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), on chromosome 11p15, causes Wilms tumor (WT). Loss of imprinting (LOI) in a differential methylated region (DMR) of the IGF2/H19 cluster is responsible for this. Compared to normal renal tissue, transcriptional activity of the imprinted gene IGF2 is increased &amp; massive overexpression of all genes, except for H19, in WT.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating (hypomethylating) agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Chemically, it is a cytidine analog &amp; can be incorporated into DNA strands. It is thought to induce antineoplastic activity by two mechanisms; (i) inhibition of DNA methyltransferase causing hypomethylation of DNA, and (ii) direct cytotoxicity in abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA, leading to a covalent binding with DNA methyltransferases and preventing DNA synthesis, resulting cytotoxicity &amp; cell death.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Most epigenetic modification is believed to be erased with each new generation, during gameto-genesis and after fertilization. However, epigenetic changes may endure in subsequent generations of organisms. Altered DNA methylation patterns cause abnormal expression of cancer-related genes; DNA hypomethylation activates oncogenes &amp; initiates chromosome instability, whereas DNA hypermethylation initiates silencing of tumor suppressor genes. A sensitive period means the time during the first few years of life, from birth (or before) to the time of essentially complete development of the brain, about age 6 or 7. Alternatively, it means several overlapping periods during which the child is particularly sensitive to certain types of stimuli or interactions. Sensitive periods of development are- from birth to 6 years, 1.5 to 3 years, 1.5 to 4 years, 2 to 4 years, 2.5 to 6 years, 3 to 6 years, 4 to 5 years, 4.5 to 6 years. It is generally believed that early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. Treating patients during sensitive periods can have lasting effects &amp; thus may contribute to epigenetic mechanisms of genomic function, particularly in the development of complex phenotypes. So, treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable.     <br /><br /></p></div>
