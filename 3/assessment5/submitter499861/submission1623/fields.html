    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the main epigenetic changes observed in cancer.  A normal cell often has no or sparse methylation at CpG island promoter regions.  The addition of CH3 at C-G pairs leads to binding by MeCP1/MeCP2 proteins whose transcriptional repression domains act to silence the DNA regions that are bound.  Other factors are also recruited by the binding proteins to condense chromatin in these regions which further silences the DNA by decreasing its accessibility.  Thus the lack of CpG island methylation, which is characteristic of a normal cell, allows gene expression to proceed.</p>
<p>In cancer there is hypermethylation at CpG islands especially at tumor suppressor gene areas.  A celebrity example of this is BRCA1 which encodes a protein that repairs damaged DNA.  In breast tumors BRCA1 can be mutated or methylated leading to loss of function and thereby loss of cell protection from DNA damage.  Since methylation is mitotically heritable, when it acts to prohibit the normal functioning of tumor suppressors, it will be selected for as the cells that are altered in this way will have a competitive growth advantage and this can be one of the hits that leads to cancer.</p>
<p>A normal cell typically maintains methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions in order to maintain genomic stability.  Silencing via methylation prevents the errors that can occur from cryptic start or splice sites and insertion of repetitive elements into other genes.  In cancer the opposite has been observed, with hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions.  In mouse DNMT1 knockouts this hypomethylation leads to increased deletions, insertions and translocations in the affected tissue.  Since some of the mutations will activate oncogenes or tumor suppressors or help the cell evade apoptosis they will be selected for and the cell proliferation will ultimately result in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster on chromosome 11 is an imprinted region and disruption here can lead to cell overgrowth.  The two alleles are typically differentially methylated.  The maternal ICR is unmethylated and can be bound by CTCF insulator protein which blocks the downstream enhancers from the upstream Igf2 gene.  The enhancers will then bind the downstream H19 instead, producing a long non-coding RNA that regulates Igf2 expression.  The paternal ICR is methylated so CTCF can no longer bind and the enhancers now bind the unblocked Igf2 in cis.  H19 will remain inactive due to methylation spreading downstream from the paternal ICR.  In the case of Wilms tumor there is loss of imprinting of Igf2, a growth-promoting oncogene, in over half of cases.  This occurs by paternal disomy of chromosome 11 resulting in two active Igf2 loci, or a mutated maternal allele or much less frequently disrupted methylation.  Any of these situations result in aberrant activation of the normally repressed maternal Igf2 allele and reduced expression of H19. In the case of Wilms tumor the Igf2 overexpression occurs early in progenitor cells of the nephrons and the uncontrolled cell growth ultimately leads to kidney tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine acts as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  It is a nucleoside analog that is incorporated into DNA and irreversibly binds DNMT via a serine residue at the active site of DNA methyltransferases thus reducing DNA methylation with each cell replication.  In acute myeloid leukemia genome wide methylation profiling, there was globally reduced DNA methylation after treatment with decitabine, especially at CpG islands or CpG island shores (Yan et al, Blood 2012, vol 120 no 12 p 2466-2474). It is also used in myelodysplastic syndrome, a hematologic disorder which may be dependent on CpG island hypermethylation at tumor suppressor genes.  By reducing DNMT activity and thus demethylating these hypermethylated CpG islands, decitabine acts to inhibit cancer growth by reactivating epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation such as DNMT inhibitors can have lasting effects on the epigenome of a cell by affecting the methylation status during cell replication.  Methylated cytosines on the parent strand will be recognized by DNMT1 leading to symmetric methylation of daughter strands.  However if the methylation mark is removed, there is no recognition of it during methylation and the daugther strands will also remain unmethylated.  This is useful in malignancies, for instance to remove aberrant hypermethylation at CpG islands, but could potentially have untoward effects if demethylation ocurred during sensitive periods.  These sensitive periods include times when epigenetic reprogramming is taking place: during pre-implantation, early post-implantation, primordial germ cell development in the embryo all the way through the production of mature gametes and during tissue differentiation.  If DNMT inhibitor was used during one of these periods, the epigenome could be incorrectly replicated as the methyl marks removed could no longer be passed on in further cell cycles. This would likely disrupt imprinted genes by removing differential methyl marks, potentially affect X inactivation and could lead to abnormal cell differentiation as genes that are supposed to be silenced are reactivated by demethylation.</p></div>
