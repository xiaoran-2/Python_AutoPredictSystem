    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands normally acts as a repressive epigenetic mark, resulting in the silencing of the gene(s) which the CpG islands are associated with, especially if the CpG islands are found in the promotor of a gene. It can be noted that, normally, CpG islands often remain <em>un</em>methylated. In cancer however, the methylation of specific GpG islands (CGIs) increases abnormally. Such locus-specific hypermethylation contributes to disease, as genes such as tumour suppressor genes may be epigenetically silenced as a result, increasing the likelihood of tumerogenesis occurring, as cells may now have fewer restrictions on cell growth/division. According to the Knudson hypothesis, if there are multiple 'hits' (e.g. multiple tumour suppressor genes are silenced by widespread hypermethylation of CGIs, which is not uncommon) then the probability of tumerogenesis (and consequently disease such as cancer) occurring increases further. </p>
<p>Intergenic regions of the genome and repetitive elements are usually methylated, in order to maintain genomic integrity and stability - such methylation helps prevent deletions/insertions/reciprocal translocations of the DNA sequence, as well as silencing repeats to prevent transposition. In cancer, global DNA methylation of such intergenic regions / repetitive elements decreases. This global hypomethylation results in a loss of genomic stability, as there are more deletions/insertions/reciprocal translocations throughout the genome. Illegitimate recombination between repeats can also occur, as they are no longer densely packed as heterochromatin and so can be more easily accessed by transcription factors, and allowed to recombine. As many tumour types are driven by chromosomal instability (for example), such genomic instability due to reduced intergenic DNA methylation can enhance tumerogenesis, contributing to disease.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is imprinted - the imprint control region (ICR) of the paternal allele for this cluster is methylated. As a result of this ICR methylation, the insulator protein CTCF cannot bind to the ICR, meaning that Igf2 is not insulated and so the downstream enhancers of this cluster can act on Igf2 (via chromatin looping), allowing Igf2 to be expressed. </p>
<p>The ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated, meaning CTCF can bind to it. As a result, Igf2 is insulated by this protein, and the downstream enhancers cannot act to express it (an alternative chromatin loop is established, and H19 is expressed instead). </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour there is a loss of imprinting, i.e. the ICRs of both alleles are unmethylated and are not imprinted. Such disrupted imprinting contributes to disease as Igf2 is a growth-promoting oncogene, and will be overexpressed. It also means there is underexpression of Cdkn1c (a growth supressor) so overall there is sustained proliferative signalling and uncontrolled cell growth, which contributes to disease such as cancer. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, and so belongs to the epigenetic class of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors. Decitabine therefore reduces DNA methylation, by inhibiting the enzymes (DNMTs) that lay down DNA methylation. It can have an anti-tumour effect as, by reducing the DNA methylation levels of specific CpG islands associated with tumour suppressor genes, the expression of such tumour suppressor genes may increase. As a result, there will be reduced proliferative signalling and greater growth inhibition, meaning tumour growth may be reduced / stopped - thus, Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome as it is mitotically heritable - as cells divide to produce the next generations, the methylation marks are maintained by DNMTs which lay down the correct methylation pattern on the new strand of unmethylated DNA. Thus, these methylation marks will remain unless they are actively erased. </p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period where epigenetic marks (e.g. DNA methylation / histone marks) are cleared from the epigenome and reset. The pre-implantation phase of development is a sensitive period, as is the period during which the primordial germ cells (PGCs) are being reprogrammed. </p>
<p>It would be inadvisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods (e.g. when the PGSs are repreogrammed), as the drugs may interfere with the clearing / resetting of epigenetic marks by inhibiting certain epigenetic machinery (e.g. DNMTs / HDACs) and their exact mechanisms are often unknown. If the incorrect epigenetic marks are established, and as (in the case of DNA methylation) they have a mitotically heritable effect, it may result in long-term susceptibility to cancer / other epigenetic diseases as undesirable genes or regions of the genome may be activated, or important genes may be silenced. </p></div>
