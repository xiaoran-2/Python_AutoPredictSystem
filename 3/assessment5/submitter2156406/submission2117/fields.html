    <h1>Submission 2117 from Anon (session_user_id: fc9807db8716d79214a34c2af3d851b0a761e436)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the CpG islands are un-methylated, while the repetitive elements, intergenic regions, and genes are methylated.</p>
<p>In cancer the exact reverse to the above statement is true.  The CpG islands are methylated(hypermethylation) while the others are not.</p>
<p>CpG islands involved in multiple tumor suppresor genes(Knudson) are the ones that are effected in cancer.</p>
<p>Normally the the DNA methylation is locked down by mitotically heritable epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>In cancer the previously methylated imprint control regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated and genes like IGF2(growth) are expressed to a higher degree.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>From the lectures the methylation of the paternal allele is unmethylated for IGF2.  The maternal is methylated.  In cancer(Wilm's) the maternal allele becomes expressed for IGF2 by the methylation of H19.  Because of this IGF2 is overly expressed and growth of the cancer cell is increased.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent,  It is used to treat myleodysplastic syndromes that are a precurser to AML.  Decitabine acts to un-methylate areas thus slowing down tumor growth and making the cancer more seseptible to chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because epigenetic marks are mitotically heretible the effect of these epigenetic agents(drugs) is lasting in the cell line.</p>
<p>A sensitive period would be in childhood.  Effects on the germ cell lines need to be concidered when altering epigenetics at this time.  </p>
<p>Because these drugs are broad spectrum(i.e. they globally effect methylation in some cases) children with developing germ cells could be adversly effected.</p>
<p>Germ cells pass traits down to they patients offspring.  Altering genetic epression in this way could cause a heretible abnormality.</p></div>
