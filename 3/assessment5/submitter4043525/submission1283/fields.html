    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The global level of methylation decreaes from a normal tissue to a mestestatic tissue. But methylation at some CpG islands becomes more dense. You start off with a normal tissue and then you progress to hyperplasia followed by neoplasia and invansion. Activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressors lead to cancer. Cancer cells at CpG islands are more methylated than a normal cell and the rest of the genome is hypermethylated. DNA methylation in mitotically heritable and epimutation is rapidly selected. Cancer is the result of multiple hits to DNA. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promotes genes. The paternal allele is methylated and the enhancers act on igf2. Igf2 is expressed. The maternal allele is unmethylated and the enhancers act on H19. Igf2 will be silent. The H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm's tumor because the maternal allele is now  methylated which means there is an expression of igf2 and results in growth promoting. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylating agents. Used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which are the precursores of acute myelogenous leukemia. It was the first time epigentic that an epigenetic drug was deployed successfully againt a solid tumor. Even if the drug didn't really srink the tumor, the next time the person did chemotherapy they had a very good reaction. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A sensitive period brings us closer to complex behavior phenotypes. Patients should be treated during sensitive periods because it would influence DNA methylation patters on several genes. It would also represent stable epigenetic modifications that alter gene transcription throughout the lifespan and promote behavioral outcomes </p></div>
