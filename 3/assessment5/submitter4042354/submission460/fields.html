    <div class="field-value"><p>The primary function of DNA methylation is to protect the genome of transposable elements.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is found in some regions, but rarely occurs at CPG Islands, because CpG Islands in general are not methylated.</p>
<p>DNA methylation serves to maintain genetic integrity or maintaining the genetic stability, being necessary for the proper development and embryogenesis.</p>
<p>In some special cases in which the CPG Islands are hypermethylated, cytosines when it should not be, silencing occurs the surrounding genes, including so-called tumor suppressor genes, whose function is to prevent the uncontrolled growth of cells that cause cancer. Cells that do not contain DNA methyltransferase-1 does not have the maintenance of methylation, then the cells exhibit genomic instability.</p>
<p>But there are other parts of the gene are DNA based, as in the intergenic ranges or repetitive elements, that has as function the methylation of repetitive elements to prevent illegitimate recombination, because DNA methylation is mutagenic, which, in this case, also seem to make some expression silencing.</p>
<p>In cancer, does not have the same type of DNA methylation in a normal cell, global changes in DNA methylation. What happens in the case of cancer is that these intergenic intervals and their repetitive elements tend to be methylated, not means that, throughout the genome, which tend to see role.</p>
<p>Cancer tends to see the genomic instability, which tend to see these deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations illegitimate. And even duplication of chromosomes or chromosome loss.</p>
<p>Role in intergênicos ranges and then repetitive elements can actually take or help bring genomic instability in cancer cases, as well as the Islands based CpGs of silencing tumor suppressor genes promoters.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>

    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Is an inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferase in the form of azacitidina, decitabine and used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a role. hypomethylation DNA, inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p>Functioning similarly to azacitidine, although decitabine may not be incorporated into the DNA chains, while the azacitidine can be incorporated into both the strings of DNA and RNA. Are all nucleoside analogs.</p>
<p>After conversion is incorporated into the DNA instead of cytosine in duplication, inactivating DNMTs and inhibiting the methylation.</p>
<p>The decitabine can increase the activity of genes that have been silenced in cancer cells. It works by reducing a portion of DNA methyl group affected. Thinking that the excess of methylation (methyl group acts on the cytosine, making the inactive gene) found in cancer cells turns off genes that normally suppress tumor development Act.</p>
<p>The action of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is dependent on cell division, so that cancer cells <span>split</span> more rapidly than most other cells in the body will be more severely affected.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
