    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group at position 5 of the cytosine pyrimidine ring or the number 6 of the purine ring nitrogen adenine (adenine and cytosine are two of the four bases of DNA).</p>
<p>This modification may be inherited through cell division. DNA methylation is normally removed during zygote formation and re-established through successive cell divisions during development, although recent studies show that the hydroxylation of the methyl group occurs instead of complete removal of the methyl groups in the zygote.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is a crucial part of normal development of organisms and cell differentiation in higher organisms. DNA methylation alters stable pattern of gene expression in the cells so that the cells can "remember where they have been" or decrease the expression of genes, for example, cells to be programmed pancreatic islets during embryonic development remain pancreatic islets throughout the life of the organism, without continuous signals tell them to stay islets.</p>
<p>Furthermore, DNA methylation suppresses the expression of viral genes and other harmful elements that have been incorporated into the host genome in time.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is also the base of the chromatin structure, which allows cells to form the necessary features for the myriad of multicellular life immutable one DNA sequence.</p>
<p>DNA methylation also plays a crucial role in the development of most cancers.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the DNA - for example the number 5 carbon of the cytosine pyrimidine ring - in this case the specific effect of reducing gene expression. DNA methylation at the 5 position of cytosine is found in all vertebrates examined. Adult somatic tissues, DNA methylation usually occurs in a context CpG dinucleotide, CpG methylation is not common in embryonic stem cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>H19</em> is located within a cluster of imprinted genes on the human chromosome 11 in p15.5 (homologue to the murine distal chromosome 7). The regulation of <em>H19</em>and its closely linked and reciprocally imprinted neighbor, <em>IGF2</em>, has been studied intensively both because of its role in human diseases and as a model for understanding imprinting control mechanisms. Thereby, <em>H19</em> is transcribed only from the maternal allele, whereas <em>IGF2</em> expression is exclusively paternal (<a class="xref-bibr" href="http://mcb.asm.org/content/28/22/6731.full#ref-8">8</a>). Over the years, <em>H19</em> is considered as a regulatory RNA (<a class="xref-bibr" href="http://mcb.asm.org/content/28/22/6731.full#ref-5">5</a>). It has been proposed to function in many different processes, ranging from transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation (<a class="xref-bibr" href="http://mcb.asm.org/content/28/22/6731.full#ref-25">25</a>, <a class="xref-bibr" href="http://mcb.asm.org/content/28/22/6731.full#ref-26">26</a>, <a class="xref-bibr" href="http://mcb.asm.org/content/28/22/6731.full#ref-53">53</a>) to tumor suppression (<a class="xref-bibr" href="http://mcb.asm.org/content/28/22/6731.full#ref-35">35</a>, <a class="xref-bibr" href="http://mcb.asm.org/content/28/22/6731.full#ref-45">45</a>) and oncogenesis, more particularly in breast cancer (<a class="xref-bibr" href="http://mcb.asm.org/content/28/22/6731.full#ref-1">1</a>, <a class="xref-bibr" href="http://mcb.asm.org/content/28/22/6731.full#ref-27">27</a>, <a class="xref-bibr" href="http://mcb.asm.org/content/28/22/6731.full#ref-28">28</a>).</p>
<p>Genomic imprinting plays a critical role in modulating gene expression during embryogenesis and normal development (<a class="xref-bibr" href="http://mcb.asm.org/content/28/22/6731.full#ref-36">36</a>). It consists of an epigenetic modification that results in the silencing of a specific allele, depending on its parental origin. Most of the 80 mammalian imprinted genes identified thus far are organized into clusters (<a class="xref-bibr" href="http://mcb.asm.org/content/28/22/6731.full#ref-33">33</a>). It has been suggested that the clustering of genes enables sharing of <em>cis</em>-acting elements located several kilobase pairs away </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>called EZH2. This enzyme attaches methyl groups to histone proteins, which are part of the chromosomal packaging. A lot of lymphomas—cancers of the immune system—are caused by mutations that make EZH2 overactive. Such overactivity methylates histones more than they should be and thus silences the genes they surround, including so-called tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.</p>
<p> newly developed inhibitor, currently referred to by the unmemorable name GSK2816126, they found that the amount of histone overmethylation declined dramatically. And when they treated both cell cultures and laboratory animals with GSK2816126, they found it also reduces the proliferation of tumour cells while, crucially, having no apparent effect on nearby normal cells.</p>
<p>That, indeed, appears to be what is happening in the case of GSK2816126. If it is, it would truly be a conceptual breakthrough, and epigenetics might justly take its place alongside genetics in the analysis and treatment of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Stephen Baylin at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, in Baltimore, have shown that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. This result was notable for two reasons. It was the first time epigenetic drugs had been deployed successfully against a solid tumour, rather than a leukaemia or a lymphoma (solid tumours are harder to treat, because the drug has to penetrate them). And, second, some of the participants in Dr Baylin's study who did not show much response to the trial itself then went on to show an unexpectedly good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them next. Although it is too early to say for sure, Dr Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</span></p></div>
