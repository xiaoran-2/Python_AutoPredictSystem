    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation of the CpG islands regions is associated with a repressive form of the chromatin structure whereby the <sup>me</sup>CpG evades the binding of the transcription factor protein and modifies the gene expression as well as condenses the chromatin structure. The gene expression is related to the GpG island regions because it contains the promoter area of the gene which can regulate the transcription, so a GpG region free of methylations allows the gene expression. However, the methylation pattern is altered in cancer where the cell presents a hypermethylated CpG islands. That alteration silences the normal expression of the gene which could be really important in signal pathways such as apoptosis, cell division as well as cell differentiating or DNA repairing. The final result evades the expression of the protein and represses the pathway generating an alteration of the cell processes and the normal cell evolves into a cancer cell.Another function associated to the DNA methylation is the intragenic regions and repetitive elements. The principal role of this modification is to repress the transcriptional noise from alternative start regions, inhibit antisense transcription or the RNA splicing. In cancer has been reported an hypomethylation of the repetitive elements which provides the chromosome aberrations during the replication process such as translocations. Moreover, the activation of the alternative start regions or a different splicing method can generate a truncate protein and alternate the normal function of the signal pathway related to the original protein.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is controlled by a differentially methylated region that is also an imprinting control region. This imprinting control region is differentially methylated at its CpGs according to parental inheritance. On the one hand, the paternal allele has a methylation which blocks the transcription factor CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and H19 region. As a result, there is no expression of the the long noncoding RNA H19 and allows the expression of the Igf2. On the other hand, the maternal allele the H19 region is unmetylated and the expression of the Igf2 cannot be activated because the enhancers cannot acces to the Igf2 region. The loss of imprinting of the Igf2 gene is the most common epigenetic alteration in the Wilm’s Tumor, that alteration provides the expression of the Igf2 gene in both alleles. Therefore, the Igf2 is overexpressed and the groth promoting action of the protein is upregulated generating the cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitabine is a drug which acts to the DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), this enzyme is responsible to add the methyl group to the GpG di-nucleotides. Some diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia and myelodisplastic syndrome seem to accumulate higher levels of DNA methylation during tumor progression as a result of mutations of the TET proteins implicated in the DNA demethilation or in other proteins related to the methylation control. This alteration can generate epigenetic defects on cell control growing proteins. Decitabine inhibits the DNMT action reducing the methylation levels where can generate an anti-tumor effect and reduce the inhibition of some important proteins which can reduce the disease effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic modifications are stable in the genome and the DNA methylation or other modifications can be inherited during the cell division or mitosis. However, if we alter some of the epigenetic structure it will generate a modification which can persist during the time because of the mitotic inheritance. Despite the fact, there are two reprogramming periods during the human development where the epigenetic marks are removed and established again. These sensitive periods are vulnerable and the environment can alter the epigenetic marks during the reprogramming period. This two periods are after the implantation and during the formation of the primordial germ cells for the formation of the gametes. Epigenetic modifications during these sensitive periods could affect to the reprogramming period and alter the real outcome of the epigenetic marks. Moreover, an alteration in the gametes could affect to offspring’s epigenetic marks by meiotic inheritance and a bad consequences to the progeny.</p></div>
