    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In general, CpG islands in healthy cells/tissues are not methylated allowing the expression of tumor supressor genes, but in cancerous cells/tissues CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, being this one of the mechanisms to disrupt the expression of tumor supression genes. This methyletion swap is increasingly found with age.</p>
<p>On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated in healthy cells/tissues avoiding expression from poor promoters and keeping genomic stability, but in cancerous cells/tissues those elements are not methylated, thus allowing recombination of repetitive elements and so increasing genomic instability, and also allowing the expression of oncogenic genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In healthy cells/tissues the H19/Igf2 ICR is methylated in the paternal allele and so it doesn't allow the insulator CTCF to bind; that way the enhancers will promote the expression of Igf2 instead of H19. On the other hand, the ICR is not methylated in the maternal allele, and so CTCF will bind; that way the enhancers won't be able to promote the expression of Igf2 but they will promote the expression of H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor the maternal allele is methylated too, and so the enhancers will promote the expression for Igf2 both in the maternal and the paternal alleles, having double expression of this growing promoter. This is an early phase event in a neoplastic process.</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. This means that Decitabine will work against DNA methylation, preventing the events related with DNA hypermethylation, such as tumor supressor silencing. The expression of tumor supressor genes will lead to the cancer cell destruction through cell death.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylaition is mitotically inheritable thanks to the action of DNA methytransferases (DNMT) enzymes, that will keep the methylation patterns after cell division. Those patterns are set during precise moments in development known as sensitive periods.</p>
<p>There are 2 sensitive periods during development: during primordial germ cells development and during preimplantational embrionic phase. The first one is important for the reprogramming of maternal and paternal imprinting in the gametes during which maternal and paternal inherited alleles will be imprinted to fit the individual gender pattern as well as for the general imprinting of other genes. The second one provides only maternal and paternal imprinting reprogrammation.</p>
<p>Treating patiens with epigenetic drugs during any of these phases (puberty or early phase of pregnancy) would alter these reprogramming processes and so have long range effect in the progeny, as those alterations would be kept durin all their lives.</p></div>
