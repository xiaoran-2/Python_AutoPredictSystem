<p class="hg-tinymce-code">(1)The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands found on promoters is to repress the expression of the gene under the control of the promoter. In normal cells the CpG islands at promoters are generally hypomethylated. DNA methylation at CpG is also seen in case of imprinting. (2) In cancer cells, high levels of methylation at CpG islands is observed and this termed as CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype). CpG island shores(2kb around the CpG) are also hypermethylated (3) In Cancer cells since the promoters (which are CpG island rich) are hypermethylated the genes under their control are not expressed. Thus some essential tumour suppressor genes may also not be expressed which leads to illegitimate proliferation of cells. (4)  In normal cells DNA is methylated at regions such as repeats, transposons, and intergenic elements to maintain genomic integrity by preventing harmful processes such as illegitimate recomination and transposition by silencing them. The  cryptic promoters found in intergenic regions are also silenced by DNA methylation. (5) However in cancer cells though regional hypermethylations are found (at CpG islands) a general genome wide hypomethylation is found. So the intergenic regions and repeats are hypomethylated. However Hassler et al quote that than genome wide, localised hypomethylation is seen in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours. (6) The resulting global hypomethylation promotes illegitimate recombination and transposition and activation of cryptic promoter sites in these intergenic regions and repeats.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

<p>(1) In case of the H19/Igf2 cluster the imprint control region (ICR) of the paternal allele is methylated. This methylation prevents the binding of a protein called CTCF to this region. CTCF prevents expression of Igf2 by diverting the enhancers of this gene to H19 gene. If CTCF is not present as is the case here, Igf2 is actively expressed. (2) The ICR region in maternal allele is unmethylated and thus CTCF can bind to this region and block the expression of the Igf2 gene. (3) In case of Wilm's Tumour the ICR on both the paternal and maternal allele is methylated and hence CTCF does'nt bind to both ICRs and so Igf2 is expressed from both the allele. (4) Since Igf2 gene product is growth promoting, expression of two copies instead of one, leads to illegitimate proliferation of cells and creates a tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

<p>(1) Decitabine belong to the class of Hypomethylation agents (DNA-demethylating agents). It is a cytidine analog (antimetabolite) and it inactivates DNA methyl transferases. (2) Once incorporated into DNA they block the DNA methyl transferses and on succesive rounds of replication reduce the Methylation of the CpG dinucleotide. In short it leads to hypomethylation. (3) Since the methylation on the promoters of essential tumour suppressor genes is now removed by the action of the drug, the cells now express these tumour suppressor genes and hence induce a general anti tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

I have numbered them only for easy evaluation. Even when read without these numbers as a prose, the paragraph is written to be meaningful and address the questions.</p>
<p>(1) Since the epigenetic modifications such as the DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and passed through the cell divisions they confer a stable heritable positive effect on the clone of cells descending from the the originally treated cells. (2) Sensitive period involves certain times during development when we are highly susceptible to epigentic alterations by environment. (3) the sensitive periods of development include the periods when the epigentic reprogramming occurs in differentiating cells, removal and laying of X inactivation marks and periods of germ cell development. Also the period of pregnancy is a sensitive period as it may affect the fetus (4) Since the patients are highly susceptible to environmental intereference during these periods, treating these patients with epigentic modifiers may lead to establishment and inadvertant amplification of wrong epigentic marks and interfere with normal development. </p></div>
