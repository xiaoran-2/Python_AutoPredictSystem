    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to suppress gene expression in surrounding areas, although very little methylation normally occurs in CpG islands.</p>
<p>In cancer, there is an increase of methylation at CpG islands, leading to the suppression of many genes that are normally expressed in non-cancerous cells, including tumour-suppressor genes.  As a cancer progresses, more methylation at CpG islands is seen, and methylation spreads to surrounding regions.</p>
<p>At intergenic regions and repetitive elements, the normal situation is a high level of DNA methylation, which suppresses transcription, but in cancer these regions tend to lose methylation, leading to high levels of genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the Imprint Control Region is methylated, which prevents binding of the insulator protein CTCF.  This means that the downstream enhancers have access to the Igf2 gene, which is activated. In addition, the methylation of the ICR tends to spread to the promotor of H19, ensuring that it is not expressed.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the Imprint Control Region is not methylated, so CTCF can bind, insulating Igf2 from the enhancers, which instead have access to H19, ensuring its expression.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster will cause improper expression of both the Igf2 gene and the H19 RNA transcript. Igf2 is an insulin-like growth factor, and over-expression can contribute to unregulated growth of the cell.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour, a cancer of the kidney which affects children, is associated with loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 ICF, causing overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth promoter and therefore an oncogene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, meaning that it removes DNA methylation.</p>
<p>Decitabine is incorporated into the DNA during upon replication, and irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferase, so inhibiting methylation.</p>
<p>Because the drug only has an effect during replication, this means that rapidly dividing cells will be affected by it much more severely than slowly dividing ones, which has the effect of targeting cancer cells more than non-cancerous ones.</p>
<p>Decitabine has an anti-tumour effect by reversing the gene silencing that results from DNA methylation on tumour suppressor genes that occurs in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altered DNA methylation will be mitotically heritable, so even after the period of drug treatment, the effects of the drug will last for several cell divisions until the alteration in DNA methylation is diluted.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is any period in development when epigenetic marks are actively being laid down or altered.  There are two sensitive periods in normal development.  One is just after fertilisation of the oocyte, up to just after implantation, when the blastocyst is re-organising the epigenetic marks, removing the ones relevant to germ cells and establishing the ones relevant to a developing embryo.  The other is during the period when primordial germ cells are being produced, which are derived from somatic cells, but need their epigenome reprogrammed to be appropriate for sperm and egg cells.</p>
<p>Giving drug therapy that alters DNA methylation during a sensitive period would be a bad idea, as it would disrupt the epigenetic reprogramming, with potentially fatal consequences for the developing foetus.  Such drugs should not be given to pregnant women for this reason.</p></div>
