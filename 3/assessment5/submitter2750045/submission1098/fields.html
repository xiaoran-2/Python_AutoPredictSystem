    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).  It functions to reduce the methylation of DNA i.e. it is a hypomethylating agent.  It achieves this through its incorporation into DNA as it is a nucleoside analog or more precisely a cytidine analog.  When incorporated into the DNA of mitotic cells in place of normal cytidine it inhibits DNA methyltransferases by forming covalent bonds with them.  This leads to demethylation of the corresponding regions of DNA.  Certain tumors are caused by hypermethylation of CpG islands associated with tumor suppressor genes.  Decitabine has the ability to reduce this methylation thereby increasing expression of the affected tumor suppressor and restoring its normal function in a mitotically heritable manner.  It is currently used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects as it is a mitotically heritable epigenetic mark.  Thus methylation can be propagated through multiple generations of dividing cells.  A sensitive period in development in epigenetic terms is a time when methylation is being actively erased and replaced in epigenetic reprogramming.  This occurs during primordial germ cell development and also in early embryonic development during pregnancy. Treating patients during pregnancy would be inadvisable as drugs affecting the epigenetic machinery would have the potential to disrupt many or all embryonic cells and have dramatic or unpredicable effects.  On the other hand, treating outside of these sensitive periods means cells in general are less susceptible to epigenetic disruption while actively dividing cells such as cancer cells are highly susceptible and the effects of the drugs are more focused to damage neoplastic cells and leave normal cells unaffected or minimally effected.  The effects on children could also be more pronounced as their germ cells are in active development and large scale epigenetic disruption has the potential for adverse effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are promoter associated and DNA methlyation at these regions normally functions to reduce or inhibit gene expression.  Generally these regions exist in a hypomethylated state however in cancer, hypermethylation of these regions and in CpG islands is observed.  This hypermethlation can affect tumor suppressor genes by inhbiting their expression and thus their anti-tumor effects leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and contributing to cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements serves to protect the integrity of the genome by inhibiting the transposition of transposable elements and protecting repetitive elements from undesired pairing with homologous regions of DNA.  In cancer, hypomethylation of these regions is observed.  This hypomethylation means that transposable elements are able to reinsert themselves in other regions of the genome and cuase disruption to the sequence of other genes or their promoters.  This can cause aberrant gene expression or affect the structure of the genes' RNA or protein products thus leading to altered function and potentially disease.  Unprotected repetitive elements can bind to homologous regions throughout the genome and this can lead to errors in DNA replication leading to changes in chromosome copy number or translocation.  Amplification or deletion of chromosomes of genes again has pathogenic potential by altering the normal level of expression of genes.  Similarly translocations can disrupt or fuse genes or their promoters and can lead to altered levels of expression or expression of entirely new protein products that contribute to disease through disruption of normal cell function.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is the monoallelic expression of a gene from a single parental chromosome due to epigenetic silencing of the second allele.  In cancer, normal silencing can be disrupted leading to either inhibition of both copies of a growth inhibiting gene or alternatively expression of both copies of a growth promoting gene.    In the case of the H19/Igf2 locus, the paternal H19/Igf2 imprint control region (ICR) is generally methylated.  This methylation prevents CTCF from binding to a nearby insulator element and creating a phyisical barrier that would stop downstream enhancers from augmenting the effects of the Igf2 promoter.  Thus the paternal H19 is silenced and the promoters act on Igf2 causing its expression.  The maternal ICR is unmethylated and CTCF binds to the insulator element blocking the effects of the enhancers on Igf2.  Thus the downstream enhancers act on H19 to bring about its expression while Igf2 is inhibited.  In the case of Wilm's tumor, there is aberrant, increased methylation of the maternal ICR meaning that Igf2 is expressed from both the maternal and paternal alleles.  Igf2 is a growth factor and increased expression causes aberrant cell growth which contributes to cancer.</p></div>
