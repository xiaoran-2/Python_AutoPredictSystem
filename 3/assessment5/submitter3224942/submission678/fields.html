    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a biochemical process involving the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine or adenine DNA nucleotides. DNA methylation stably alters the expression of genes in cells as cells divide and differentiate from embryonic stem cells into specific tissues. The resulting change is normally permanent and unidirectional, preventing one organism from reverting to a stem cell or converting into another type of tissue. DNA methylation is typically removed during zygote formation and re-established through successive cell divisions during development. However, the latest research shows that hydroxylation of methyl groups occurs rather than complete removal of methyl groups in zygote. Some methylation modifications that regulate gene expression are inheritable and cause genomic imprinting.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">In addition, DNA methylation suppresses the expression of endogenous retroviral genes and other harmful stretches of DNA that have been incorporated into the genome of the host over time. It also forms the basis of chromatin structure, which enables a single cell to grow into multiple organs or perform multiple functions. DNA methylation also plays a crucial role in the development of nearly all types of cancer.</span></p>

DNA methylation is essential during embryonic development, and in somatic cells, patterns of DNA methylation are generally transmitted to daughter cells with a high fidelity. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns - hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue - have been associated with a large number of human malignancies. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>This imprinting control region is differentially methylated at its CpGs according to parental inheritance. Usually, the paternal copy of H19 is methylated and silent while the maternal copy is hypomethylated or unmethylated and expressed in the offspring cell. Methylation of the H19 promoter is negatively correlated with H19 expression.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Imprinted alleles are silenced such that the genes are either expressed <strong>only</strong> from the non-imprinted allele inherited from the mother (e.g. <em>H19</em>), or in other instances from the non-imprinted allele inherited from the father (e.g. <em>IGF-2</em>) In humans, germline-derived or post-zygotically acquired imprinting defects at IC1 are associated with aberrant activation or repression of </span><em style="font-size:14px;">IGF2</em><span style="font-size:14px;">, resulting in the congenital growth disorders Beckwith-Wiedemann (BWS) and Silver-Russell (SRS) syndromes, respectively. In Wilms tumour and colorectal cancer, biallelic expression of </span><em style="font-size:14px;">IGF2</em><span style="font-size:14px;"> has been observed in association with loss of methylation at a DMR in </span><em style="font-size:14px;">IGF2.</em><span style="font-size:14px;"> This DMR, known as DMR0, has been shown to be methylated on the silent maternal </span><em style="font-size:14px;">IGF2</em><span style="font-size:14px;"> allele presumably with a role in repression.</span></p>
<p><span><span>In Wilms tumour, however, methylation profiles of IC1 and </span><em>IGF2</em><span> DMR0 are indicative of methylation changes occurring on both parental alleles rather than in </span><em>cis</em><span>.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the potential therapeutic partners are drugs that affect cytosine methylation in genomic DNA. Both hypermethylation and hypomethylation are well documented in cancer cells compared with their normal cells of origin. Hypermethylated CpG islands attract methyl-CpG binding domain proteins and recruit HDACs, all of which inhibits transcription. Decitabine has produced an increased rate of clinical response and improved quality of life in clinical trials in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which led to their approval for the treatment of MDS.</p>
<p>Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold. It works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</p>
<p>Decitabine belongs to the antimetabolites. When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a chemical process that adds a methyl group to DNA. CpG sites are methylated by one of three enzymes called DNA methyltransferases. Inserting methyl groups changes the appearance and structure of DNA, modifying a gene's interactions with the machinery within a cell's nucleus that is needed for transcription. DNA methylation is used in some genes to differentiate which gene copy is inherited from the father and which gene copy is inherited from the mother, a phenomenon known as imprinting.</p>
<p><span><span>Epigenetic changes are required for normal development and health, they can also be responsible for some disease states. Disrupting any of the three systems that contribute to epigenetic alterations can cause abnormal activation or silencing of genes. Such disruptions have been associated with </span><span class="ontologyTermLink">cancer</span><span>, syndromes involving chromosomal instabilities, and mental retardation.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Although DNA methylation is involved in normal development, aging and gene regulation, altered methylation patterns have been associated with disease. It is generally believed that early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. The purpose of this review is to outline the contribution of epigenetic mechanisms to genomic function, particularly in the development of complex behavioral phenotypes, focusing on the sensitive periods.</span></p></div>
