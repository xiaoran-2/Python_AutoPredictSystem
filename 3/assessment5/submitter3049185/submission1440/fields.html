    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are the areas rich in Cs and Gs. They are found before genes and they are not to be methylated when a gene must be active. In the case of it happening, (In the so called CpG island shores) the gene would be instantly silenced.</p>
<p>This leads us to think that the disruption of this rule or system may lead to instability and downregulation of complete silencing of a specific gene, that in some cases, could just be a tumor suppressing gene that can lead to the development of cancer, although, more than 1 gene or epigenetic mark has to be altered in order to become a cancer cell, since the “Proof Reading” or other processes may correct the insult.</p>
<p>In cancer, things happen the opposite way, the genes that are “behind the bars”, so to speak, are released, while some of the “guardians” get locked in because of methylations in their CpG islands.</p>
<p>DNA is methylated for a reason, and that is to maintain everything under control.</p>
<p>For example: Repetitive elements, as the word says, they are repetitive and very similar one to another, so in several cases they could be capable of binding one to another, but in that sense, life wouldn’t be possible because of the instability that model proposes, to fix this, the cell puts several methylation marks in the repetitive elements so that they wont be read or translocated, like in CML and the Philadelphia Chromosome.</p>
<p>Other examples of methylation disruption are the hypermethylation of the RB gen in Retinoblastoma or MGMT whereas the tumor suppressing capabilities get silenced, while other proto-oncogenes, gain function of immortality or angiogenesis with the hypomethylation of certain genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells have the classic feature of loss of imprinting, they no longer express this specific marks, but rather, they express both parental alleles or they silence them both.</p>
<p>This is relevant to us because this overexpressing of genes will lead to a tumor because of an upregulation in growth genes.</p>
<p>In this case we are gonna talk about hypermethylation of the Igf2/H19 cluster.</p>
<p>In normal conditions, the paternal allele will have the imprinted control region (ICR) turned off, with H19, whereas, in the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated so the enhancers can act on the H19 gene in order to “activate” it, but Igf2 is turned off on the mother´s allele.</p>
<p>This means that enhancers would activate Igf2 in the paternal allele, but not on the maternal.</p>
<p>But in cancer, we loose this specific marks, both alleles would have the same silencing, in this case, the CTCF and H19, loosing the regulation of Igf2.</p>
<p>But that’s not the only problem, since we would now have 2 active Igf2 genes with their enhancers upregulating their expression and therefore increasing proliferation, since Igf2 is enrolled in growth and proliferation and this is associated with Wilm´s tumour, </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a DNM Transferase inhibitor, functions by binding irreversibly to DNMTs when they are incorporated to the DNA.</p>
<p>Allthough the mechanism of action remains unclear (whether it starts acting in the plasma or nucleus, and where in the nucleus), it has the potential to stop demethylation from happening in cancer cells, which is a common feature in cancer and indirectly restores the previous methylation stability in the complete genome. This has the special feature to stop oncogenes of being activated and get back to their previous state if possible.</p>
<p>The problem is that it is not that specific, so it will bind to other DNMTs too, and therefore causing damage to other cells and even inducing another type of cancer.</p>
<p>Decitabine and other epigenetic regulators are more effective in liquid tumours because they don’t have to penetrate them and therefore give a better outcome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The real problem, as explained before, is the lack of specificity, for example DNMT inhibitors, that would bind to DNMTs of other normal cells and after their division, they would come along to the new cell, but turned of and therefore, provoking instability, because DNMT would not be able to demethylate and possibly develop another type of sickness or translocation due to the repetitive elements flying naked against each other.</p>
<p>When to use this kinds of drugs? When everything fails.</p>
<p>When the patient is no more responding to the chemotherapy, then is the time to use DNMTis.</p>
<p>The problem is that some cancers are context specific, meaning that the role of DNA methylation in cancer depends on the tumour type and the stage of the disease.</p>
<p>If the tumour works by the activating mutation or the inactivating mutation could mean the end for the patient, one first must know the origin of the cancer and the stage before starting with any treatment that involves playing with the epigenome.</p></div>
