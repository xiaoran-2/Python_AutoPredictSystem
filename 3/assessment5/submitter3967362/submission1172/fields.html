    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation  promotes the densely packed chromatine stucture - heterochromatine, which makes the gene less available for transription enzymes and  prevents transription of a gene.</p>
<p>Normally, CpG islands are not methylated, as they are supposed to be in gene promoters. When methylated, CpG islands silence the gene. In cancer DNA is hypomethylated in general but hypetmethylated in CpG islands. Hypermethylation of CpG islands leads to silencing of the high number of genes, some of which are tumor supressor genes and apoptosis genes. It increases the chances of a cancer cell to survive, escape apoptosis and proliferate.</p>
<p>However, intergenic regions and repetetive elements are usually  methylated in a normal cell. It makes the genom more stable as repetetive elements are here to prevent mistakes during mitosis: transposition, translocation, deletion which may lead to abnormal functioning of genes. Methylated (and often with mutated Cytosine to Thymine) regions prevent the transcription of the aberrant gene. In a cancer cell long regions of DNA, including gene bodies and intergenic regions and repetitive elements, tend to be hypomethylated. This leads to accumulation of aberrations in gene expression and loss of cell tissue specificity.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is an alternative mechanism to mutation and is mitotically heritable. As well as mutations, changes in epigenom also contribute to accumulation of mistakes in gene machinery. DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements can be both the cause and effect of tumor genesis in different cancer at different stages.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some of the genes are imprinted which means that they are expressed only from one of the alleles: either paternal or maternal. In cancer the normally imprinted (e.g.silenced) gene may be expressed due to changes in epigenom - this  loss of imprinting  happens because of changes in methylation pattern.</p>
<p>Igf2 and H19 are genes which are closely located and imprinted, Igf2 - maternally (methylated on the maternal allele, expressed from paternal allele), H19 - paternally (methylated on the paternal allele, expressed from maternal allele). In many cancers the Igf2 gene loses imprinting and is expressed from both alleles, while H19 gene on the maternal allele becomes methylated and silenced.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor changes in epigenom are restricted to Igf2/H19 locus. Igf2 maternal allele acquires paternal methylation pattern (loss of methylation in a centre which acts in cis, activating the gene promoters). Igf2 and H19 are depend on the enhancers located downstream of H19, acting in cis. If H19 is silent, enhancers may reach Igf2, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting cluster leads to overexpression of Igf2 gene and tumorgenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylation agent,  used in treatment of myelodysplasia and leukaemia. Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase which catalyses the attachment of methyl groups to DNA. DNA methyltransferases are active by mitosis, methylating the unmethylated strand of DNA of a daughter cell.</p>
<p>In many blood and immune system cancers enzyme EZH2 becomes hyperactive. It methylates histone tails and converts euchromatin into heterochromatin, silencing lots of genes among which are tumor supressor genes. Demethylation of tumor supressor genes thus leads to activation of tumor supressors, apoptosis and death of cancer cells. </p>
<p>Demethylation of DNA may be passive (by mitosis) and active (through enzymes). </p>
<p>Decitabine may have anti-tumor effect due to a) activation of previuosly silenced tumor supressors; b)leading to cell death of daughter cancer cells after mitosis due to aberration in gene expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, any drugs altering DNA methylation may have long-lasting effects on the epigenom. By mitosis one of the DNA strands of a daughter cell is methylated de-novo, that's why any impacts on the process of methylation will cause an effect on the new cell. For example, inhibiting DNA-methyltransferase by cell division may result in the death of the cell or aberrations in its development as genes will be misexpressed.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods when epigenome is removed and then set de-novo. These are periods in embrionic development (before implantation of the foetus) and period of development of primordial germ cells (in teenagers and in foetuses as well). Any negative influence on epigenome may be fatal or have adverse effects on future generations. So, it is better to avoid treatment with DNA-methylation agents during sensitive periods: before and during pregnancy and in teenagers.</p></div>
