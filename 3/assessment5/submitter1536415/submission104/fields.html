    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting of genes is an epigenetic mechanism that selectively silences gene expression from either the maternal or the paternal allele (thereby achieving monoallelic gene expression). In a <strong>normal (healthy) cell</strong>, the methylation pattern of the paternal and maternal allele of the H19/IGF2 cluster is as follows: The imprint control region (ICR) of the <strong>maternal allele is unmethylated</strong>. Therefore, the insulator element CTCF can bind at the ICR and the enhancers (located downstream) act on H19. As a result of this methylation pattern, H19 transcription is enabled from the maternal allele whereas IGF2 transcription is blocked. In contrast to the maternal allele, the ICR on the <strong>paternal allele is methylated </strong>(or "paternally imprinted"), preventing CTCF from binding. Therefore, the enhancers act on IGF2 instead of H19 and IGF2 is transcribed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In patients with <strong>Wilm’s tumor</strong> (a childhood kidney cancer), <strong>both alleles have the paternal methylation pattern</strong>, i.e. both the maternal and the paternal allele are methylated at the ICR. Therefore, <strong>the growth promoting IGF2 is transcribed from both alleles</strong>, resulting in an increased dose of the IGF2 protein that contributes to aberrant cell growth and tumor development. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation at CpG islands:</strong> In a <strong>healthy cell</strong>, CpG mehylation is rare. If a CpG island is methylated (methyl group added to 5’ carbon of the cytosine) it usually means gene silencing since CpG islands are often in the promoter region of genes and the methyl group can for example prevent transcription factors from binding and initiating gene transcription. <strong>In cancer cells</strong>, CpG island methylation increases from hyperplasia to neoplasm to invasive tissue. This is often associated with <strong>silencing of tumor suppressor genes</strong> and can thereby promote tumorigenesis. Since epimutations are mitotically heritable and rapidly selected for (i.e. cells with the epigenetic mark grow faster or die less), the tumor cells gain an advantage over healthy cells. </p>
<p><strong>DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repeats: </strong>In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells tend to be hypomethylated (less methylation than in a normal cell). <strong>In a healthy cell</strong>, methylation at repetitive elements supports compacting heterochromatin and can prevent “illegitimate” recombination (i.e. translocation between elements of the genome that are not identical/similar) and transposition (copy and insert somewhere else in the genome). Therefore, methylation in these regions is important to ensure genomic stability in healthy cells. <strong>In cancer cells</strong>, hypomethylation at repeats can enable illegitimate recombination as well as allow the repeats to transpose.  As a result, in cancer cells, there is an increased likelihood to have deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations and therefore <strong>increased genomic instability</strong>. </p>
<p>Both epigenetic mechanisms - <strong>CpG hypermethylation</strong> in the promotors of tumor suppressor genes (resulting in decreased expression of these “protective” genes) and <strong>hypomethylation at repeats and intergenic regions</strong> (resulting in genomic instability) - can therefore contribute to cancer development and progression. Which of the two mechanisms is the primary driver of tumorigenesis depends on the type of tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (Dacogen) is a demethylating agent acting by <strong>inhibiting DNA methyltransferase</strong>.  DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) are important for establishing and maintaining the epigenome because they lay down epigenetic marks. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue. It gets incorporated into the DNA and then irreversibly "traps" DNMT when the methyltransferase is trying to methylate the daughter strand in a dividing cell. The effects of decitabine are therefore <strong>replication dependent</strong>. </p>
<p>By inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, decitabine can <strong>counteract DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands</strong> (for example in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes) and thereby reverse the silencing of these "protective" genes observed in tumor cells. While the effect is not specific and affets DNMT activity generally, it is replication dependent.  Since cancer cells divide faster than healthy cells, the effects of DNMT inhibitors appears to <strong>more strongly affect cancer cells than healthy cells</strong> and are effective in the low dose (non-cytotocix) range.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modifications are <strong>mitotically heritable</strong> and passed on to daughter cells. Therefore, the effect of the drug may be lasting even after treatment is stopped. This could be beneficial as the treated cancer cells will keep their “reset” methylation pattern and act more like normal cells even when the drug is no longer present. However, treatment may also lead to <strong>long-lasting side effects</strong> when applied during<strong> “sensitive periods”</strong> of development.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is <strong>a time when previous epigenetic marks are cleared and new ones are established</strong>. This occurs most prominently during the preimplantation period of pregnancy when epigenetic marks from the sperm and oozyte are erased to <strong>achieve pluripotency</strong> and then <strong>reset in a cell specific manner after implantation</strong>. A second sensitive period is seen during <strong>primordial germ cell (PGC) development</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus, it would be dangerous to treat female patients who are pregnant because at this stage, treatment may disturb cell lineage development in the child. A drug applied at that time might also <strong>interfere with PGC development</strong> in the child and affect future generations. Some reprogramming also occurs in <strong>postnatal life</strong> so that caution must also be taken when treating very young cancer patients.</p></div>
