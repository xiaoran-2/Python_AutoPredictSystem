    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, there are two trends in methylation patterns. CpG Islands are generally hypomethylated, while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally hypermethylated. As the person ages, there is also an increase in CGI methylation. When DNA becomes methylated, the genes become silenced and inactive. The DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is thought to help maintain genomic stability in normal cells by preventing transposition, transcriptional interference and illegitimate recombination. This form of DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and can be removed during sensitive periods of development.</p>
<p>In cancerous cells, these trends are reversed so the CpG islands are hypermethylated and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. Again, the hypermethylation serves to silence the particular gene or genes and in the case of cancer often leads to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. The hypermethylation of these areas can be one of several hits required for cancer to occur, as stated in the Knudson Hypothesis. Furthermore, each cancer can be a result of the hypermethylation of CGI’s affecting a single gene or a set of genes, as seen with CIMP.  Furthermore, it has been shown that the areas surrounding the CpG islands are also hypermethylated in cancer, which may be an indicator of expression patterns in the various types of cancers. The level of CGI hypermethylation can be used as a biomarker for the tumor type or sub-type, the identification of the primary tumor location and as a marker for prognosis.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions results in genomic instability in cancerous cells. Hypomethylation can also occur at CpG poor promoters, which will result in the activation of oncogenes. The issues mentioned above, which DNA methylation normally prevents, can now occur much more often. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at imprint control regions can be altered through hypomethylation or hypermethylation and results in different types of cancers depending on where and how the region is affected. The hypermethylation of the H19/Igf2 causes a loss of imprinting and leads to the overexpression of Igf2 and a type of tumor known as Wilm’s tumor.  In a normal cell, the ICR is unmethylated on the maternal copy of the gene. In combination with the CTCF activity, this allows the enhancers (downstream of the ICR) to act on H19 and prevent expression of Igf2. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated. This prevents the enhancers from working on H19 and allows the expression of Igf2. In Wilm’s tumor, however, there is methylation of the ICR on both alleles. This leads to Igf2 expression from both alleles, resulting in an overexpression. Overexpression of Igf2, a growth factor, will then lead to tumor growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In many cancers, the enzymes controlling the methylation of DNA become extremely hyperactive resulting in the hypermethylation and therefore silencing of tumor suppressor genes. DNA methyltransferases have enzyme domains involved in the methylation of DNA, which can be altered in cancers. Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor used to treat myodysplastic syndrome progressed to AML. This class of drugs typically includes nucleoside analogues, which irreversibly bind DNMT once they are incorporated into the DNA. In order for the nucleoside analogues to become incorporated into the DNA, it requires a dividing cell to function properly. Tumor cells are dividing quite rapidly allowing the DNMTi’s to target these cells more efficiently than other cells types.  At low doses, these drugs result in DNA demethylation and expression of tumor suppressor genes, resulting in the decline in tumor growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification ,which is mitotically heritable. This means that once this epigenetic pattern is layed down on the genome of one cell, all of its daughter cells will have this same pattern of DNA methylation. Therefore, doctors may not want to treat patients when they are at sensitive periods in their development, where these marks can be removed. There are two main periods, the first is in early development and the second is during primordial germ cell development. During these periods, epigenetic reprogramming occurs, where DNA methylation marks are removed from the paternal and maternal genome sparing imprinted genes and IAP’s. If a cancer patient was treated with epigenetic drugs during either of these time periods could have long lasting effects on DNA methylation patterns in generations to come. These changes can be beneficial in synergistic treatments combining chemotherapeutics and epigenetic modifying drugs, but can certainly have risks that outweigh the benefits. </p></div>
