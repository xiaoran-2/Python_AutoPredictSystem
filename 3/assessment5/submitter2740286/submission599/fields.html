    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells DNA methylation of CpG islands is usually not present universally, but differs cell type to cell type, although in a low level. It is normally present in context of epigenetic control of development or in other words it arises with differrentiation of cells during specific tissue and organ development and remains different in different tissues. However in cancer cells there is an overall hypermethylation of CpG islands which increases as the cancer develops. Since methylation of a certain locus usually means silencing, many cancer suppressing genes also remain silent.</p>
<p>On the other hand, intergenic regions are mostly methylated in normal cells, again according to cell type. In cancer the methylation is reduced with the progress of cancer. Demethylation on the other hand increases transcription of previously silenced genes, which disrupts normal development, gradually erases epigenetic state of the cell. Previously silenced oncogenes can thusly be expressed. Transposons, normally silenced are expressed in cancer when demethylated and can cause large cromosomal aberations (Inversions, deletions, translocations) and general genomic instability.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells paternal allelle of H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated thusly: ICR (imprint control region) is methylated, which in turn enables methylation and inhibition of transcription of H19: With H19 methylated, Igf2 can be expressed.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele ICP is unmethylated, which enables a factor CTCF to bind on it. Therefore H19 is unmethylated and expressed, which in turn inhibits expression of Igf2 through enhancers located downstream of H19. During early development both alleles express Igf2 (insulin growth factor 2), but later the allele becomes imprinted as described above (only expressed on paternal allele).</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour both alleles express Igf2 and because the allele acts in growth promotion, two doses of Igf2 cause development of cancer due to overgrowth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA - demethylating agents and it inhibits and reduces DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase presumably on locuses with cancer supressor genes, since methylation usually means gene silencing. Since silencing of cancer supressor genes is also one way to cause cancer, enabling expression of those genes can have an anti tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, meaning that it is stable during cell division. It means that once established, induced changes to DNA methylation remain permanent until the death of the cell as well as in all daugher cells. This means that tumours can be completely stopped from spreading without killing of cells.</p>
<p>A sensitive period in epigenetic development is a period when there is large scale methylation or demethylation in progress. There are two such periods in epigenetic development:</p>
<ol><li>Early embrionic development (up until the forming of epiblast)</li>
<li>Primordial germ cells development and germ cells development</li>
</ol><p>Therefore treatment of pregnant women (1 and partly 2 - PGC) and children prior to sexual maturation (2) is not advised, since proper methylation is not yet fixed. First period would endanger the developing fetus, while the second would mostly enganger future generations, since germ cells are going through epigenetic reprogramming.</p></div>
