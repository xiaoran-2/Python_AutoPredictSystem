    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is to regulate the transcription of genes. Hypermethylation of CpG islands at promoter region leads to silencing of the gene whereas hypomethylation leads to activation of gene trasncription. A <span>local DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands result in silencing of genes, including tumor suppressor genes and housekeeping genes, which are essential for control of cell proliferation. DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements are important for inhibition of their movement and being integrated into exogenic regions of the genome (i.e., maintain genomic integrity). In cancer cells, repetitive elemets contain less DNA methylation compared to normal cells, leading to disintegration of the genome (i.e., unstable genome). </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>ICR of H19/Igf2 regulates the expression of the paternally-expressed gene IGF2 and the maternallyexpressed ncRNA H19. ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. Loss of imprinting of Igf2, H19 and methylation of the H19 promoter leads to Wilms' tumor. <span>In tumors, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth. Loss of imprinting of H19 on the maternal chromosome, when it occurs, could occur independently or could be influenced by events in the paternal chromosome.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs which inhibit DNA methyltransferase, although chemically it is a cytidine anologue. It leads to a decrease of DNA hypomethylation. It can have an effect on the hypermethylation at CpG islands of important genes, especially promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes and DNA repair genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation are inhereted during mitosis (DMNT3 methylates the sister chromosome); therfore if the mother strand was unmethylated at the beginning, DMNT3 can't recognise the new strand as unmethylated (i.e., no marker). Sensitive periods are when epigenetic marks are removed during epigenetic reprogramming in germ cells and early development and active remodelling of epigenetic marks during differentiation. During pregnancy, it would be indavisable to treat patients with these kind of drugs (genomic imprinting). </p></div>
