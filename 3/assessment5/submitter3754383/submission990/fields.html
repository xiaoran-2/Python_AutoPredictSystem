    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic phenomenon that happens almost exclusively at regions dense in cytosine-guanine dinucleotides at gene promoters, called CpG islands, which are normally unmethylated. It occurs when a methyl group attaches to the 5’ position on the cytosine. Its normal function is to silence gene expression. In cancer, DNA methylation at CpG islands is disrupted in that the promoters of tumour suppressor genes become hypermethylated – more than expected - reducing their expression. For example, hypermethylation has been found in the tumour suppressor genes RB (retinoblastoma), MLH1 and MGMT (colorectal cancer) and BRCA1 (breast cancer).  This higher-than-expected methylation pattern is a recognised phenotype in cancer – the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). Hypermethylation of the two kilobase regions upstream and downstream of CpG islands, called CpG island shores, has also been associated with many cancers.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the genome are usually methylated, to prevent gene expression. This promotes genomic stability by regulating the expression of transposable elements, which are mutagenic. DNA methylation is disrupted at intergenic regions and repetitive elements in that these regions are hypomethylated, and so allowed to be expressed more than expected. This genomic instability can contribute to cancer in two ways. If an already mutated oncogene becomes hypomethylated, it will express more, which in concert with other genomic and epigenomic ‘hits’ (as per the Knudson hypothesis) will contribute to the development of cancer. In addition, if a transposable element is hypomethylated, thereby allowed to express more, and goes on to mutate a proto-oncogene (i.e. make it an oncogene) it can also contribute to the disease. An example of an element that is hypomethylated and therefore overexpressed in cancer is the HOTAIR lncRNA, which regulates the methylation of histones. The overexpression leads to hypermethylation at H3K27 and H3K4 unmethylation, tightening the chromatin (and lessening the expression) of tumour suppressor genes.Enzyme mediated histone methylation and acetylation generally contributes to cancer by making chromatin tighter and looser respectively. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genetic imprinting usually results in monoallelic expression of certain genes in a parent-of-origin way. Imprinting is controlled by DNA methylation patterns at the imprinting control regions (ICRs) of the genes that are to be imprinted (e.g. the H19/Igf2 cluster). When normally imprinted, the ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated. This allows CTCF to bind to it, and so restricts the expression of Igf2, allowing the expression of H19. The ICR of the paternal allele is methylated in normal imprinting, which does not allow CTCF to bind, and so allows the expression of Igf2, and restricts the expression of H19. In Wilm’s tumor, imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted such that there is hypermethylation on the ICR of both maternal and paternal alleles. This results in the biallelic expression (i.e. overexpression) of Igf2 and no expression of H19. The product of the Igf2 gene is an insulin-like growth factor, which, as the name suggests, can contribute to the unregulated growth and proliferation of cells which is a hallmark of cancer, if overexpressed. In addition, H19 is a candidate tumour suppressor gene, and so its non-expression (in conjunction with the overexpression of Igf2) also clearly contributes to the disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that belongs to the class of drugs that are DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis). It inhibits DNA methylation by getting incorporated into the DNA and irreversibly covalently binding DNMT1 upon replication (i.e. its mechanism is replication dependent). This stops the enzyme from performing its normal function of attaching the methyl groups to cytosines, which ultimately leads to hypomethylation over time. Decitabine and other DMNTis can have an anti-tumour effect by reversing the effects of hypermethylation that are often found in the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes in cancer patients. Reducing hypermethylation at tumour suppressor loci can allow the expression of the genes to resume. The other way Decitabine and other DNMTis can have an anti-tumour effect is that, at very high doses, DNMTis are cytotoxic. This cytoxicity is non-specific, which means that both rapidly dividing/proliferating and (unfortunately) normal, healthy cells are equally targeted and destroyed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs like decitabine can have enduring effects on the epigenome in that its mechanism is to incorporate itself into dividing DNA and irreversibly bind DNMT1. These are permanent effects and so endure beyond the period of drug treatment. At a more general level, the pattern of DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, which means that the pattern (i.e. hypomethylation in the presence of a DNMTi like decitabine) is likely to be carried through each cell division. Such drug treatment is promising, but caution must be exercised when treating patients during so called ‘sensitive periods’ – periods where an alteration of the environment (including the internal environment) can have an effect on epigenetic control. Altered methylation patterns during embryogenesis and gametogenesis, for example, can have lasting effects on individuals and their offspring. Alteration of DNA methylation in plants and mice during gametogenesis has been implicated in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Human data, however, is lacking. In embryogenesis, epigenetic alterations in humans have been implicated in the later development of disease. This is the Barker hypothesis. If true, it is not inconceivable that, given its influence on cancer, alterations to DNA methylation in these sensitive periods may actually predispose individuals and/or their offspring to disease and other abnormalities. Epigenetic treatments are therefore inadvisable during these times. </p></div>
