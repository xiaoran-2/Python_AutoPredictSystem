    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in about 60% of promoters, have more CG dinucleotides than would be expected by chance, and are usually kept free of methylation regardless of the promoter's activity state. The methylation of the CpG island leads to silencing of the gene expression.  CpG island methylation also increases with age.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated and then inactive, either through the formation of a repressive chromatin structure or prohibiting transcription factor binding, which then causes the silencing of the underlying gene.  Tumour suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutations.  CGI methylation is found in all tumours studied and is one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis. CpG island shores, within 2kb of CpG islands, are also hypermethylated in cancer, so the gene promoter is unlikely to be expressed.  CpG island hypermethylation can affect a single gene, eg. RB inretinoblastoma or BRCA1 in breast cancer, or sets of genes in CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), cancers where CpG islands of sets of genes are methylated (colorectal cancer, neuroblastoma, etc.)</p>
<p>The main function of DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity.  Repeats are heavily methylated to prevent transposition, transcriptional interference from strong promoters or illegitimate recombinations, and heterochromatinised so DNA is too densely packed for recombinations to occur.  In intergenic regions, cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites are silenced.</p>
<p>Because of hypomethylation in cancer cells, there can be illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, or the activiation of cryptic promotors and the disruption of neighbouring alleles.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many genes that can be imprinted are involved in growth promotion or supression.  Alternations in DNA methylation at Imprint Control Regions (either hypo- or hyper-methylation) can results in the loss of expression of growth restricting genes and the overexpression of growth promoting genes.  In cancer, cells often display loss of imprinting - genes that should be displaying mono-allelic parent of origin specific expression (i.e. are imprinted) no longer show this, but become either expressed or silenced from both alleles.</p>
<p>With the Igf2//H19 cluster, in normal cells the imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele which prevents H19 from being expressed.  The enhancers then acts on Igf2 and this is expressed.  On the maternal allele, the Igf2 imprint control region is unmethylated, which allows CTCF to bind to it.  This in turn allows the enhancers to act on H19 and Igf2 to be silenced.</p>
<p>With hypermethylation in Wilm's tumour, the ICR is methylated on the maternal allele which leads to expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele as well as the paternal allele, which leads to a double dose of the growth promotor Igf2.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting is often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) inhibitor.  It is a nuceloside analogue that gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and it then irreversibly binds DNMT.  As cancer cells are replicating more than normal cells, they will then be affected more by this class of drug.  While previously they were used at high doses, and were toxic and non-specific, they are now used at much lower doses in the range where DNA demethylation occurs.  It is still unclear how specific the DNMTi's are.  They may hit all dividing cells, and we are unsure of the long-term consequences.  It is believed that they are effective because they target CpG island hypermethylation.  Myelodysplastic syndrome patients appear to tolerate DNMTi's well.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a stable epigenitic mark that is maintained through cell division.  It occurs on both DNA strands and is laid down by de novo methyltransferases DNMT3a and DNMT3b in mammals during replication, leading to hemi-methylated DNA.  This is the substrate for DNMT1 and the daughter DNA strands are then methylated.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming, where epigenetic marks are cleared between generations to restore totipotency, or the ability of a single cell to divide and produce all the differentiated cells in the organism. </p>
<p>There are two periods of reprogramming in mammals - early development (passive demethylation of the maternal genome when DNA methyl transferase 1 is excluded from the nucleus) and primordial germ cell development, with the differential resetting in spermatogenesis and oogenesis in mid-gestation.</p>
<p>Treating patients during these periods is inadvisable, as alterations or removal of the normal developmental process (in say assisted reproductive technologies, cloning or reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells) can result in epigenetic abnormalities, particularly aberrant imprinting.</p></div>
