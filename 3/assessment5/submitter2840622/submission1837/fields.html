    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is thought to act as a silencing epigenetic mark. The disruption to DNA methylation of CpG islands in cancer appears to be stage and cell specific but typically involves loss of imprinting, a loss of expression of growth restricting genes or the over expression of growth promoting genes. The disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease through what often is the result of one of two mechanisms: the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Disruption of normal cell methylation may also lead to genomic instability. As methylation increases at CpG islands, for example, so does the rate of metastasis. The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer by the removal of methylation (hypomethylation) of these regions and the creation of genomic instability caused by insertions (duplications), deletions, and reciprocal translocations as a result. This can be seen in the silencing of cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites causing transcriptional interference. This contributes to disease, for example, when strong promoters are influenced and have long term effects on the genome. DNA methylation at these repetitive elements is believed to protect the integrity of the genome. Without it, mutation and instability of the genome can lead to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is methylated leading to the enhanced expression of Igf2, whereas normal expression of the cluster in the maternal allele is silenced. Methylation of the paternal allele ICR blocks the transcription factor from binding and creating a barrier that stops downstream enhancers from activating IGF2 promoters. This mechanism silences the maternal allele. Hypermethylation of ICRs can lead to loss of imprinting and over-expression of Igf2 in Wilm’s tumor. IGF2 supports normal cellular growth and the loss of imprinting of IGF2 may lead to over-expression of the gene and chromatin instability and may produce tumor promoting cells via an epigenetic model of tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, also known as Dacogen and sold by Eisai, Co. Ltd, is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. The impact decitabine has on DNA methylation of the epigenome is one of hypomethylation (removal of methylation) by inhibiting methyltransferase and as an inducer of differentiation in vitro. It can have an anti-tumor effect potentially by inhibiting gene expression. Epigenetic therapy such as decitabine may provide a way to target a tumor and prevent a cancer from growing without unnecessary damage to the genome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic changes can be mitotically heritable. Humans seem to be particularly sensitive to epigenetic marks established during sensitive periods in development. A period of establishment of epigenetic marks as opposed to a period of maintenance of epigenetic marks would be considered “sensitive.” Such sensitive periods would potentially extend as far back (as being currently explored) to grandparental generations and include conditions found during both fetal/infant life, primordial germ cell development and also the “slow growth” years for boys (ages 9-12) and girls (ages 8-10). Treating patients during such periods with epigenetic drugs is likely to alter the epigenetic marks (and expression of the genome) in a manner that persists and affects an as yet undetermined succession of generations to follow. Preliminary studies would suggest more conclusions be drawn regarding epigenetic heritability and limiting its effects prior to initiating regular treatment of patients during what has come to be regarded as sensitive periods in development. </p></div>
