    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>A hallmark of cancer is aberrant DNA methylation. Methylation at CpG islands tends to increase from normal to cancerous tissues, while genome-wide DNA methylation decreases. The role of DNA methylation in cancer is context dependant—both increased and decreased methylation can be associated with specific cancers.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, CpG islands are generally unmethylated, allowing expression of genes downstream. In cancer, CpG islands and CpG island shores are hypermethlyated. This leads to repression of tumor-suppressor genes and therefore tumor growth. DNA hypermethylation is found in all tumors and is mitotically heritable—all cells in a mutated cell’s lineage inherit this hypermethylation— and thus increases with the progression of cancer. Cells with silenced tumor-suppressor genes have an advantage over other cells, dividing more rapidly and living longer, so these mutations persist.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated, which is thought to provide genomic stability by silencing repetitive elements. This stability is disrupted in cancer cells where genome-wide hypomethylation makes these regions accessible to the transcriptional machinery. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylated imprint control regions (ICRs) lead to loss of imprinting. Genes that should be expressed from one parent-of-origin specific allele are either expressed from both parental alleles or silenced from both parental alleles. Many imprinted genes are involved in growth and this loss of imprinting can lead to a double-dose of growth promoting genes, which leads to tumor formation. As an example, consider the H19/Igf2 cluster. In a normal cell, the maternal allele has an unmethylated ICR, which binds the protein CTCF. CTCF blocks downstream enhancers from activating the Igf2 gene. Instead they enhance H19. The paternal allele has a methylated ICR, which blocks binding of a protein CTCF. The DNA methylation spreads to and silences the H19 promoter. The enhancers then activate Igf2. In normal cells, Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele. But in the case of Wilm’s tumor (a childhood kidney tumor), hypermethylation of the maternal ICR leads to Igf2 expression from both parental alleles. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an anti-cancer drug that is FDA approved and available for the treatment of syndromes that can lead to leukemia. Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It works on the epigenome by becoming incorporated into the DNA and then binding DNA methyltransferases, blocking their ability to methylate DNA. The resulting unmethylated DNA is loosely packaged, with genes available for transcription. Tumor-suppressor genes can then be expressed, stopping uncontrolled cell growth. Decitabine’s action is dependant on cell division and therefore affects rapidly dividing cancer cells more than it affects normal cells, although it must have some effect on all cells. While it is most effective on leukemias, it is also being tested on solid tumors. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigentic marks are mitotically heritable—they persist in a cell lineage—but are removed between generations. This is a useful feature when using anti-cancer drugs that target the epigenetic machinery because the tumor cells that are epigenetically changed by the treatment will pass on those changes to all cells in the lineage. Even though epigenetic marks, including those affected by anti-cancer drugs, are removed between generations, there are sensitive periods of development where one could caution against the use of epigenetic drugs for fear of passing induced epigenetic changes on to the next generation. The first sensitive period that should exclude patients from treatment is during primordial germ cell development, during which all germ cells are epigenetically reset. This potentially covers a period of time from the embryo stage until a person is no longer fertile. The second sensitive period during which epigenetic drugs should possibly be avoided is just before pregnancy, during pre-implantation up to the blastocyst stage. Disrupted epigenetic reprogramming during ART and cloning and during periods of environmental stress such as famine lead to a variety of defects and infertility. Might epigenetic drugs lead to similar problems if used during developmentally sensitive periods? </p></div>
