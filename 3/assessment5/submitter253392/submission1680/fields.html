    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>The CpG Islands</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands, laid down by the methyltransferase enzymes (DNMT3a and DNMT3b in mammals) is to silence gene expression. The methylated CpG islands lead to silencing by stopping transcription factor binding. This function is disrupted in cancer by hypermethylation of CpG islands corresponding to e.g. promoters on tumour suppressor genes. Thus, the tumour suppressor genes are silenced! This can be at single islands or a whole set of islands – which results in CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP).  This contributes to disease via the silencing of the tumour suppressor genes, or promotion of oncogenes. It depends on the cell type as to how it will contribute to cancer (if at all). And note that DNA methylation it is mitotically heritable so not just one cell will be affected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The intergenic elements and repetitive elements</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity (e.g. silence cryptic promoters), whilst the normal function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is to also to maintain genomic integrity. By, e.g. preventing transposition by silencing the repeats; preventing illegitimate recombination.  This normal function is disrupted in cancer by hypomethylation. This lack (hypo) of methylation leads to genomic instability. For example, the repeats can be activated and transposed; the cryptic promoters are activated and neighbouring genes are disrupted. This genomic instability leads to the development of cancers.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster of paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated – so it’s said to be imprinted here.  On the maternal allele the imprint control region is unmethylated, and thus it’s bound by a protein called CTCF (an insulator protein). The presence of the insulator protein protects Igf2 from the downstream enhancers in this cluster. If the enhancers don’t work on Igf2 they are free to loop to H19 instead, and thus enhance H19 expression. So on the maternal allele the H19 is enhanced and the Igf2 is left alone; whilst on the paternal allele the Igf2 is acted upon by the downstream enhancers and the H19 is methylated and thus silenced (the enhancers can’t work on it).</p>
<p> In Wilm’s tumour the imprint control region is hypermethylated on the maternal allele. Thus the CTCF protein can’t bind – thus the Igf2 is no longer protected from the enhancers, and is expressed now on both the maternal and paternal alleles. The H19 is methylated on both alleles too. This contributes to tumour development through overexpression of the Igf2 growth factor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. The sensitive periods are when epigenetic reprogramming occurs; that is when the epigenetic marks are removed (demethylation). These periods are a) primordial germ cell development, and b) pre-implantation/early development. It would be inadvisable to treat patients during these two periods because in a) primordial germ cell development you would risk passing alterations between generations (from parent to offspring) via meiosis; whilst in b) early development you would risk passing alterations to all cells in the individual’s body! </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drug decitabine belongs to the class 'DNMT inhibitors' - that is, DNA methytransferase inhibitors. The impact of decitabine would be - as a DNMTi - to act as a nucleoside and thus be incorporated into the DNA. Once incorporated, these nucleoside analogues allow DNA methyltransferase enzymes to bind - but then refuse to let them go (they're bound irreversibly!).  They only work on dividing cells (like cancerous cells) as they require division to be incorporated into DNA. Their ultimate effect on DNA methylation is overall demethylation via this irreversible binding to the DNA methyltransferase enzymes. The enymes are stuck and can't work to methylate the DNA anymore! It can have an anti-tumor effect via preventing any CpG island hypermethylation, or hypermethylation of repetitive elements, or intergenic elements - which would lead to tumours via overexpression growth-factor genes for instance.</p></div>
