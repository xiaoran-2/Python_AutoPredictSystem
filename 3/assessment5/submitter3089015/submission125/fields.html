    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

<p> <span>The epigenome of cancer cells displays numerous alterations in comparison to the epigenome of their normal counterpart. Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands </span><span>. Interestingly, no global hypomethylation but rather a directed hypomethylation at satellite repeats could be detected in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors using a genome-wide approach </span></p>
<p><span>  A sensitive period is  period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals, eg. in vitro culture, in brain development, children development.</span></p>
<p><span>Trwating pacients during sensitive periods woud be inadvisible because is suceptible to enviromental signals, so there could be an interferrence</span></p></div>

<p><strong>CpG islands</strong> or <strong>CG islands</strong> (CGI) are genomic regions that contain a high frequency of <a title="CpG site" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site">CpG sites</a>. The "p" in CpG refers to the <a title="Phosphodiester bond" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphodiester_bond">phosphodiester bon</a>d between the <a title="Cytosine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine">cytosine</a> and the <a title="Guanine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine">guanine</a>, which indicates that the C and the G are next to each other in sequence, regardless of being single- or double- stranded. Between 60% and 90% of all CpGs are methylated in mammals.n many disease processes, such as <a title="Cancer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer">cancer</a>, gene promoter <a title="CpG island" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_island">CpG islands</a> acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in <a title="Transcriptional silencing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptional_silencing">transcriptional silencing</a> that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as an important component of cancer development. Hypomethylation, in general, arises earlier and is linked to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting, whereas hypermethylation is associated with promoters and can arise secondary to gene (oncogene suppressor) silencing, but might be a target for <a title="Epigenetic therapy (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epigenetic_therapy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">epigenetic therapy</a>.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements,DNA methilation covers an important function, which is metilate these, so they cant duplicate and insert in other parts of the genome, so they can not interrupt the proces of transc ription for example.In cancer this doesnt occur,  so the repetitive elements can "jump" troughout the genome.</p>
<p>This influecnces in diseaces too, because repetitive elements can cause knock out mutations, so the normal proteins cannot accomplish their mission</p>
