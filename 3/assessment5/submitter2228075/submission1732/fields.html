    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands in normal cells are unmethylated, but are hypermethlyated in cancer, leading to the silencing of important cancer-related genes; typically, these are tumor suppressor genes such as MGMT, thus leading to the abnormal growth of cancer cells.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements, as well as certain introns, of the genome in normal cells are methlyated, but are hypomethlyated in cancer. This affects transcriptional promoters, and may repress transcriptional noise, which may then lead to the possible expression of oncogenes. This also inhibits antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing, and may also cause chormosomal instability and genetic mutations, allowing for tumourigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>For the H19/Igf2 gene cluster, the paternal allele is methlyated, while the maternal allele is unmethlyated. As the maternal allele is unmethlyated, CTCF then binds to the insulator element, and the enhancers then act on H19, while Igf2 is silent. The paternal allele, which is methlyated, and CTCF doesn't bind to the insulator element, and the enhancers can act on Igf2, allowing for expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele. However, in Wilm's tumour, there is hypermethlyation of the imprint control region in the H19/Igf2 cluster, leading to overexpression of Igf2 from both the paternal and maternal allele. As Igf2 is a growth factor, this promotes abnormal cell growth and eventually may lead to tumourigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine inhibits DNA methlytransferase, and is therefore a hypomethlating agent. Decitabine acts on hypermethlated DNA to remove the methyl groups, allowing for the possible restoration of normal function to genes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation, such as tumour suppressor genes; this then causes apoptosis of abnormal cells, causing the anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methlyation states can persist through mitosis; thus, if DNA is hyper/hypomethylated via epigenetic drugs, this state is retained in the epigenome. Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic programming/reprogramming, as happens during pregnancy in the foetus, and in younger, pre- and pubescent people who still have developing germ cells. Treating patients during sensitive periods would do a lot of damage to the normal epigenetic programming their cells are undergoing, causing unintentional hypo- or hypermethlyation.</p></div>
