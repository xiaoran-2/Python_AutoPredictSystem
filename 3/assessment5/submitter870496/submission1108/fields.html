    <h1>Submission 1108 from Anon (session_user_id: 991617b7b8be0f3d5b878d901750c9477b33db69)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents class (hypomethylating agent) of epigenetic inhibitors and it is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. The drug hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting specifically DNA methyltransferases. Decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands with it only 30 minute half-life.  Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect because of the epigenetic character of the myelodysplastic syndromes. This is because the epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. The assumption is that once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be used for epigenetic therapies, which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Although DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent cell generations, reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during gametogenesis and after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. Decitabine can have an antitumour effect as the epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells. The assumption is that once erased, though, they never return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes, which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. However, concern exists because of the sensitive periods - epigenetic reprograming occurs like sperm and eggs formation. Treating patients during such periods would be inadvisable because of need of the reprograming phenomenon that has to occur that would be more destructive than helpful. Moreover, different tumors have different dependencies therefore this has further implications of effectiveness of epigenetic therapies in tumors with these dependencies. Further, effects of DNA methylation depletion can be stage specific. Meaning when we use drugs we should know when is the best time to inhibit DNA methylation. This will need to be addressed in every type of tumor in every age of the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-value"><p>Both hypomethylation genome-wide and tumor suppressor hypermethylation contribute to DNA methylation in cancer, however the driving role of DNA methylation is context-dependent. DNA methylation is altered in cancer via CpG regions, intergenic spacers or repetitive elements but also by disruption of imprint control regions (ICRs). <br />Most of the genome constitutes intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In cancer these regions tend to be hypomethylated. The high level of hypomethylation of the intergenic regions, repetitive elements, and CpG or imprint control regions results in high tumor chances. Normally, the high hypermethylation of the CpG means genes to be less likely to be expressed. Hypomethylation at CpG island shores correlates even better with cancer probability then CpG islands itself. Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence genes close to them (often silence the promoters of tumor genes). Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. CpG island are more likely to be disrupted by methylated  (hypermethylation) in cancer while in ordinary cells are not methylated at all. According to Knudson hypothesis cancer is the results of the multiple, accumulative hits of epigenetic distortion on DNA. Cancer cells take over, as the promoters of oncogenes are not silenced and those cells growth much faster than ordinary cells. In normal cells also intragenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated which is not the case for cancer cells (hypomethylation). This phenomenon is called reciprocal swap. To maintain genetically stability, those are silenced.  Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and especially in repetitive elements contributes to the disease by illegitimate, reciprocal recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, and example can be the one of the H19/Igf2 cluster caused by hypemethylation of ICR.  In ordinary cells, this cluster is under imprinting control. The imprint control region is methylated on paternal allele and it is un-methylated on maternal allele, causing on the maternal allele the CTCF binding to the control region only. In the maternal allele, the enhancers will act on H19 that is down-streams from the control regions causing silencing of Igf2 on the maternal allele. However, on the parental allele enhancers can act on Igf2 because control region is methylated. Igf2 undergoes expression because CTCF does not bind to the imprint control region. Loss of imprinting can cause both silencing of parental alleles or expressed. Lot of genes that are imprinted are involved in growth, both promoting or suppressing it. In the Wiliam´s tumor the both imprint control region are methylated so CTCF can not bind and Igf2 on both maternal and parental allele are expressed. In such way individual receives the double dosage of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoting gene, related to kidney tumor.</p></div>
