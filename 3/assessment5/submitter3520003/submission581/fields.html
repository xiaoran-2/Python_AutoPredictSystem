    <h1>Submission 581 from Anon (session_user_id: 9082c79152f80ad0882db4b99e103fe7c7835819)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. Its effect on the DNA is to inhibit DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs).</li>
<li>The de-methylating effect of Decitabine would preferentially affect the CpG islands, as these are preferentially methylated in cancerous cells. <br />Since the other DNA sites such as intergenic and repetitive elements are de-methylated in cancerous cells, Decitabine would have no effect on them.</li>
<li>Once demethylated, the genes near to the CpG islands will be able to express again. As these are tumor suppressing genes, the cell’s normal regulatory machinery would be able to restart. The “restarting” functions include cell proliferation, cell differentiation and apoptosis. This means that the cell will regain its ability to halt any further tumour growth (hence, its anti-tumor effects). <br />Since the epigenetic changes brought about by the Decitabine are inheritable, the changes are passed onto the daughter and granddaughter cells.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancerous cells, the DNA methylation changes can be described as a reversal to that in healthy normal cells. In other words, sites that are normally methylated are demethylated and sites that are normally not methylated are now methylated. Specifically, these changes can be summarised as (based on the points in the question):</p>
<ol><li>CpG islands are not methylated in healthy cells. (This makes them less susceptible to mutational pressure.) CpG islands are kept methylation-free so that the nearby genes can express themselves clear of any obstructions.</li>
<li>In cancerous cells, some CpG islands are methylated. Cancers that are typified by methylated CpG islands include colorectal cancer, gliomas and neuroblastoma. Hypermethylation of the CpG islands increases with tumorigenicity.</li>
<li>In cancerous cells, the CpG islands near to tumor suppressing genes are methylated and these genes are consequently silenced. Once these genes are silenced, tumors can form. </li>
<li>Intergenic and repetitive elements in normal DNA are normally methylated. The methylated elements allow for stability in the genome by keeping the silenced genes tightly wound as heterochromatin.</li>
<li>In cancerous cells, the intergenic and repetitive elements have lost their methyl groups. This hypomethylation (loss of methyl groups) occurs to some degree in all tumour types tested and progresses with tumorigenicity.</li>
<li>The loss of methyl groups in in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability. The genomic instability is a result of the opening of the chromatin (to euchromatin), which in-turn facilitates the following tumorigenetic changes: illegitimate recombination between repeats, an activation of repeats and transposition and the activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Depending on the changes to the DNA, tumors can develop in certain tissues, for example by promoting oncogenes.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The hypermethylation of the ICR, or the loss of imprinting, at the H19/Igf2 cluster causes an increase in the expression of Igf2 (Insulin-like growth factor 2). The increase in the concentration of Igf2 leads to the condition known as Wilm’s tumour. The mechanism:</p>
<ol><li>On the paternal chromosome, the ICR site and the H19 gene are methylated. Hence, no CTCF binding takes place at the ICR site and the H19 expression is silenced. The absence of CTCF allows enhancers to access the Igf2 gene and promote Igf2 expression.</li>
<li>The ICR and the H19 gene on the healthy maternal chromosome are un-methylated. Hence, the CTCF protein attaches at the ICR site and blocks the enhancers from reaching the Igf2 gene, instead the enhancers act on the H19 gene. </li>
<li>In the disrupted case, the maternal H19 gene and the ICR site are methylated: the H19 gene is silenced and the CTCF protein is unable to bind to the ICR site. Hence, the enhancers can reach the maternal Igf2 gene and cause it to express. Since the paternal Igf2 continues to express Igf2 as usual, a double dose of Igf2 is expressed.</li>
<li>The increase Igf2 concentration causes abnormal growth in the kidney tissue in young children. This abnormal growth, term pre-neoplastic growth, occurs early and indicates an eventual tumour.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<ol><li>Using epigenetic drugs to alter the DNA methylation in tumour cells has enduring effects on the epigenome beyond the period of the drug treatment because the changes made to the tumour cells are passed onto the daughter and granddaughter cells; i.e., mitotically heritable.</li>
<li>The epigenetic drugs should not be administered during sensitive periods. A sensitive period is when the epigenetic marks are being reprogrammed; i.e., during clearing and resetting of the epigenetic marks.</li>
<li>The two sensitive periods (during human development) are (i) during pre-implantation development of the embryo and (ii) during germ cell development. The first period is during implantation and affects woman that are either pregnant or attempting to get pregnant. The second period is during the first 10 years for females and for men trying to father a child (the drugs influence the epigenetic information contained in their eggs/sperm/gametes).  </li>
<li>Treating patients during the sensitive periods is inadvisable because the setting of epigenetic marks by the cells can be disrupted with these drugs, leading to incorrectly placed marks and resulting in the abnormal development of the somatic cells (therefore altering the phenotype). In short, the disrupted epigenetic marks are passed on to successive cell generations and will affect the development and viability of the embryo/fetus.</li>
