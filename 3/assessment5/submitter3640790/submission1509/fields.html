    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually close to promoter regions that allow transcription machinery to bind to produce genes so CpG islands are typically kept free of DNA methylation.</p>
<p>In cancer, the low DNA methylation of some of the CpG islands, becomes <strong>hypermethylated</strong> as the normal tissue becomes hyperplastic, then neoplastic, and is greatest where the tumour undergoes metastasis. In cancer this increase in CpG island methylation occurs in contrast to the global 5mC DNA, the more common intergenic regions and repetitive elements and even in the introns of genes which generally become <strong>hypomethylated</strong>. So in cancer there's an inversion - a swap - of where the DNA methylation is found. </p>
<p>Typically the CpG island hypermethylation is found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. This can happen genetically or epigenetically to silence the tumour suppressor genes. And as the DNA is mitotically heritable, locking in the silent, inactive state is a very effective way for the cancer cells to gain a competitive advantage over normal cells in the surrounding tissues so they can resist dying and divide more rapidly. For tumorigenesis, The Knudson hypothesis maintains that multiple 'hits' are necessary so more than one tumor suppressor gene has to be silenced, and perhaps an oncogene activated so CpG island hypermethylation can be one of these Knudson hits. Importantly, the tumour suppressor genes silencing is specific to each different tumour subtype.</p>
<p>In different diseases CpG island hypermethylation of tumour suppressors has been found in the <em>RB</em> gene in retinoblastoma, <em>MLH1</em> in transgenerational colorectal cancer both genetically or hypermethylated epigenetically, similarly in<em> BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> in breast cancer and <em>MGMT</em> in gliomas and colorectal tumours can be mutated or hypermethylated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the imprinted <strong>paternal</strong> allele DNA methylation at the imprint control region (ICR) blocks binding of the CTFC insulator protein that insulates the <em>Igf2</em> so DNA methylation spreads to the long noncoding RNA H19 promotor to silence it allowing the downstream enhancers to access and activate <em>Igf2</em>. The H19 promoter is no longer active on the paternal allele due to through heterochromatin DNA methylation spreading downstream from the ICR.</p>
<p>Through chromatin looping In the <strong>maternal</strong> allele <em>Igf2</em> is silenced due to CTFC binding to the demethylated ICR and blocking the primary action of the enhancers to activate <em>Igf2</em>, allowing the enhancers to activate the H19 promoter which is close upstream.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, like Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, 2 copies of the chromosome from the paternal allele (and none from the maternal allele) on chromosome 11 activate an overexpression of<em> Igf2</em> that can express an oncogene.</p>
<p>Uniparental disomy either maternal or paternal, or gene mutations can cause loss of <em>Cdkn1</em> or overdose of <em>Igf2</em> and/or other genes can cause fetal and post-natal overgrowth, macroglossia, predisposition to embryonic or childhood tumours such as Wilm's tumour in kidneys. Affected offspring can only come from the mother.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic inhibitor Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, is a DNA-demethylating agent, and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p>As a DNA demethylating agent Decitabine slows tumour growth by reducing the silencing of the tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer - and without affecting normal cells nearby. Complex DAC-induced DNA methylation changes occur very early and imply mechanisms distinct from non-hypomethylating cytosine analogs.</p>
<p>DNA-demethylating agents like Decitabene can alter the tumour cells in some lasting way that makes them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome as the epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable in somatic cells and once changed through drug treatment typically remain unchanged from daughter to grandmother cells and beyond.</p>
<p>The 2 main sensitive periods in cell development are during paternal and maternal demethylation periods to erase and re-establish epigenetic marks. The first is in pre-implementation pre-placenta development at the blastocyst stage when methylation is lowest to erase the highly specific marks that egg and sperm germ cells have for their specific roles and the second phase is during primordial germ cell development when the somatic marks are removed and specific sperm and egg chromatin epigenetic signatures are laid down. External psychological, environmental, aural and chemical influences can alter epigenetic reprogramming during sensitive periods.</p>
<p>Treating patients during PGC and GC development can disrupt the egg or sperm epigenetic reprogramming during their period of maturity. Treating patients in early development - say ICSI/IVF, culture in vitro or embryo handling can also disrupt epigenetic reprogramming. In early development there may also be an erosion of the DNA methylation imprints during thew culture period, perhaps caused by the maternal effect proteins that protect the ICR regions being misexpressed.</p></div>
