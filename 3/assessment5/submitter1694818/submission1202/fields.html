    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At CpG islands, DNA methylation's normal function is to silence the expression of a nearby gene, but in general CpG islands are not heavily methylated.  In cancer cells, CpG islands that control the expression of tumour suppressor genes will be methylated more often and more completely than in normal cells.  This disruption of normal DNA methylation will reduce or eliminated the expression of these genes, which will in turn reduce their anti-tumour effect, enabling the cancer to more easily grow.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated to suppress the activity of their DNA, and to reduce the genomic instability produced by repetitive elements.  In cancer cells, these regions are less methylated than in normal cells.  This disruption of normal DNA methylation will permit these regions to become more active.  Intergenic regions may contain normally-inactive "cryptic" promoters for nearby genes, and the demethylation of these regions will activate these promoters, thus activating expression of the genes.  When repetitive elements are demethylated, they cause genomic instability by allowing aberrant recombinations (deletions, reciprocal translocations, and insertions), which can in turn disrupt normal cell operation by breaking genes, creating additional copies of them, enabling or blocking gene promoters, and enabling or disrupting elements that disable gene expression, as in the H19/Igf2 region.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is an imprinted group of genes.  The Imprint Control Region for this cluster is normally methylated on the paternal allele.  This methylation prevents CTCF from binding to the ICR.  Because the CTCF protein does not bind to the ICR, a group of downstream enhancers can reach the Igf2 gene's locus, enabling its expression.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, this cluster's ICR is normally demethylated.  This enables CTCF to bind to the ICR, which in turn prevents the downstream enhancers from reaching the Igf2 gene's locus, effectively silencing that gene.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, there is abnormal hypermethylation of the H19/Igf2 ICR on the maternal allele, while the paternal allele is not changed.  This loss causes the maternal Igf2 gene to be expressed in exactly the same way as it is on the paternal allele.  This overexpression of Igf2, a growth factor, is directly linked to the cancerous development of affected cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor.  Its function is to decrease the hypermethylation that occurs in CpG islands in tumour cells.  It binds to the methylated DNA, and captures the DNMT when it comes to copy methylation to a new DNA strand during cell division.  The new strand will be significantly less methylated.</p>
<p>Removing this hypermethylation reverses one of the fundamental epigenetic changes found in tumour cells, allowing tumour-suppressing genes to become active once more.  This in turn has the expected effect of reducing or even reversing the growth of the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors are the primary drugs that alter the methylation in cells.  Their effect will last beyond the period of drug treatment because the methylation state of a DNA strand is mitotically heritable, so the reduced state will be inherited during subsequent cell divisions.</p>
<p>Certain periods of development, called sensitive periods, should be avoided when treating patients.  A sensitive period is a period when alterations in the biochemical environment will have more critical effects on the epigenome.  During a sensitive period, the epigenome is being reprogrammed, and inhibiting DNMT operation will interfere with this reprogramming.</p>
<p>There are two main sensitive periods for the body as a whole.  Both of them are very early during embryonic development.  The first is when the whole epigenome is demethylated just prior to being remethylated during cell differentiation, affecting the embryo itself.  The second is when the primordial germ cells are forming, and a similar reprogramming occurs, and this affects the embryo's future children.  In essence, both of these sensitive periods are risky for the recently-conceived embryo, but require care when treating the mother-to-be.</p></div>
