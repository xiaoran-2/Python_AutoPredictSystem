    <div class="field-value"><p title="Tissue (biology)">CpG island methylation plays an important role in epigenetic gene control during mammalian development and is frequently altered in disease situations such as cancer. The majority of CpG islands is normally unmethylated, but a sizeable fraction is prone to become methylated in various cell types and pathological situations.</p>
<p title="CpG island">Epigenetic alterations are as important in a cell’s transformation to cancer due to many mutations.Mechanisms of epigenetic silencing of tumor supressor genes and activation of oncogenes results  alteration in DNA methylation of CpG islands, histone modifications, and dysregulation of DNA binding proteins.</p>
<p class="mw-redirect" title="Transcriptional silencing">Unmethylated CpGs are often grouped in clusters called CpG islands, that are present in the 5' regulatory regions of many genes. In many disease processes, gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation ( or sometimes hypomethylation), which results in transcriptional silencing  that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division that can progress to a malfunctioning state.</p>
<p class="mw-redirect" title="Transcriptional silencing">DNA demethylation that occurs in primordial germ cells (PGCs) and in early embryos, is essential for cells to return to a pluripotent state. especially within introns, intergenic regions and repeats. They retain high levels of methylation that helps in the regulation of gene expression during development as well as successful germline development.</p>
<p class="mw-redirect" title="Transcriptional silencing">DNA methylation in human cancer cells are hypomethylated. Consequently, transposable elements may become active and contribute to the genomic instability. Simultaneously, cancer cells exhibit hypermethylation within the promoter regions of many CpG island-associated tumor suppressor genes sees transcriptionally silenced state resulting in a loss-of-function. Thus, through the effects of both hypo- and hyper-methylation, DNA methylation significantly affects the genomic landscape of cancer cells.</p>
<p class="mw-redirect" title="Transcriptional silencing"><span style="color:#808080;"> Both losses and gains of DNA methylation are observed to contribute pathophysiologically by inactivating tumor suppressor genes, inducing chromosomal instability and ectopically activating gene expression.Aberrant DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements provides intrinsic gene susceptibility and alters gene function during this process.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Maternal and paternal gene imprints, lay the foundation for normal embryonic development and differentiation. Many of the proteins involved in the imprinting process are then turned off, but some are erroneously turned back on in precancerous cells. This error leads to loss of function of some genes and improper imprinting, a term called hypermethylation of other genes, some of which are tumor suppressors.</p>
<p>The epigenome serves to distinguish between the two copies of an imprinted gene. Eg: only the father's copy of a gene called <em>IGF2</em> is able to make its protein. That is because marks in the epigenome keep the mother's <em>IGF2</em> copy switched off in every cell of the body.</p>
<p>The <em>H19</em>/<em>IGF2</em> locus are connected and are expressed in a mutually exclusive manner  that plays multiple roles in gene regulation. On the maternal allele, the <em>IFG2</em> promoters silences gene expression. In contrast, <em>H19</em> does not bind to the methylated paternally inherited chromosome. </p>
<p title="WT1">In Wilms' tumors, there is an abnormal bipaternal pattern of expression at three imprinted loci, H19, IGF2 and KIP2, clustered on chromosome 11p15.5. </p>
<p title="WT1">Here, 2G7 RNA is spliced and polyadenylated but lacks long ORFS. Genomic imprinting is disrupted and 2G7 and TNNT3 are biallelically expressed in mid-fetal and adult human tissues and 2G7 shows persistent expression in these cases.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine) is a cytosine analogue modified in position 5 of the pyrimidine ring. Decitabine is a class of medications called hypomethylation agents that decreases the rate of methylation patterns. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), which are diseases of the bone marrow. </p>
<p>Hypomethylating agents, such as decitabine decreases total 5-methylcytosine content and reactivates imprinted genes causing hypomethylation in all types of cancer samples. But, the patterns of methylation and gene expression across the samples are determined by the intrinsic properties of the primary cells, rather than DAC treatment.</p>
<p>Decitabine produces its anticancer effects by causing a chemical reaction that damages the DNA in a cell. The DNA damage caused by decitabine inhibits protein synthesis and results in cellular death. Epigenetic evidence suggests that DAC induces CD80 expression via demethylation of CpG dinucleotide sites in the promoter of CD80 gene in a variety of human cancer cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Stephen Baylin have shown that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer.</p>
<p>This can be assisted with the use of hypomethylating agents like DAC that erases the abnormal methylations and prove an effective chemotherapeutic agents. Once erased, though, they do not return. Unlike other forms of gene regulation, epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a state in the development of children to acquire certain abilities, such as language, discrimination of sensory stimuli, and mental modeling of the environment. The development of the brain is sensitive enough to absorb the information.</p>
<p>There are many steps of sensitive periods during development. They are- Birth to 6 years, 1.5 to 3 years, 1.5 to 4 years, 2 to 4 years, 2.5 to 6 years, 3 to 6 years, 4 to 5 years and 4.5 to 6 years.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because their brain is quite susceptible to epigenetic changes by environments and this can have irreversible and permanent epigenetic modifications in those patients. </p></div>
