    <div class="field-value"><p>Altered the expression patron in a normal cells can promote cancer, epigentic marks are sensitive to enviroment signals. One of this epigenetic marks are DNA methylation that particpate in the regulation of process  like  imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation and expresion of tumor supressors genes. In cancer, there are many genes hypermethylated, specially tumor supressors, and with the progress of the cancer the methylation rate increased on these, given a poor prognosis.CpG hypermethylation of promoters not only affects the expression of protein coding genes but also the expression of various noncoding RNAs, some of which have a role in malignant transformatio. But, also hypomethylation can affect the regulation of genes in the intergenic regions or repetitive elements principally by inducing genomic instability, making that some of these genes that normally are expressed now are silenced and viceversa. Because in normal cells these regions are in a heterochromatin state, but in cancer has a more relax conformation allowing modifications like deletions, insertion, increased mutation rates that leads to the cells have a phatway signals altered and wrong instructions for a correct development promoting the overexpression of genes like oncogens or some that participate in cell growth. Mutations in DNA methyltransferases to contribute to developmental abnormalities. All of this contribuite to have an erroneous pattern expression, lost its regulation and contribute the development of many illness.<span> <span> </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes restrict the expression of a specific genes, so any changed in the methylation state can produced misregulation in the expression of this genes having overexpression of them, for example in oncogenes, growth promoting genes or silenced other that normally are expressed. In the case of H19/Igf2 cluster the maternal allele express H19 because CTCF binding to the ICR that are not methylated, whereas paternal allel has methylated ICR blocking CTCF binding allowing the enhacers activate Igf2. So, in Wilm's tumor the ICR are methylated in both allels (paternal and also maaternal) promoting the overexpression of Igf2 that is a growth promoting gene so, this contribute to the development of the tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer one of the epigenetic alterations is that DNA methylation increase in many genes involved in cell cycle, cell growth, etc. The tumor supressors genes that in normal cells are active  in cancer cells are inactive because their hypermethylation. Is known that this hypermethylation increase with tumorigenicity. Decitabine is a de-methylate agent because inhibits the action of DNA methyltransferases, so it will reduce the hypermetylation effect in cancer cells and prevents tumor development. But it could have a global effect that it has to be consider the risk against the benefits.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>High dosis of drugs produced citotoxicity, buy low dosis have a prolongate effect (use in the study), and it seems that they have a preference for the self renew (stem-like) and tumorigenic cells. This cells have a high rate of divisions that is necesary to incorporated the drug into genomic DNA, and in each division modified the methylated state, and this is heritable to the next daugther cell, so the consecuence is stop tumor growth. Because in a sensitive period (early development and germ cell formation) the epigenetic marks are erased (and is suceptible to enviroment signals) is not a good moment to apply the drug, due to the mark can be lost or the reprogramming processs can be altered and produce nocive effects.<br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-fb61dbd7c94c4cbff1960862/970238/asst-5/970238-5212fdaeb86f20.50813800.htm">Combination Epigenetic Therapy Has Efficacy in Patients with Refractory Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer.htm</a><br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-fb61dbd7c94c4cbff1960862/970238/asst-5/970238-5212fdd730b365.64774683.htm">Transient Low Doses of DNA Demethylating Agents Exert Durable Anti-tumor Effects on Hematological and Epithelial Tumor Cells.htm</a></p></div>
