    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the bases for epigenetic controls such as imprinting and X chromosome inactivation. Methylation of DNA occures at cytosine residues of cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) of DNA, and it usually causes depression of gene transcription. There are some regions which are called CpG islands where CpGs are contained in high frequency. CpG islands are often located around promoters , and methylated promoters cause silences of the related gene transcription. In normal cells, CpG islands of promoters<em> </em>are not methylated, independent of their activity state of related genes<em>.</em> On the other hand, CpG islands of promoters in cancer cells are often hypermethylated, and it inhibits the gene expression of tumor suppressor genes. It causes the aberrant growth of cancer cells. The hypermethylation of CpG islands is thought to cause some diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The hypomethylation of CpG islands also reported to cause some diseases like multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>DNA methylations are also found in intergenic regions and repetitive regions. These methylations contribute for genes stability. Because, these regions are often repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats come from recombination or remnants of retroviral insertions, and expression of these regions may causes instability of other important genes. Therefore the function of these methylations is speculated to repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, prevent transposition of repeats, avoid illegitimate recombination, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and so on. In cancer cells, these methylations are often disrupted, tend to be demethylated. Also in some diseases cells, hypomethylation or hypermethylation in these regions have detected.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>H19/lgf2 </em>cluster is controlled by imprinting. This cluster consists of <em>lgf2</em>, imprinting control region (ICR), <em>H19</em> and enhancers for <em>lgf2</em>. ICR and the promoter of <em>H19</em> of paternal allele are methylated, though these sites of maternal allele are not methylated. CTCF, an insulator protein, binds to ICR of maternal allele. This binding inhibit the acativity of the enhancers to <em>lgf2</em>. On the other, methylation of ICR of paternal allele blocks binding of CTCF, and the enhancers can effect to <em>lgf2</em>. In contrast, expression of <em>H19</em>, a non-coding long RNA, is blocked by DNA methylation in paternal allele, while it is not in maternal allele. The gene <em>lgf2 </em>is known as an oncogene, the function of <em>H19</em> is not known well.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting at the <em>H19/lgf2</em> cluster is observed in Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome. In this disease, over expression of <em>lgf2</em> is confirmed, in linked to disruption of the upstream region, <em>Kcnq1</em> cluster. Large tongue and predisposition of embryonic/childhood tumors are observed in this syndrome. It is assumed to be caused by over expression of the oncogene, <em>lgf2</em>, and promorting genes, which are induced by the disruption of epigenetic imprinting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA demethylating medical agents, and is used for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. This agent is cytosine analogue and depresses DNA methylation by inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. In tumor cells, hypermethylation of CpG islands blocks expressing tumor suppressor genes. This medical agent is supporsed to makes it possible to express tumor suppressor genes by demethylation of CpG islands. There is a possibility that normal cells are also affected. However, growth rate of tumor cell is much faster than that of normal cell, the side effect may be light. Decitabine is one of the 2 sorts of epigenetic drugs which have been sold on the market.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is inherited to daughter cells after duplicate. If once altering methylation is occurred, it will be able to have enduring effects on the epigenome. Therefore the agents inhibiting DNA methyltransferase is expected to become drugs with long term effect against some cancers. On the other hand, these agents have a possibility to give serious effects for normal cells, too. During development, the most sensitive period is early development stage (pre-implantation period), and primordial germ cell development stage. If altering methylation agents is administered in these periods, disruption of gene control arises in normal cells. Therefore, treatment with these agents can't be used for the patients who are pregnant and who have a plan to make a baby in the near future. And these agents should not be recommended to use for young patients, especially for the patient who do not finish the secondary sex characteristic. Because cell duplicate of young people is active and imprinting may be continued until the secondary sex characteristic.</p></div>
