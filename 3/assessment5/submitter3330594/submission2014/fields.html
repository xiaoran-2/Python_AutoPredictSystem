    <div class="field-value"><p>There are two prominent patterns seen in the cancer epigenome; DNA hypermethylation of CPG Islands, and DNA hypomethylation genome wide. CpG Islands, promoters with a high density of CpG dinucleotides, are normally unmethylated regardless of their functional state. In cancer, these distinct promoters show hypermethylation, silencing underlying genes including underlying tumor suppressor genes. Thereby, this aberrant hypermethylation turns off transcription of the proteins/gene products that repressively regulate cell-cycle; proteins that normally inhibit cell division and cause apoptosis when things awry. By eliminating the 'brake pedals' in this way, cancer allows the cell cycle to accelerate attenuated, resulting in rapid cell growth and replication. The result of this uninhibited activity is the tumorous tissue (hyperplastic) and the overload of tissues products that cause the cancer disease state. As methylation of CpG Islands increases, tumorogenicity also increases from neoplasm to metastasis.</p>
<p>The cancer-type hypomethylation seen in the rest of the genome (genome-wide) includes hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements (repeats). Intergenic regions and repeats are methylated in the normal, disease-free genome. Methylation at these regions allows cells to stay genomically stable. This is because methylation prevents repeats and other intergenic elements on one DNA strand or chromosome from mixing/interacting with very similar/identical nucleotide sequences on a nearby DNA strand or chromosome. A reduction in this type of methylation, as seen in the cancer epigenome, would clearly increase the chances of genomic mutations in all varieties; insertions, transpositions, deletions, etc.   Genetic mutations have been known for some time to cause cancer by creating any number of cellular mis-expressions (e.g. aberrant promotions, removal of coding transcripts, abnormal protein products, etc.). Studies have shown that as genome-wide methylation decreases, tumorogenicity increases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer's possible alterations to the genome's imprint control regions (ICRs) can be particularly disruptive. A loss of the normal monoallelic imprinting by either aberrant hypermethylation or hypomethylation can cause cell mis-expression of the underlying genes and an associated disease state. In the case of Wilm's tumor, an early childhood nephroblastoma, there is a loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 gene cluster’s ICR. The maternal allele's differentially methylated region (DMR) is normally insulated from methylation and expresses the ncRNA H19 gene product. The paternal allele is normally methylated at the DMR, and spreads methylation to the H19 promoter silencing the H19 gene. H19 silencing allows paternal allele enhancers to then access the Igf2 gene activating its expression. The loss of imprinting at the maternal allele, caused by hypermethylation of the maternal DMR, silences the H19 gene, and allows the enhancers to access the Igf2 gene in the same way they do in the paternal allele. The Igf2 gene product is an insulin-like growth factor. Thus, the aberrant cell will be translating a double dosage of Igf2, causing unmitigated cell growth, replication, and the cancer disease state.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, thus has a hypomethylating effect on DNA. Inhibiting DNA methyltransferase should remove the aberrant CpG Island methylation in daughter cells when the cell is replicated.  Daughter cells would thus be unmethylated at CpG Island sites, free from the silencing of the tumor suppressor genes that were being methyly-choked in their parent cells. These tumor suppressor genes and their gene products would then be able to put the brakes on cell replication/proliferation and stop the tumor from growing and/or spreading. Tumor-suppressor gene products may also induce cell apoptosis in remaining aberrant cells. Since methylation is a mitotically heritable trait, ‘lack of methylation' is also heritable. Therefore, when treatment with Decitabine ends and DNA methyltransferase activity is restored, all cells affected by the treatment should remain demethylated at the treated sites, as well as should be their cellular progeny.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Most of the epigenome is programmed during early embryonic development, before cells start differentiating into their respective tissues. These epigenetic marks, e.g. DNA methylation, are necessarily mitotically heritable. Drugs that alter these epigenetic marks will have a lasting effect post-treatment, because all cells affected by the drug will pass down their drug-induced epigenetic changes to their daughter cells. Although this characteristic is beneficial for treatment of cancer, it is a cause of concern for non-cancerous cells. It is of particular concern to cells undergoing normal epigenetic reprogramming: going through sensitive periods. There are two sensitive periods in humans; gametogenesis and early embryonic development.  The epigenome is most easily altered by the environment during these sensitive periods, when epigenetic marks are being systematically erased and laid down. Treating patients with an epigenome-altering drug during or near these sensitive periods would be ill-advised, as the drug may affect the normal epigenetic programming process of the developing gametes or fetus in a detrimental, or even deadly, way. Women being treated with an epigenetic drug should avoid pregnancy during treatment and for at least 1 month after treatment, and at least 2 months after treatment for men.</p></div>
