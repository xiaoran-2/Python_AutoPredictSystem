    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is silencing of gene expression since CpGs often occur at promoter regions. The hyper-methylation of CpG islands lead to alteration in transcription leading to aberrant gene expression. Moreover, methylated Cytosine nucleotide is prone to deamination to give rise to Thymine, resulting in mutation which leads to cancer. The CpG islands in promoter regions are usually unmethylated, and when there's a disruption in methylation, it leads to an imbalance in the gene expression/protein production, i.e, diseased condition.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to prevent mutagenic transposition and silence the repeats. In cancer, there is a decrease in methylation of intergenic regions which leads to genomic instability. Also, there is a decrease in methylation of repetitive regions resulting in failure to avoid trancriptional interference. The decrease in methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to diseases by increasing the frequency of interference in transcription by repeats and also occurance of many mutations as a result of hapazard transposon insertion.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In paternal allele, there's methylation of the ICR block (where the repressor protein CTCF binds), and the methylation spreads over to H19 promoter silencing it. Hence, the enhancer can access Igf2 and activate it. Whereas in maternal allele, the ICR block is bound by CTCF repressor protein which blocks the activity of the enhancer, hence the Igf2 protein is not expressed.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumor is the result of bipaternal epigenotype resulting in both alleles having  inactive H19 and active Igf2. In this condition, both paternal and maternal alleles are methylated at H19 promoter rendering it inactive, and the enhancer is able to access Igf2, activating it. </p>
<p>Igf2 expression occurs only through paternal allele during embryonic development. When the imprinting on this gene is disrupted, there is either over or under expression of the growth factor which might intensify some of the diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It blocks the activity of DNA methyltransferase, hence eliminating DNA methylation in neoplastic cells whereby certain tumor suppressor genes are activated or some growth pathways are inhibited. The result is reduction in tumor cells. The anti-tumor effect of this drugs comes from the activation of tumor suppressor genes in the neoplastic cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, hence by altering DNA methylation using epigenetic drugs, the epigenetic is passed on to all the daughter cells that are going to be derived from the treated cells indefinitely. Hence, the process can have enduring effects on the epigenome. One would avoide treating patients with epigenetic drugs during the sensitive period. A sensitive period is when there is epigenetic reprogramming occurring, namely early development of embryo and Germ cell development. Treating patients during senstive periods would be inadvisable because during these periods of active epigenetic reprogramming, any external chemical or environmental stress can significantly alter the epigenetic marks. This results in many diseases, abnomalities, as well as cancer.</p></div>
