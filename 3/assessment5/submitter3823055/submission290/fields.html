    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a process that occurs in the cell and it's based in adding a methyl group to the C5' of cytosine. This process occurs principaly at the<strong> CpG islands</strong> and is laid down by the novo DNA-methyltransferases DNMT3a and DNMT3b during the DNA replication. In each cell division, the daughter cells have one strand of their DNA methylated and not the other (the new one). The hemi-methylated DNA is the substrat for DNMT1 which mantains the methylation. A CpG island is a fragment of the DNA that is formed by Citosynes and Guanines bind by a phosphate group. This groups apears at the promoters and are usually unmethylated. If a CpG island is methylated the silencing of the gene expression ocurrs because this state promotes the condensed chromatine (thanks to MCP proteins).</p>
<p>In neoplastic cells or cancer cells we find hypomethylation of heterochromatin that produces genomic instability and increased mitotic recombination events. In addition, there are  <strong>hypermethylation of CpG islands</strong> of constitutive genes and tumor suppressor genes: this means that the transcription of the genes that participate in suppressing the cancer cells is "inactivated" because the CGI is very methylated and the transcriptional machinery can't work in this gene. It influences the cancer because <strong>tumour suppressor genes are silenced</strong>. It's a sign that we've observed in cancer cells (at CGI, CGI shores and in the CIMP). Furthermore, this epigenetic mark is inheritable and rapidly selected.</p>
<p>However, the <strong>intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong> are usually methylated, because it maintains the genomic stability and protects the genome from transposable elements. In cancer this fragments of DNA are <strong>hypomethylated</strong> (maybe because the Dnmt1 isn't in) and DNA <strong>doesn't mantain its integrity</strong> so the ilegitimate recombination and the activation of repeats, cryptic promoters and transposition elements occur.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DIgf2 and H19 are a cluster that forms an imprinting control regiont. Their regulation is very similar, but reciprocal. </p>
<p>In the <strong>paternal allele</strong> the DNA methylation is focused on H19 and its promoter, which is silenced. In addition, the methylation doesn’t allow the binding in this site of an insulator protein (CTCF). This fact, allows the enhancers to act on Igf2 and activate Igf2. This implies that the binding CTCF+promoter of H19 called DMD is sensible to methylation so CTCF can’t bind and doesn’t act like an insulator protein and thus the paternal allele of Igf2 is expressed. In consequence, H19 is a gene whose expression is exclusively maternal, because in the paternal allele it is methylated. </p>
<p>In the <strong>maternal allele</strong> there isn’t methylation in the promoter, so CTCF can bind to this region of DNA. CTCF impedes that enhancers activate Igf2. However, in this case, H19 is able to be transcribed.</p>
<p>On <strong>Wilm’s tumour </strong>the methylation on H19-promoter in the maternal allele occurs, so H19 won’t transcribe. The maternal allele is like the paternal allele right now, because the Igf2 is activated in both.  Loss of imprinting of IGF2 is linked to reduced expression and abnormal methylation of H19 in Wilms' tumor.<br />This causes <strong>increased cell growth</strong>.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <strong>hypomethylating agent</strong>. <br />If genes (as tumour-suppressor-genes) are <span>excessively </span>methylated they can't be transcribed, so they are silencing and not expressed.</p>
<p>Decitabine is able to <strong>reduce the DNA methylation</strong>. Inside the cell, the drug turns on, because its activation is laid down by desoxicitidine-kinase. <br /> The active form of Decitabine is incorporated into replicating DNA, replacing the methylated cytosine. Thus, the incorporation of decitabine into the DNA strand has a hypomethylation effect.</p>
<p>After replication daugther cells have a paternal strand that guides the DNA-methyltransferase-1 for the methylation of the new strand. This process could keep the methylation patron, but that is not possible because the methylated C was eliminated, and now the Decitabine is on its place. Decitabine produces the inhibition of DNTM1, because it forms a covalent union with the enzyme. In conclusion, Decitabine has an <strong>anti-tumour effect</strong> because it prevents the metylathion of tumor-suppressor genes that can disrupt the uncontrolled division of cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">The<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><strong><span>DNA methylation</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>is a process that can be maintained during the cell division (mitosis) and sometimes in the meiosis, so epigenetic marks can be inheritable, having a lasting effect. <br /> The<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><strong><span>sensitive periods</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>are periods of time periods during which the genome is more likely to undergo epigenetic modifications or epigenetic processes. Normally, in these periods that take place in the pre-implantation embryo cells and other periods of development, it performs the epigenetic reprogramming. The chromatin is more prone to methylation at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">During the sensitive periods there are a lot of changes in the epigenetic marks that are in the genome. We could suppose that during these periods the genome and the epigenetic are not stabilized. So, if you use a drug that can be able to change the epigenetic behavior, it can be bad for the organism, because the epigenetic reprogramming it isn't completed and the DNA-methylation is more uncontrollable. Thus,<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><strong><span>it</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><strong> </strong></span><strong><span>is not advisable</span></strong>, as it may cause epigenetic changes not to favor the healing of the body, but worsen due to the erroneous methylation or gene silencing.</span></p>
