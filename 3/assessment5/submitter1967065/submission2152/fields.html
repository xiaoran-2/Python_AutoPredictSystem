<p class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip jig-ncbipopper">          As compared with normal cells, the malignant cells show major disruptions in their DNA methylation patterns. DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA. Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing (2).</p>
<p>              The importance of somatic epigenetic alterations in tissues targeted for carcinogenesis is now well recognized and considered a key molecular step in the development of a tumor. Particularly, alteration of gene-specific and genomic DNA methylation has been extensively characterized in tumors, and has become an attractive biomarker of risk due to its specificity and stability in human samples. It also is clear that tumors do not develop as isolated phenomenon in their target tissue, but instead result from altered processes affecting not only the surrounding cells and tissues, but other organ systems, including the immune system. Thus, alterations to DNA methylation profiles detectable in peripheral blood may be useful not only in understanding the carcinogenic process and response to environmental insults, but can also provide critical insights in a systems biological view of tumorigenesis (1). </p>

<br>

<p>        For example, there are two DMRs within the IGF2 gene that may serve independent roles in the regulation of IGF2 imprinting in cancer. Recently, altered methylation of a CTCF binding site in the H19  DMR was described by Nakagawa et al. in colorectal cancers with LOI of IGF2. However, LOI of IGF2 affects both tumor and matched normal mucosa of such patients. However, in the study of Nakagawa et al., normal methylation was generally observed in the normal mucosa with LOI, again consistent with the idea that CTCF is only one of several factors involved in the disruption of genomic imprinting in cancer. However there is role of aberrant methylation of CTCF  target sequences in the deregulation of other potential target sites, such as the INK4a and myc genes.  Cui et.al. found that about half of WTs with normal imprinting of IGF2 also showed aberrant methylation of the H19 DMR. This is consistent with the idea that aberrant methylation is necessary but not sufficient, and that CTCF is only one of several factors involved in the disruption of genomic imprinting in cancer (1). </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the

<p>        Decitabine or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, is a drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It functions in a similar manner to azacitidine, although decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains. 5-AZA-CdR can reactivate tumor suppressor genes silenced by aberrant DNA methylation, a frequent event in all types of cancer. Because this epigenetic change is reversible, it is a good target for 5-AZA-CdR therapy (2).</p>

there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:

<p>        Unlike genetic modifications, epigenetic changes are reversible, making them a therapeutic target, demethylating drugs can reverse the silencing of genes resulting from methylation (2). Rather than killing cancer cells by damaging their DNA or disrupting vital communication pathways, epigenetic therapy attempts to change the behavior of cancer cells by blocking chemical changes to DNA, including a process called methylation  that turns genes on or off. A DNA molecule that is methylated on both strands on the center cytosine. When chemical tags called methyl groups attach to a DNA molecule, genes can be turned on or off. DNA methylation plays an important role in gene regulation in cancer. The concept behind epigenetic treatment is to “reprogram” the network of chemical changes that affect the DNA of cancer cells (1). This reprogramming can alter the activity of critical genes in cancer cells that drive their growth and survival. The treatments can effectively reset DNA methylation (1). But the drugs may be having other effects, epigenetic therapies may affect the structure of chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins that forms chromosomes, which could cause side effects over a long period (1)............... :(cannotput more wordsorry^^V</p>
