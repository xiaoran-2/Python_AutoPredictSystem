    <h1>Submission 818 from Anon (session_user_id: ee4bf37461b32df012e9c768f1590cac3454286f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, a class of drugs that promotes hypomethylation. The drug gets incorporated into the DNA and prevents DNA methyltransferase from copying methylation patterns in daughter cells during cell division. The goal of the drug is to fight locus specific hypermethylation in cancer cells. Although, it is not clear how to target problematic genome regions, dosage control seems to have good results in particular cases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Proximal to genes, CpG rich regions are methylated resulting in low gene expression. Activaly expressed genes, on the other hand, show low methylation of CpG rich regions or CpG islands (in a "sea" of methylated DNA). Cancer cells exhibit a locus specific hypermetylation of CpG islands, with a higher incidence on tumor supressor genes. Locus specific hypermethylation results in gene silencing and thus, also in silencing of the  tumor supressor genes.</p>
<p>Due to extensive methylation, intergenic show low transcription activity. One consequence of this scenario is the silencing of repetitive elements. Cancer cells, show instead a genome wide hypomethylation which results in an increased transcriptional activity on repetitive elements. Repetitive elements are able to recruit the necessary transcriptional machinery and replicate causing traslocations, deletions and insertions. This results in genomic instability. Although, less common, another effect of  genome wide hypomethylation in cancer cells is the increase expression of a series of oncogenes that promote growth and cell division.</p>
<p>Altogether, reduction of tumor supressor gene expression, increase of oncogene expression, and increased activity of repetitive elements throughout the genome promote genomic instability and cancer behavior.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>An example of how locus specific hypermethylation in cancer cells results in genomic instability is that of H19/Igf2 cluster. In normal cells, the patternal ICR and the promoter region of H19 are heavily methylated preventing the binding of the insulator protein CTCF at the ICR. This configuration leaves Igf2 under the effect of enhancers downstream of H19. As a result the patternal allele of Igf2 is expressed. The patternal allele of H19 is not expressed by virtue of being methylated.</p>
<p>By contrast, the maternal ICR and H19 promoter region are not methylated, thus promoting CTCF binding at the ICR. The positioning of the ICR in the middle of H19 and Igf2 and insulating activity of CTCF, leaves the matternal Igf2 allele silenced and H19, under full effect of the downstream enhancers, heavily expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, cancer cells show heavy methylation of both copies of the Igf2/H19 complex, which now resemble the patternal allele of normal cells. Igf2 expression is thus promoted by the same mechanism active in the patternal allele of normal cells in both copies. Being a growth factor, uncontroled expression of Igf2 results in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During mitotic cell division DNA methylation is copied to the daughter cells, making DNA methylation effectively mitotically hereditable. It is this process that supports Dr. Baylin's speculation. Changes in the methylation landscape of a cell will thus be inherited, making the treatment have lasting effects in all progenitors of that cell. This effect is even more visible in cancer cells wich divide much more and more rapidly.</p>
<p>Since, the absorbtion of the drug cannot be localized to cancer cells only, there is an eminent risk that enduring epigentic changes are made to healthy cells. The risk is even higher and with larger consequences if the treatment is applied during epigenetically sensitive periods, i.e., during epigenetic reprograming. There are two sensitive periods. The first, is in the period from the fertilized egg to the blastocyst. The second sensitive period is during the developement of primordial germ cells. Treatment induced changes of the epigenome during sensitive periods can thus have major effects not only on the organism being treated, but also in its progenitors.     </p></div>
