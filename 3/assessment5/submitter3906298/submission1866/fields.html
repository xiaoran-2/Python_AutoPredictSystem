    <h1>Submission 1866 from Anon (session_user_id: 6188b4d27536d45b4209d62d0945a6fa0ce485a7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is found in a promoter of a gene, depending in the level you find it, that would mean that the expression of that gene could be very low or silenced. We know that DNA methylation is mutagenic and mitotically heritable. It also helps mantaining genomic stability but if you find it in a level that is not the correct one, this means that it would have very strong effects in the epigenome, becuase it will continue passing from one generation of the cell to the other one. A sensitive period is a period that depends what happens in that moment, that is how good or bad the effects are going to be in that person life and in the second generation. There are two sensitive periods in development: primordial germ cells, mature egg and sperm cells develpment and the other one is pre implantation and early post implantation. It depends which of this the person has suffered the consequences, this you will find them in the second generation. Is better not to treat a patient during sensitive periods, because whatever you do to the patient in that moment, that's how the results are going to be.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG Islands are likely to be protected from methylation. They are found in the promoters of the genes(the start of the genes). When the CpG Island is methylated it equals silencing of gene expression. This can be seen in the X inactivation. CpG Islands are hypermethylated. They contribute to the disease because when a CpG Island is hypermethylated, this DNA methylation helps in silencing the tumour suppressor genes, so there will be more space available for cancer to reproduce, because there will be nothing that will fight against this bad cells. The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to help maintain genomic stability and integrity. In repetitive elements, DNA methylation helps silencing the repeats to prevent transposition, also to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and we can't forget that methylation of the repeats may prevent illegimitate recombination.  DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements when found in cancer (it is found in every type of cancer ever studied) it features hypomethylation and also genomic instability. The disruption of DNA methylation in this two regions, helps the disease to reproduce faster, because it alters the function of this two basic elements that are the ones that help to keep the cell in a healthy way. One of the function of the repetitive element is the silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, so imagine if a normal cell has this two things affected, it is obvious that it will not be a healthy cell, it will be a unhealthy one and that's what cancer is all about. Is about all this unhealthy cells reproducing faster than healthier ones and attacking them too.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In this case, the paternal allele contains methylated ICR and the maternal allele contains unmethylated ICR with a CTCF insulator protein that can't bind to this unmethylated ICR thanks to the methylated ICR found in the patternal allele. With no binding of the CTCF insulator protein with the unmethylated ICR found in the maternal allele, the DNA methylation makes the H19 promoter silence, so the enhancers can go to the lgf2 in the patternal allele and activate it.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents. It helps slowing the tumour growth if it is combined with a histone-deacetylase and recent studies have shown that if it doesn't help slow the tumour growth in the moment the treatment is provided to the patient, it helps the patient to have better results with the chemeotherapy. Decitabine helps to remove the methylation from the CpG Islands found in the cancer cells and that helps to tranform the cell in a normal one that doesn't have the CpG Islands methylated, they are unmethylated. It have an anti-tumour effect because it helps change the methylation in the bad cells to unmethylation, so when they divide they will produce a healthy cell and this new cell will reproduce more healthy cells and this cicle will continue like that.</p></div>
