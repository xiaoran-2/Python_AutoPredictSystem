    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is not present in CpG islands in normal cells. DNA methylation is altered becoming hypermethylated in cancer cells thus silencing tumor suppressor genes in the process. It has been observed that DNA hypermethylation in CpG islands occurs in all observed forms of cancer to date. We also see a reversal in methylation roles in both the repetitive elements and the intergenic regions. Said another way, in normal cells, we expect to see methylation in both while in cancer cells we see no methylation (hypomethylation) in either.</p>
<p>Once a gene has been hypermethylated, this cell becomes stronger and tends to overcrowd the normal, healthy cells.  Once a cell has been methylated at the repeats and intergenic regions, this creates overall genomic instability and opens the door to abhorrent behavior which, in turn, is mitotichally heritable thus translating any insult to subsequent cell generations. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When imprinting is affected in a cell the growth of that cell is affected. It can come in the form of hyper or hypo methylation and results in abhorrent behavior. One effect can be turning off tumor suppressors while the opposite effect can be a hyper activated growth genes. Both are clearly bad for rampant growth of tumor cells as both allow for high, unchecked growth.</p>
<p>In the example seen here, the paternal allele is active in a normal cell. This is due to a methylated ICR which inhibits CTCF from doing its job as an insulator and allows the enhancers of the allele to express Igf2. The opposite is true on the maternal allele. There is no methylation in the ICR so the CTCF can insulate and the enhancers act only on the H19 but IGF2 will then not be expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor however, the ICR is methylated on both the maternal and paternal alleles so there is twice the IGF2 present which causes the tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. In other words, it acts to suppress DNA over-methylation in the histones thus reducing the silencing of growth genes; namely tumor suppressors. When these are suppressed, tumor growth accelerates due to nothing stopping it.</p>
<p>Since this process is an epigenetic one, that is to say that this hypermethylation is chemically induced, this drug can be hyper-specific in what it is able to treat. In this case, the drug can targets the hypermethylation of the histones and slow it way down. This slowing then slows down the duplication of the tumor cells which means slower growing cancer. Its other benefit is that it won't affect neighboring genes that have normal levels of methylation and function.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter the methylation of cells can affect tumorogenesis by either turning off tumor suppressors or up regulating grown promoters. By altering specific methylation, we can override either action slowing the growth of tumors. Since this is an epigenetic effect, this is mitotically heritable. What this means is that if a cell has altered DNA methylation (hyper or hypo) that this state is passed to the progeny. This would then effectively remove the abhorrent behavior of that cell while keeping the cell itself completely in tact and healthy.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period where a cell is reprogamming its epigenetic marks. This happens early on in early development as well as in germ cell development. During this time, our cells are reprogramming themselves. Treating patients during this time would not be advised because these treatment alter all of the methods used to lay down our epigenetic marks. Our methylation, acetylation, as well as demethylation and deacetylation are all affected. This could have a negative effect outside of the targeted therapy on the methylation (hyper or hypo) of other cells. Interrupting this reprogramming could lead to larger genome-wide consequences.</p></div>
