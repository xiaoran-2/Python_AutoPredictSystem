    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic mark in mammals essential for normal development and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and functions: X-chromosome inactivation in females, genomic imprinting, silencing of repetitive DNA elements, regulation of chromatin structure, and proper expression of genetic information.</p>
<p>CpG dinucleotides  are usually unmethylated in normal cells allowing genes to be transcribed. By the other hand, DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in several tumor types. A cancer epigenome is marked by genome-wide hypomethylation and site-specific CpG island promoter hypermethylation. </p>
<p> These genes silenced epigenetically are commonly involved in cellular processes,  cancer development and progression, including DNA repair, cell cycle, cell adhesion, apoptosis and angiogenesis. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are overexpressed and are responsible for this DNA methylation pattern. Among the DNMTs with catalytic activity, the enzyme DNMT1 maintains the methylation pattern of the DNA during DNA replication. DNMT3a and DNMT3B, unlike DNMT1 present methyltransferase activity increased about demethylated regions.  In CpG islands, usually located in promoter regions of genes, DNMTs catalyze the transfer of a methyl group of the C-terminal domains of the donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to a residue of a cytosine (carbon 5 ') in CpG dinucleotides. In cancer cells, is key to the tumorigenic process.</p>
<p>It also includes, as mentioned above, global hypomethylation presented as the decrease of total methyl-cytosine content in tumor cells compared to normal tissues.In carcinogenesis, the degree of genomic DNA hypomethylation, an early epigenetic alterations found in tumors, injury increases as one progresses from a benign cell proliferation invasive cancer.  These hypomethylation has a consequence depending on where it's happening. This seems to be explained by the consequent generation of chromosomal instability, oncogene activation, reactivation of transposable elements trigger mutations and loss of genomic imprinting.</p>
<p>These repetitive genomic sequences are scattered all over the human genome and are heavily methylated in normal cells. Conversely, in cancer  tend to become hypomethylated, increasing  chromosomal instability by non-coding DNA and transposable DNA elements expression. .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The remarkable discovery that treatment with cytotoxic agents, 5-azacytidine (5-aza-CR) and 5-aza-2#-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR or decitabibe), lead to the inhibition of DNA methylation that induced gene expression and caused differentiation in cultured cells led to the realization of the potential use of these drugs in cancer therapy. These nucleoside analogs get incorporated into the DNA of rapidly growing tumor cells during replication and inhibit DNA methylation by trapping DNA methyltransferases onto the DNA, leading to their depletion inside the cell. This drug induced reduction of DNA methylation causes growth inhibition in cancer cells by activating tumor suppressor genes aberrantly silenced in cancer.  In ohter words, they act <span>reducing promoter hypermethylation tumour supressor genes. A</span>zacitidine and decitabine have now been FDA approved for use in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and promising results have also emerged from the treatment of other hematological malignancies.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span> Several genes important in cancer are imprinted, including</span></span> IGF2 and H19. The parent of origin-dependent expression of the <em>IGF2</em> and <em>H19</em> genes is controlled by the imprinting centre 1 (IC1) consisting in a methylation-sensitive chromatin insulator. The maternally-expressed H19 gene and paternally-expressed Igf2 gene share enhancers and their reciprocal imprinting is governed by a CTCF-dependent insulator that is located between the genes. On the maternal allele  CTCF binds to ICR, generating an insulator that prevents Igf2 from accessing the shared enhancers that are located on the H19 side of the insulator. Thus, the insulator effectively acts as an enhancer-blocker. On the paternal chromosome, methylation at the ICR not only prevents CTCF from binding, allowing Igf2 to engage the enhancers, but it is also required for methylation at the H19 promoter and silencing of H19.</p>
<p><em>IGF2</em><span> undergoes loss of imprinting (LOI) in most Wilms' tumours. </span>In Wilm´s tumors with LOI, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth. LOI of H19 on the maternal chromosome, when it occurs, could occur independently or could be influenced by events in the paternal chromosome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic deregulation occurs early in carcinogenesis and is potentially reversible.  Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because a<span> epigenetic treatment can "reprogram" the network of chemical changes that affect the DNA of cancer cells. In other words, <span>demethylating drugs produce a “memory” antitumor response.</span></span></p>
<p>A sensitive period definition  can be underthe environment, in this case - drug treatment - may be able to influence epigenetic makeup. </p>
<p><span>Early life constitutes a <span class="highlight">period</span> during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. Sensitive periods of development are </span>primordial germ cell development and pre implanted and early post implantation period. On both of these periods are happening active remodelling of the epigenome. So it seems that at these active reprogramming periods,  removal and in laying down of epigenetic marks at different parts in the genome. <br /><span>T</span></p>
<p><span>reating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because, given the lack of specificity inherent to their mechanism of action, particularly on normal cells, as well mechanism of action still unclear, <span>preimplantation environment changes can not only affect developmental processes taking place at that time, but can also have an impact further, affecting offspring health and physiology; and transmitted to the next generation</span></span></p></div>
