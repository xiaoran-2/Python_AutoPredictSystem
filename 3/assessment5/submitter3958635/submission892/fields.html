    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cell methylatiom at CpG islands (near promotor) leads to gene silencing. This silencing by methylation is at different time in different cells.CpG islands of active promoters are unmethylated &amp; weak promoters are methylated.</p>
<p>    In cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated.This activates oncogenes which are kept in silenced state in normal cells. Methylation at CpG islands silence tumor suppressor genes.This leads to cell become tumorigenicHypermethylation of CpGIs varies by tumor type.</p>
<p>   In normal cells, DNA at intergenic &amp; repetitive elements are methylated, it maintains genomic stability (Integrity of genome). Methylation of these sequences -</p>
<p>1) Silence cryptic transcription factor sites</p>
<p> 2) prevents illegitimate recombination</p>
<p>3) Prevent transposition</p>
<p> Methylation at these sequences thus maintain genomic stability oherwise cause aberrations.</p>
<p>             In cancer cells DNA in intergenic region &amp; at repetitive elements are non methylated i.e. Hypomethylation or loss of methylation of these regions. This leads to-</p>
<p>1) Illegitimate recobbination between repeats</p>
<p>2) Activation of repeats &amp; transposition.</p>
<p>3) Activation of cryptic promoters &amp; disruption of neighbouring genes. i.e. by Deletion , Reciprocal translocation, insertions of chromosomal segments.</p>
<p>  e.g. deletion of Dnmt1 in specific tissue increase genomic instability.In humansmutation in Dnmt3B result in ICF syndrome.</p>
<p>  Thus hypermethylation of CpG islands may leads to inactivation of tumor suppressor genes &amp; disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions &amp; repetitive elements may activate oncogenes. This all collaboratively turns cell to become tumorigenic.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally imprintes genes are methylated at early development but demethylated at primordial germ cell development.Genomic imprinting is</p>
<p>1) monoallelic gene expression- only one of two alleles is expressed.</p>
<p>2) Allele specific expression- based on parent - of -origin </p>
<p>Imprinting is associated with DNA methylation at ICR.</p>
<p>The way each ICR bring about imprinted gene expression differs by locus mediated by</p>
<p>  1) Long non coding RNAs</p>
<p>   2) Enhancers/ insulator blocking &amp; others</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">               H19/Igf2 cluster work via enhancer blocking. Normally paternal allele is expresses Igf2 &amp; from maternal allele H19. There is enhancer sequences downstream of H19, enhances expression of H19 gene.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">            Normally, maternal ICR is unmethylated therefore ICR bound with CTCF( insulator protein),which insulates Igf2 expression from downstream enhancers.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">            Paternal ICR kept methylated  blocks binding of CTCF. Withouth CTCF, DNA methylation spreads towards H19 promoter &amp; silence H19 expression.Therefore enhancer sequence is free to acess Igf2 to activate its expression.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">          In Wilms tumor both maternal &amp; paternal alleles expressed. There is hypermethylation of ICR of H19 gene of paternal allele, therefore no binding of CTCF &amp;  Igf2 expresses. Thus in Wims tumor there is double dose of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoting factor &amp; is overexpressed in cancer.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">          Disrupting H19/Igf2 cluster leads to Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome. In this matermal allele behaving like paternal.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
