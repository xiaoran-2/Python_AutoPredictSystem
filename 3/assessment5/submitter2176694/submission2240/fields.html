    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated or hypomethylated compared to the rest of the genome. According to Hassler and Egger, they harbour around 60% of promoters. This may be due to the fact that promoters of tumor suppressor genes need to be kept active. In cancer cells on the other hand, we have CpG islands hypermethylation. This is generally linked to silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Hypermethylation at CpG islands could lead to silencing of tumour suppressor genes via silencing of their promoters. These epigenomic abberrations are mitotically heritable and could hence be one the hits needed for tumorigenesis as postulated by the knudson hypothesis. It should be noted that CpG island hypermethylation also involves CpG island shores and may have an impact on imprint control regions.Hence the common association of CpG island methylation with various cancers.<br />Hypermethylation tends to be most common at intergenic regions and in repetitive elements of normal cells. This is very useful in maintaining genomic stability at these sites. Cancer cells tend to be hypomethylated at these regions. hypomethylation may lead to genomic instability. The latter might be reflected through illigitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats, transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Genomic instability is a common feature in cancer, this is generally the case with the activation of oncogenes.<br /><br /><br /></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele. The enhancers can act on Igf2 becuase CTCF is not bound to the imprint control region. Igf2 is therefore expressed from the paternal allele. On the contrary, the imprint control region being unmethylated on the maternal allele, CTCF binds to it as an insulator element. This will lead to activation of H19 and silencing of Igf2.<br />H19/Igf2 cluster disruption in Wilm's tumor is associated with hypermethylation of ICR on maternal allele as well. This will lead to activation  of Igf2 as is the case with paternal allele. Hence we have double dose of Igf2 produce from both alleles. Since Igf2 is growth promoting, its overexpression is associated with Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA Methyl Transferase inhibitors. It causes a marked decline of histone hypermethylation (The Economist). This is achieved at low non toxic therapeutic doses. The mechanisms of action are not well established. It has been described that, decitabine reduces tumor cell proliferation with little impact on neigbouring cells (The Economist). This might proved to be a better approach, compared to classical chemotherapeutics that comes along with a lot of wariness.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that have an effect on DNA methylation can have a lasting effect beyond the period of treatment because epigenetic modifications are mitotically heritable. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark. Epigenomic modifications as regards DNA methylation are therefore mitotically heritable. Hence, tumour cells that have been subjected to a DNA methylation modifier drug will pass on this state to their daughter cells, as they actively divide.<br />During the development of organisms, senesitive periods refer to periods in which epigenetic marks are actively remodelled. This generally involves, at various stages, clearing of previous epigenetic marks and laying down of new ones. In mammalian development the main sensitive periods are preimplantation early embryonic development and  early germ cell development in the embryo and the young child.<br />If patients were treated with epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods, disruptions to the active epigenetic remodelling in most cells might be achieved. This may lead to unintended long lasting consequences and abberrations in the epigenome of the subjects.</p>
