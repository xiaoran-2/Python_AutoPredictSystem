    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>CpG islands are often found at promoters of gene and they tend to be hypomethylated in the genome. When they are methylated it is universally associated with gene silencing. These methylated CpG island are found at particular times and are dynamically methylated between particular cell types. CpG island methylation leads to silencing mostly because they can be bound by proteins called MecP1 and MecP2 which can alter transcription and condense chromatin.</li>
<li>In cancer cells, promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene.</li>
<li>CpG islands are often found at the promoter of tumor suppressor genes, thus hypermethylation will silence those gene and it can be one of the hits leading to cancer in the Knudson hypothesis. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable it’s a very effective way of silencing a tumor suppressor gene. These epimutations will be rapidly selected because they have a competitive advantage.</li>
<li>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA is usually methylated. In intergenic regions DNA methylation function is to avoid transcriptional interference. In repetitive elements its function is to silence the repeats in order to prevent transposition, illegitimate recombination and also avoid transcriptional interference. All this mechanisms help maintain genomic integrity.</li>
<li>In cancer, these regions tend to become genome-wide hypomethylated. It appears to happen quite early in tumorigenesis and it progresses with time. It’s a very common event in cancer.</li>
<li>This genome-wide hypomethylation contributes to cancer by promoting illegitimate recombination between repeats, transposition of repeats and activation of cryptic promoters causing disruption to neighbouring genes. The overall outcome is genomic instability which is a characteristic feature of cancer.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The H19/Igf2 is paternally imprinted, this means that the imprint control region (ICR) is normaly methylated only in the paternal allele. Because it is methylated, the CTCF protein cannot bind to the ICR and thus the downstream enhancers can act on Igf2 by chromatin looping and promote Igf2’s expression from the paternal allele.</li>
<li>Whereas in the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated. That enables the CTCF protein to bind to that ICR and to act as an insulator protein. That means that it insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers and therefore stops Igf2’s expression from the maternal allele. The enhancers then loop to H19 and enhance its expression.</li>
<li>In Wilm’s tumor, there is a loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster. The ICR is hypermethylated, on the maternal allele as well. That leads to Igf2 expression from both the maternal and the paternal allele so a double dose of Igf2.</li>
<li>Igf2 is an oncogene. This epigenetic disruption is thus growth promoting and is predisposing to Wilm’s tumor.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Once it is laid down by de novo DNA methyltransferases (DNMT 3A and 3B), the DNA methylation is then maintained through DNA replication by DNMT1 which has a preference for hemi-methylated DNA. Therefore DNMT1 can lay down the methylation on the daughter strand of DNA and thus restore the full methylation. This is a very stable mechanism, so altering DNA methylation will have enduring effects on the genome.</li>
<li>A sensitive period is a period when epigenetic marks are erased and reprogrammed. Epigenetic marks can be more easily disrupted during these periods.</li>
<li>The peri-conceptional period, the early embryonic period and the primordial germ cell development period are one of those sensitive periods.</li>
<li>Epigenetic drugs act not only in cancer cells but also in all other tissues. Treating patients during periods of epigenetic reprogramming may interfere with the establishment of the epigenetic marks and have side effects. Treating a pregnant woman may affect the next 2 generations by affecting her embryo and the embryo’s primordial germ cells. Children shouldn’t be treated neither because they still have germ cell maturation.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a DNA methytransferase (DNMT) inhibitor.</li>
<li>It is similar to 5-azacytidine and it acts as a nucleoside analogue. Decitabine gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication and when the DNMT comes along to bind that nucleotide it can no longer be released. Decitabine is an hypomethylating agent.</li>
<li>The role of DNA methylation in tumorgenesis is context dependant and can be dependant on the stage of the disease. Decitabine can thus have an anti-tumor effect on cancers that are driven by tumor suppressor hypermethylation (which can be stage dependant). Additionnaly cancer cells are more severely affected than normal cells because they divide much more rapidly and Decitabine is replication dependant. There may be other ways of action but it is still unclear. Decitabine seems to be most effective in myelodysplastic syndrom maybe because CpG hypermethylation has a poor outcome in that type of cancer</li>
