    <div class="field-value"><p>       Methylation can occur where a cytosine sits adjacent to a guanine (CpG) and serves several important functions in normal cells. CpG islands, or areas of the genome particularly rich in CpGs, occur at the promoters of genes and are typically protected from methylation. When methylation of a CpG island occurs it serves to silence the associated gene. This can be useful to the cell both during normal differentiation and in order to inactivate genetically disruptive transposons.  While CpG islands are usually unmethylated in normal cells, the CpGs in the intergenic regions typically are methylated. These intergenic CpGs serve to support overall chromatin structure as well inactivate repetitive elements and prevent inappropriate crossing over between unlike chromosomes.</p>
<p>       Cancerous cells often display multiple disruptions of epigenetic systems. One type of disruption leads to improper expression of particular genes. The hypermethylation of CpG islands associated with genes known as cancer suppressor genes is one example. The methylation of these regions leads to the silencing of a gene that would ordinarily prevent aberrant cell growth and division. Another example is the hypomethylation of non-CpG-island promoters associated with oncogenes, or genes that promote the improper growth and division of cells.</p>
<p>       The other epigenetic disruption that can lead to cancer is by encouraging over-all genome instability. When intergenic regions containing long segments of repeats become unmethylated, chromosomes that are not analogous are able to align and cross over causing translocations and insertions. The same can occur when the CpG islands associated with transposons become unmethylated, allowing those transposable elements to insert themselves throughout the genome. This can damage the cell in two ways: First, by creating analogous regions on non analogous chromosomes similar to long strings of unmethylated repeats; Second, by inserting themselves within the coding regions of genes and disrupting their function.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The h19/Igf2 cluster is an imprinted region of the genome. It is controlled by an imprint control region (ICR) that is typically methylated on the paternal chromosome and unmethylated on the maternal chromosome. The lgf2 gene lies upstream of the ICR and the H19 gene lies downstream. Further downstream of H19 is a pair of enhancers. These enhancers have a natur affinity for the lgf2 gene and will enhance that gene on the paternal chromosome. On the maternal chromosome where the ICR is unmethylated the protien CTCF binds to the ICR and changes the conformation on the strand and making Igf2 unavailable to the enhancers, which upregulate H19 instead. H19 created a long non-coding RNA that serves as a tumor supressor, while Igf2 is a growth factor. In Wilm's tumor the the imprinting at this ICR has been disrupted in some way, leading to both chromosomes containing a methylated ICR. This is a double hit to the organism by causing both reduced expression of the H19 tumor supressor and over expression of the Igf2 growth factor. This leads to tumors of the kidney that occur early in life.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors known as a DNA-Methyltransferase inhibitors, or DMNTi. Decitabine is a nucleoside analog, meaning that it takes the place of a normal nucleotide in a CpG during replication. When DMNT attempts to bind to the CpG in order to copy the methyl group to the daughter strand post-replication, Decitabine irreversibly binds DMNT making it unavailable for its normal function. Over the course of several replications, this dilutes the amount of methylated DNA and eventually eliminates methylation from the cell at the sites where Decitabine has been incorporated.  Due to the high replication rate in tumors, Decitabine will have a larger effect on them than normal cells. In tumors characterized by hypermethylation the reduction of methylation will have a strong anti-tumor effect; however this is not true for tumors characterized by hypomethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the primary methods in the cell for transmitting epigenetic marks from one cell generation to the next. Once laid down, methylation perpetuates down the cell line through the action of DMNT and other methyltransferase proteins; as a result of this mechanism changes caused by a drug which removes or interferes with methylation will also perpetuate through the cell line. The exception to this process is what are known as sensitive periods. These are periods in which broad epigenetic reprogramming occurs. There are two primary sensitive periods. The first of which is early embryological development just after fertilization. In this period the epigenome is wiped clean, with the exception of imprinted regions, and rewritten as cells divide and differentiate as embryo grows and develops.  The second sensitive period is during the production and maturation of gemetes both in the developing fetus and again during puberty. When gametes are produced, their epigenetic structure is rewritten and oocyte and spermatocyte specific epigenetic imprint marks are applied to the cells. If a substance that interferes with the epigenetic machinery is applied at either of these stages it will have long lasting and possibly severe effects upon the patient. </p></div>
