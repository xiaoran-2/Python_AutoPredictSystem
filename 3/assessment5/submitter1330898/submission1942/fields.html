    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting and X chromosome inactivation. The modification of the C5 position of the cytosine base is found in approximately 70-80% of CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells and to some extend in non-CpG sequences in embryonic stem cells (ESC) .Generally,DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression.Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters.They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state.</p>
<p>However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA.Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing</p>
<p>This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes e controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair e by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands </p>
<p>Another target of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer are CpG island shores, defined as approximately 2 kb regions surrounding<br />CpG islands. These regions were initially identified hypermethylated in colorectal cancer and represent regions of tissue<br />specific methylation in normal tissues </p>
<p>In analogy to genetic mutation, tumors seem to accumulate higher levels of DNA methylation during tumor progression and genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation has proven useful for tumor classification of different tumor types.These defined alterations are currently evaluated for their use as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of therapy response for different cancers</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>The Igf2/H19 region provides a unique model in which to study the roles of DNA methylation and chromatin structure in the regulation of chromosome domains.<span>The insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and H19 imprinted genes control growth and body composition. Adverse in-utero environments have been associated with obesity-related diseases and linked with altered DNA methylation at the IGF2/H19 locus. <span>Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are associated with many imprinted genes. In humans methylation at a DMR upstream of the </span><em>H19</em><span> gene known as the Imprint Control region (IC1) is acquired in the male germline .</span>Postnatally, methylation at the IGF2/H19 imprinting control region (ICR) has been linked with tumor formation. </span></span>In normal cells, the paternal IGF2 and maternal H19 genes are expressed . Several sites upstream of H19 are methylated on the paternal allele  and unmethylated on the maternal allele. In tumors such as Wilm's tumor with Loss of imprintingILOI), the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth. Loss of imprinting of H19 on the maternal chromosome, when it occurs, could occur independently or could be influenced by events in the paternal chromosome.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a class of epigenetic inhibitors belongs to "DNA Demethylation agents" .It will bind to the enzymes responsible for the epigenetic reguation such as methylation of DNA in the regions expressing for the regulatory proteins, transcription factors, and packaging proteins of DNA which is responsible for the cellular process and mechanism. </p>
<p>When the epigenetic drug decitabine is administered it will bind  and inhibit  the epigenetic regulators or the enzymes responsible for adding the methyl groups and silencing the expression </p>
<p>Overactivity of methylation leads to the silencing of the genes they surrounded also,in case if some oncogenes and tumor supressor genes are altered by the epigenetic regulators such as DNA methylation, It will affect the normal cellular machinery and leads to uncontrolled growth called cancer.Thus Decitabine blocking the activity of epigenectic regulators when administered as epigenetic drug it will inhibit the enzymatic regulatory activity and have an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Stephen Baylin A researcher from john hopkins school of medicine in his research found that by administering the combination of histone acetylase inhibitor and azacitidene a methylase inhibitor treated lung cancer other than the lymphomas and leukemias.In his second experiment he found that his trials showed some improvement in the treatment of cancer along with the normal chemotherapy where the epigenetic drugs penetrating the cancer cells made the patients more susceptible to the normal chemotherapy. </p>
<p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome bcause it will pass on to the generations to the daughter cells unless it passes on to the process called "genetic reprogramming" where the epigenetic modifications were erased completerly before passing into the subsequent generations</p>
<p>A Sensitive period is defined as the time where there is high risk of carrying the epigenetic modifications to the further generation during cell division.There will be minimal chance of carrying the modifications before genetic reprogramming or erasing the modifications if not it  leads to the alteration in  cell mechanism ultimately the cancer.</p>
<p>The sensitive period is where the genetic reprogamming or erasing the modification takes place. This stage is critical because by providing the drugs like methylase inhibitors will give a long lasting effect on the epigenome which will be carried through generations hence it is not advisable.</p></div>
