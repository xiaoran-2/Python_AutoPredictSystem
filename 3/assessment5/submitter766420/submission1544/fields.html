    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the CPG islands of a tumour reppressive gene are hypomethylated causing the gene to code for a protein that would regulate the division and death of the cell in the event this cell becomes cancerous.</p>
<p>In a cancer cell the CPG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated. More specifically, when the CPG islands at the promoters of the tumour suppressor genes become methylated, these anti-cancerous genes are silenced. Moreover, when both alleles of a tumour suppressor gene are silenced, the cancerous cells start to divide more rapidly and die less often. Similarly, some birth defect diseases are associated with transcription repression due to turned-off genes brought about by the hypermethylation of the CPG islands. For example, the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis and the neurological disorder alzheimer's disease are both linked to the hypermethylation the CPG islands.</p>
<p>In a normal cell the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hypermethylated to maintain genomic stability by causing the chromatin to tighten to prevent certain non coding DNA sequences from recombining or from transposition. Hence, the integrity of the neighbouring coding sequences would be saved from mutations caused by insertions, deletions, or translocations.</p>
<p>In a cancer cell the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hypomethylated leading to genomic instability through illegitimate recombination, transposition activation, and genes' disruption. Also, some birth defect diseases are associated with the hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. For example, ATRX syndrome (mental disability, is linked to transposition and recombination genomic instability that disrupts the synthesis of the protein ATRX which is responsible for regulating other proteins that are cruicial for mental development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Most imprinted genes are involved in the regulation of an embryo's growth, either promoting it or restricting it. So, for imprinting to occur, hypermethylation or hypomethylation could be required depending on the characteristics of the gene, like what it codes for and which parent it came from.      When the imprint control region (ICR1) is methylated on the paternal allele the enhancers will act on the insulin-like growth factor gene (Igf2) to express it while H19, the gene that restrains growth, is silenced. On the other hand, when the ICR1 is unmethylated on the maternal llele the enhancers will act on H19 to express it while Igf2 is silenced.    In Wilm's tumour both parents' imprint control region are methylated causing both parents' Igf2 to be expressed (double doze) while both parents' H19 are silenced; in addition to cancer this causes an abnormally large abdomen. In general, hypo- or hyper- methylation of ICR1 would disrupt the imprinting at H19/Igh2 cluster. The hypermethylation of ICR1 leads to the hypomethylation of Igf2 and the hypermethylation of H19. This overexpression of Igf2 and underexpression of H19 leads to overgrowth. On the other hand, the hypomthylation of ICR1 leads to the hypermethylation of Igf2 and the hypomethylation of H19. This underexpression of Igf2 and overexpression of H19 leads to growth stunt.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The overexpression of a methyltransferase could lead to the hypermethylation of a tumour suppressor gene. As a result a gene that codes for such an enzyme is often labeled as an oncogene. To try an treat cancers brought about by such overexpressed methyltransferases we need to utilize a drug that would hypermethylate the oncogene to inhibit its methyltransferases, this in turn would lead to the hypomethylation of the tumour suppressor genes. Decitabine is a a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor drug that could accomplish this desired objective. Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltranferase by hypermethylating the oncogene, and thus activating the tumour suppressor genes. This kind of drug could be considred as a revolutionary anti-tumour therapy because it does not involve killing cells directly to get rid of the cancer, only biological switches are re-programmed (on/off).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>By using epigenetic therapy to re-program the genes' switches we are actually passing DNA modulation from cell to daughter cell. As a result, tumour cells would fade away from generation to next generation of a cell without having to kill the parent cell and other normal cells along the way. Thus, by altering DNA methylation through a drug we would be actually inducing a temporary artificial environment for a parent cell. This artificial environment would become a natural environment once inherited by the daughter cell. Now the drug could be stopped, and we have achieved an enduring multi-generational effect on the epigenome by altering DNA methylation.</p>
<p>During development there are two sensitive periods when the paternal and maternal inherited genomes are both hypomethylated and, thus,  susceptible to epigenetic re-programming. First sensitive period is the pre-implantation period, and the second sensitive period is the Primordial germ cell development. Therefore, it would be unwise to expose the embryo to DNA methylation altering drugs during reprogramming susceptibility as those drugs would influence the embryo's methylation outcome.</p></div>
