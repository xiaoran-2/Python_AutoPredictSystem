    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally CpG islands tend to escape DNA methylation, but when they are methylated the effect is often to suppress, or silence, specific genes. In cancer, DNA methylation is disrupted in that the CpG islands get <em>hypermethylated</em>, and this silences <strong>tumour supressor genes</strong> (Or, in other words, we get a <em>loss of imprinting</em>). This disruption of DNA methyalation, i.e. the silencing of tumour supressor genes, leaves the cell more vulnerable to uncontrolled replication. In other words, the silencing contributes to cancer.</p>
<p>In normal circumstances DNA methylation is used to <em>silence</em> intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In cancer they are instead hypomethylated, so that they can be expressed. Expression of these repetitive elements and intergenic regions often lead to genetic errors (translocations, insertions and sometimes deletions), thus the disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine, which is a DNA-demethylating agent, lowers the amount of DNA methylation. In cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands at ICRs is common and can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and </span><em>tumour supressor genes</em><span>. Hence, using a DNA-demethylating agent such as Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by increasing the expression of growth restricting genes and tumour supressor genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region of the paternal allele is methylated (in normal function). This blocks the binding of the insulator protein CTCF to the ICR. Without CTCF bound, the DNA methylation also spreads to the H19 promoter, silencing H19 expression. Again, without CTCF bound, the downstream enhancers are allowed access to Igf2 and can activate its expression.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, in contrast, the ICR is unmethylated, which lets it bind the insulator protein CTCF. This insulator protein binding both counteracts them ethylation of the H19 promoter, allowing H19 expression, and blocks the downstream enhancers from activating Igf9, and instead redirects the enhancer function to H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele. We then have two paternal-like alleles (for example through mutation or deletion leading to loss of imprinting or through uniparental disomy), which leads to overexpression of the growth promoting gene Igf2.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Since Igf2 is a growth promotor, and since the disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster leads to overexpression of Igf2, we might get uncontrolled cell growth. Hence disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster could be an important part of many cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects since it is mitotically heritable, that is, after a cell has gained the methylation markers its daughter cells will inherit them too. If this would happen during the development of germ line cells, this <em>might</em> mean that the epigentic marks may be inherited by the next generation, too.</p>
<p>A “sensitive period” means, in this context, a period of development where new epigenetic marks are laid down (or, stated differently, a period during which the the cell is being epigenetically reprogrammed). Some of these sensitive periods are the period from the primordial gem cells to the production of mature eggs and sperm, the pre-implantation period and the early post-implantation period.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Interfering with DNA methylation during this period might be inadvisable. For example, if a couple was trying to become pregnant and if during this time either of them were taking DNA methylation-affecting medication, the epigenetic reprogramming of the early embryo might go wrong, and the correct gene expression during development would not take place.</p></div>
