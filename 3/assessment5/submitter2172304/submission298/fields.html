    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the epigenetic marks.DNA methylation in the promoter regions is inversely correlated with the gene expression.A lot of genes in the human genome initiate transcription from the elevated content of CpG dinucleotides which are rich in G+C base pairs referred to as CpG islands. These CpG islands in the promoter regions of the gene are <strong>normally not methylated</strong>.These housekeeping genes are encoded at all cell types. The genes that have non-CpG promoter have a restricted expression pattern and they will be expressed later in development during tissue differentiation.</p>
<p>The CpG islands in promoter regions of genes in a normal cell are kept free of methylation whereas in the cancer cell these CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated which causes silencing of the gene (no expression of the gene).The same is opposite in the intronic regions (DNA between 2 exons), intergenic regions (DNA between 2 genes) and repetitive elements. These are methylated in a normal cell and controlled in expression and creating aberrant mutations (prevent unwanted chromosome translocations and recombinations) whereas, in a cancer cell they are non-methylated and cause genome instability and also deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes.</p>
<p>These altered epigenetic patterns may cause cancer. The <strong>hypermethylation</strong> of the promoter CpG islands cause <strong>silencing of the tumor suppressing genes</strong> that whose job is to control cell cycle and encode proteins that carry over the normal cell repair. The CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype) were first identified in colorectal cancer and later also found in glioma and breast cancer.There are single genes that are studied to be undergoing the CpG island hypermethylation and are noted to cause diseases like MLH1 gene in colorectal cancer, BRCA1 in breast cancer,MGMT in gliomas and colorectal tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/IgF2 cluster is an example of imprinting in genes.The H19 gene is maternally expressed and IGF2 is paternally expressed but both share the same enhancers and their reciprocal imprinting is done by a CTCF-dependent insulator that is located between the genes.In the <strong>maternal allele</strong> the ICR (imprinting center) and H19 gene are unmethylated and are expressed .The CTCF binds within the ICR,this serves as an insulator and prevent IGF2 from accessing the shared enhancers that are expressed from the active H19 gene . Therefore the IGF2 is not expressed in maternal allele.In the <strong>paternal allele</strong>, the ICR and the H19 genes are methylated. H19 gene is not expressed and CTCF cannot bind to the ICR. This allows the IGF2 to engage the enhancers and silencing of H19 gene.</p>
<p>By keeping one allele inactive, there is enough protein needed for the normal growth. If this cluster is disrupted and it can be in a situation where both the alleles are hypomethylated or hypermethylated then there is decrease or increase of the <strong>growth hormone</strong> produced.</p>
<p><strong>Wilm’s tumour</strong> is a disease condition where more of the IGF2 protein is released because both the alleles are hypermethylated at H19 gene and the IGF2 are activated to translate protein.There is a double dosage of growth promoter hormone.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltranferase inhibitors(<strong>DNMT</strong>i). This drug is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (<strong>MDS</strong>). Chemically it is an <strong>analogue</strong> of the nucleoside2-deoxycytidine.It has an anti-neoplastic effect and directly incorporates into DNA upon replication and inhibits the action of DNA methyltransferases that copy methylation to daughter strand which is irreversibly bound and cannot be released .This means the action of DNA methyltransferase is <strong><em>division dependent</em></strong>. The cancer cells are actively replicating and are more affected. The hypermethylation of the tumour suppressor gene is erased as the new daughter DNA are replicated under this drug treatment .Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that has an anti-tumour effect.It belongs to the category of chemotherapy called <strong>antimetabolites</strong> which when incorporated within the targeted cancer cells have a direct cytotoxic effect that causes rapid death of tumor cells .Trials in using this drug are being done in treating other tumours,including solid ones.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark in the human genome that switches the expression on  &amp; off of the genes .If there is overmethylation of regions that regulate the tumour suppressor genes then these genes cannot stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.</p>
<p>Epigenetic<strong> reprogramming</strong> occurs in two important periods,early<strong> embryonic  development</strong> and the<strong> primordial germ cell development</strong>.These are considered the sensitive periods during embryo development. There is demethylation occurring in the early embryonic period in both maternal and paternal genome. Methylation marks are again laid on during the primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>The epigenetic changes are passed from one cell to the two daughter cells during cell division.The drugs that are in market for treating the tumour cells are targeted to create epigenetic changes to the tumour cell in order to control the abnormal metastasis and these erased marks are passed to future cell and thereby there is no need to keep treating the patient.</p>
<p>These epigenetic drug treatments cannot be used on younger patients during the sensitive periods when there is defined reprogramming of DNA methylation occurring in the germ cells. Any alterations in methylation using these epigenetic drugs will effect  the normal laying of epigenetic marks.</p></div>
