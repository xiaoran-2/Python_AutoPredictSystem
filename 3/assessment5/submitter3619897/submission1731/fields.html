    <h1>Submission 1731 from Anon (session_user_id: 7d61130df1dfd955454d278cec5c3b228350a83c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation plays a large role in the gene expression profile and thus function of each cell.  DNA methylation patterns are stable and mitotically heritable "instructions" for gene expression.  In the event that a drug is used to alter the DNA methylation pattern, any changes resulting from the treatment will be passed on to the daughter cells.  Treatment can potentially have drastic effects on the DNA methylation pattern and gene expression profile of the cell.  <span style="font-size:14px;">Epigenetically sensitive periods in development are times in which the epigenome is undergoing a major change (reprogramming) .  The most sensitive times in development are in early embryonic development (fertilization to gastrulation)  and during primordial germ cell development.  </span><span style="font-size:14px;">During these sensitive periods of development the epigenome is being reprogrammed, the majority of DNA methylation is being removed and reestablished.  If a patient were to be treated with drugs that alter DNA methylation during these sensitive periods the result could be altered DNA methylation across the genome, having drastic effects on gene expression and basic cellular function (the exact result is hard to predict because the changes would occur at random locations, cancer is certainly a possibility).  </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cytidine analog which is incorporated into the DNA upon replication and acts as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  When the DNMT attempts to methylate the Decitabine "CpG" cite, it binds irreversibly to the cite and is thus removed from further cellular activity.  <span style="font-size:14px;">Overall, treatment with Decitabine will result in global DNA hypomethylation, as the DNMT enzymes (normally add methyl groups to the DNA) are rendered inactive.  </span><span style="font-size:14px;">Tumor cells generally have CpG island hypermethylation within the promoter regions of genes, which results in silencing of genes that should be active (ie. tumor suppressor genes).  If a tumor is "caused" by the inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene (ex. Rb) it may respond favorably to Decitabine treatment as the drug will reduce the level of methylation across the genome, including the hypermethylated promoter and result in reactivation of the tumor suppressor gene.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Specific DNA methylation patterns in the imprint control region (ICR) of genes allow parent-of-origin specific gene expression.  In the case of the <em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster the paternal allele is methylated at the ICR and the <em>H19 </em>promoter, resulting in silenced <em>H19 </em>and activated <em>Igf2</em>.  <span style="font-size:14px;">For the maternal allele, the ICR and </span><em style="font-size:14px;">H19 </em><span style="font-size:14px;">promoter are not methylated, allowing the CTCF insulator protein to bind the ICR and insulate </span><em style="font-size:14px;">Igf2</em><span style="font-size:14px;"> from the enhancer proteins, this results in </span><em style="font-size:14px;">H19</em><span style="font-size:14px;"> expression and </span><em style="font-size:14px;">Igf2</em><span style="font-size:14px;"> silencing.  </span><span style="font-size:14px;">Wilm's tumor is a childhood tumor of the kidney.  It is caused by altered imprinting resulting in the maternal allele behaving like the paternal allele.   This results in the individual expressing two copies of </span><em style="font-size:14px;">Igf2</em><span style="font-size:14px;"> instead of only one copy.  </span><em style="font-size:14px;">Igf2</em><span style="font-size:14px;"> is a growth promoting oncogene.  Therefore, when the imprinting is disrupted the effects are drastic.  In the event that the maternal allele becomes methylated like the imprinted paternal allele, there will be overexpression of </span><em style="font-size:14px;">Igf2</em><span style="font-size:14px;"> and twice the growth promoting effects.  If the paternal allele loses its imprint then both alleles will look like the maternal allele and there will be no </span><em style="font-size:14px;">Igf2</em><span style="font-size:14px;"> expressed; this could result in growth retardation or perhaps even apoptosis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In general, CpG islands tend not to be methylated.  When there is DNA methylation of CpG islands (particularly in the promoter region of a gene) the normal result is to silence gene expression.  In cancers however, there tends to be drastic increase in the frequency of CpG island methylation.  This hypermethylation results in silencing of genes that would normally be actively expressed within the cell.  When these silenced genes have a role in carcinogenesis they are considered tumor suppressor genes - ie. genes that normally suppress tumor formation.  Tumor suppressor genes usually function in some way to control the growth of the cell, when they are silenced they can no longer limit growth.  Obviously, increased growth potential is a key factor in tumorigenesis.  </p>
<p>In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements throughout the genome are usually highly methylated.  This methylation promotes genomic stability by reducing the incidence of translocations, protects the genome from transposable elements, prevents mutation from C to T transition.  In cancers the intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated compared to normal cells.  <span style="font-size:14px;">This hypomethylation seems contribute to the overall genomic instability observed in cancer cells.  The hypomethylation changes the chromatin structure from heterochromatin to more open euchromatin which makes it much more vulnerable to mutation, translocation,  and improper recombination.  It can also lead to the activation of nearby cryptic promoters and alter gene expression profiles.  All of these factors are regularly observed in cancerous cells, but it is as of yet unclear which factors are causal and which are secondary effects.  It is very likely that the precise role of the altered epigenome is unique to each tumor or at least each tumor type.</span></p></div>
