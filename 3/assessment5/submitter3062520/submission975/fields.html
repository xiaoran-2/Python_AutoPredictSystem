    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is important in gene regulation and genomic stability. Normally, CpG islands, which often function as gene promoters, remain unmethylated so RNA polymerase can bind and transcribe the mRNA. At the same time, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in the DNA are usually methylated, which tends to promote gene stability. In cancer, however, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated (know as CpG hypermethylation) while the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are more likely to be unmethylated (genome-wide hypomethylation).</p>
<p>CpG island hypermethylation causes a disruption between the DNA and RNA polymerase, prohibiting the expression of the gene the DNA sequence downstream of the CpG island codes for. This can lead to cancer if the sequence codes for a cancer suppressor gene. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the silencing of these genes will be spread to any daughter cells of the cancerous cell. If this modification gives these cells an advantage over neighboring cells, then this could lead to greater division and/or longer life of these cells, which is how cancers can begin.</p>
<p>Genome-wide hypomethylation occurs in repetative elements in the DNA as well as intergenic regions, such as CpG poor promoters. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements can lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats, and activation of cryptic promoters. These can lead to deletions and insertions within the DNA as well as reciprocal translocations within or between chromosomes. This genomic instability can lead to cancer. It is also possible to have hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters. This is associated with activation of those genes which can lead to cancer if the activated gene is an oncogene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, normally the imprinting controll region is methylated on the paternal side while remaining unmethylated on the maternal side. In the maternal allele, CTCF (an insulator protien) binds to the unmethylated controll region. This insulates Igf2 from enhancers downstream. These enhancers will instead enhance the expression of H19 on the maternal allele. On the paternal side the controll region is methylated, CTCF cannot bind to the site, and the enhancers are free to enhance the expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>In cancer, imprinting can be disrupted. In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, there can be hypermethylation of the controll region on the maternal allele. Now CTCF does not bind to the controll region on the maternal allele. This causes production of extra Igf2 since both the maternal and paternal alleles will now code for the protien. This, in turn, leads to Wilm's tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor, gets incorporated into the DNA. When DNA methyl transferase comes to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, it is <span>permanently</span> bound to the DNA strand and cannot be released. Therefore the methylation markers are not laid down on the daughter strand at all and are not propagated to the new cell. This means that Decitabine is division dependent (since methylation transfer occurs during cell division) and therefore affects cell types that divide quickly, such as cancer cells, more than other cell types. Therefore, in the correct dosage, Decitabine can effecively be used to target cancer cells when treating patients.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable to daughter cells. Therefore, if the methylation of the DNA in a cell is modified, these modifications will be transmitted to the daughter cells and persist until they are actively erased. This means that the effects of a drug that affects DNA methylation will persist even after the patient stops taking the drug. A problem with this treatment can be using it during sensitive periods of development. These are periods when the DNA methylation of the epigenome is being rewritten and occurs during early development after the egg is fertilized, and during development of the gametes. In these sensitive periods, DNA is being demethylated and remethylated. Because of this, giving epigenetic modifying drugs to patients currently going through sensitive periods could affect how this process occurs and can greatly impact the epigenome of the person. If these drugs are given during the remethylation cycle, methyl groups may not be laid down on new cells. Since this change is mitotically heritable, it will persist to all future cellular generations, affecting the development of the person.</p></div>
