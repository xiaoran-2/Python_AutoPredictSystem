    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells DNA methylation at <strong>CpG</strong> islands prevents transcription and thus the methylation pattern controls what DNA is expressed.  However in cancerous cells this normal DNA methylation pattern is disrupted. It is common to find genes with CpG islands, and island shores, displaying DNA <strong>hypermethylation</strong>. This hypermethylation gives rise to changes in transcription, frequently deactivating tumour suppressor genes.  Conversely, in some instances where genes have CpG poor promoters, it is hypomethylation gives rise to <strong>altered transcription</strong>.  This altered methylation at CpG islands and promoters leads to tumorigenesis and cancerous disease symptoms.</p>
<p>In the introns, intergenic regions and <strong>repetitive elements</strong> of normal cells it is common to observe methylated DNA preventing transcription or activation.However, in cancerous cells normal methylation patterns are disrupted thus the introns, intergenic and repetitive elements display <strong>hypomethylation</strong>.  This disruption of methylation pattern, particularly that observed at the repetitive regions, gives rise to <strong>genomic instability</strong>. Aberrant chromosome pairing during cell division gives rise to deletion, insertion and reciprocal translocation of entire genomic regions.  Similarly, some repetitive regions can be activated thus causing gene expression to be altered. The transcriptional changes brought about by all the above alterations are the cause of tumorigenesis and cancerous disease symptoms.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer. This comparison of cancerous vs noncancerous H19/Igf2 gene cluster is a good illistration.</p>
<p>In a normal (imprinted) cell the H19/lgf2 cluster has a paternal allele with a methylated ICR, this allows the enhancers to act upon, and express, Igf2 because CTCF is not binding to the ICR.  The maternal allele of the H19/lgf2 cluster in a normal (imprinted) cell has an unmethylated ICR. Due to this lack of methylation CTCF will bind an insulator element allowing the enhancers to act upon H19, lgf2 is not expressed (silent) in this scenario.</p>
<p>In a patient with ‘Wilm’s tumour’ imprinting at the H19/lgf2 cluster is lost and hypermethylation is observed i.e. both maternal and paternal ICRs are methylated. Consequently both maternal and paternal alleles express Igf2. This double dose of Igf2 promotes growth and is associated with the childhood kidney disease ‘Wilm’s tumour’.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an enzymatic epigenetic anti-cancer drug. Chemically it is a cytidine analog and is also known as 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine. It is marketed under the name Dacogen, is administered intravenously and acts by causing DNA–demethylation. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMTi) and consequently encourages DNA hypomethylation thus reversing methylation which caused the tumour. It is used to treat the blood/bone marrow cancers myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter the status of a cells DNA methylation change the cells gene expression, or rather switch genes on/off.  These on/off effects can last beyond the period of drug treatment because a cell is able to maintain its methylation status. Hence if the drug causes a ‘reset’ a new status could be maintained thus bringing about enduring effects on the epigenome. In this modified 'reset' state the cells may react differently to chemotherapy drugs when compared to their pre-epigenetic treatment state. Humans naturally ‘reset’ their epigenome when developing primordial germ cells (eggs or sperm) and just after fertilisation. During these times the genome is considered more vulnerable than normal to epigenetic reprogramming hence these are termed ‘sensitive periods’. Administering an epigenetic cancer drug to patients during a sensitive period would be very likely to cause undesirable effects to unborn offspring. This is most likely to affect women with cancer who are of a child bearing age.</p></div>
