    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The point between a Cytosine and a Guanine are often found methylated, but when many of these sites are grouped together, these are collectively known as CpG islands.  They are normally left unmethylated and not expressed.  However, in cancer, CpG islands are often hypermethylated, which means that they are methylated even when they should not be.  DNA methylation can silence tumor suppressor genes,.  For example, researchers know that in skin cancer, there are certain CpG islands that are hypermethylated.</p>
<p>In the normal intergenic regions and repetitive elements, CpGs are usually methylated to discourage expression.  However, in cancer, these regions are hypomethylated, lacking methylation, across the general genome.  Therefore, the promoters that would normally be silenced would now be activated.  This hypomethylation occurs early and progresses with time.  The hypomethylation deteriorates genomic stability, as genes from different chromosomes can be illegitimately recombined.  In cancer, this causes deletions, reciprocal translocations, and insertions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is a paternally expressed gene.  On the maternal side, H19 is unmethylated and expressed, leading to the expression of the CTCF protein.  CTCF blocks the downstream enhancer's ability to access Igf2, so therefore Igf is silenced on the maternal side.  However, on the paternal side, the H19 gene is methylated, and thus silenced, and so is the upstream CTCF.  Now, the enhancers can directly access the Igf2 gene and it is expressed paternally.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the maternal CTCF is silenced, and the H19 gene is methylated, so it acts like a paternal gene.  This causes overexpression of the Igf2 gene.  Since Igf2 is growth-promoting, having double the amount of Igf2 causes the cells to grow more rapidly than the surrounding ones.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  Decitabine helps demethylate DNA by preventing the production of DNA methyltransferase.  DNA methyltransferase is essential to the preservation of DNA methylation during cell replication (when the DNA is reproduced), so without it, the DNA will no longer stay methylated.  If the tumor is caused by tumor suppressor hypermethylation, then removing some of the methylation will help surpress the genes that are causing tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methlylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome because it is mitotically heritable.  Drugs can alter methylation in a number of ways.  For example, piRNAs can direct DNA methylation using RNA, leading to gene silencing.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is the clearing or resetting of the epigenetic marks in the genome. The two sensitive periods of development are the primordial germ cell development, and the period in early development between fertilization and the formation of the epiblast.  These periods would not be a good time to treat patients.  This is because this is the period of time in which the genome is most sensitive to environmental factors, so treating patients during this period could create a host of unpredictable side effects due to the changing of the epigenetic structure.</p></div>
