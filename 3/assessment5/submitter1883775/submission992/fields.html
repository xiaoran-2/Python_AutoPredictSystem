    <div class="field-value"><p>     DNA methylation regulates gene expression by selectively silencing CpG islands at the promoter site. This allows cells to differentiate by function, i.e. liver cells, heart cells etc,. This also allows for dosage compensation especially in X inactivation. The DNA methylation at CpG islands also can be the result of imprinting processes, such as the H19/Igf2 cluster.</p>
<p>     Cancer can be the result of disruption of DNA methylation of CpG islands. There is locus specific hypermethylation at CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes, when these genes are silenced the tumor grows more aggressively and resists programmed cellular death. There is also loss of imprintinq at ICR's which leads to over or underexpression of dose specific gene products.</p>
<p>     The methylation at CpG islands which silences the tumor suppressor genes allows the abnormal cells to proliferate. The effect can also spread to surrounding genes and is mitotically inheritable in daughter cells. The effects of this spread is cumulative and each generation becomes increasingly abnormal.</p>
<p>     DNA methylation silences the intergenic regions and repetitive elements so they do not negatively effect the function of a gene.The methylation ensures that the portions of the gene which are used to ultimately form proteins code for the correct sequence.</p>
<p>     In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethelated which contributes to genomic instability by causing illegitimite recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transpositions and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes. This cascade of factors is cumulative, increasing genomic instability with each new generation. Genomic and chromosomal instablity caused by hypomethylation of intergenic and repetitive elements can,in specific tumors, enhance tumor genesis .</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>     The paternal imprint control region is methylated in the H19/Igf2 cluster allowing enhancers to act upon the Igf2 which results in the expression of Igf2. The maternal imprint control region is unmethylated, which produces CTCF which binds an insulator element which causes the enhancers to act on H19 which results in the expression of H19 and the silencing of Igf2. This allows for the correct dosage of Igf2.</p>
<p>      In Wilm's tumor there is a loss of imprinting at the ICR resulting in hypermethelation on both the maternal and paternal allele. This leads to H19 being silenced on both alleles and Igf2 expressed on both alleles.  This allows the over expression of Igf2.  The cell gets a dose from both the maternal and paternal alleles which promotes growth in the cell. Because the epigenetic change is mitotically inheritable all the daughter cells will grow more aggressively.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>      Decitabine is DNA methyltransferase inhibitor or DNMTi. Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase thereby causing a decrease in the rate of hypermethylation at CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes. These changes are passed down to susequent generations.  </p>
<p>      In conjunction with a histone-deacetylase inhibitor, Decitabine can slow tumor growth by irreversibly binding DNMT's after they are incorporated into DNA which is transfered to the daughter cells of a rapidly growing cancer.  It may also increase the abnormal cells susceptability to standard chemotherapy drugs. The erasure of deleterious epigenetic marks could potentially result in stopping cancerous growth without destruction of all of the cancer cells.</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>      Epigenetic marks are mitotically inheritable, changes in the epigenetic marks are passed down to the daughter cells. While using epigenetic drugs to alter DNA methylation can result in a positive outcome it is important to be cognizant of sensitive periods where use of these drugs are contraindicated.</p>
<p>     Sensitive periods refer to the periods when epigenetic marks are erased such as after fertilization and primordial germ cell development. Studies have shown that enviromental factors in utero and early childhood can alter epigenetic marks. Young patients, exposed to epigenetic drugs, could suffer disruption of the epigenetic mechanism in their germ cells which could have deleterious transgenerational consequences. Similarly, pregnancy would be a definative contraindication for treatment with epigenetic drugs.</p>
<p>     Epigenetic marks are crucial to cell structure and function. Epigenetic drugs do not at this time differentiate between a normal and abnormal cell. The action which results in tumor suppression in a cancer cell could just as readily supress a necessary epigentic mark in a normal cell causing a deleterious outcome. The use of these drugs in sensitive periods could result in long term and potentially transgenerational effects.</p></div>
