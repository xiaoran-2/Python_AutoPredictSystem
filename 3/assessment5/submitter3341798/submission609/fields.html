    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation comprises the modification of C5 position of the cytosine base.</p>
<p>CpG islands aren't normally methylated. However, when methylated, the downstream gene is silenced. In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated which results in gene silencing. If this methylation occurs in the proximity of a tumour suppressor or growth restricting gene, this gene will be silenced and no longer will be transcribed, giving rise to a hit which can, in addition to others previosly occured, cause disease.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements are normally heavilly methylated as a method of keeping DNA packaged into heterochromatin, allowing chromosome stability. This is particularly important for chromatid association. Hypomethylation of integenic regions and repetitive elements is usually associated with chromosome instability due to chromatin decondensation which makes it more accessible to alterations, uncontrolable, most of the times. This chromosome instability can be due cromosome rearrangements and  unstable translocations, variable copy number of genes which can give rise to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 and ICR are methylated in the paternal chromosome and therefore silenced. This implies that CTCF doesn't bind to ICR and the enhancers downstream H19 will promote Igf2 transcription. On the other hand, in the maternal chromosome, the H19 and ICR are not methylated, which allow the binding of CTCF to ICR, which as an insulator won't let access to upstream Igf2. In this case, the enhancers will act on H19 and enhace its transcripton.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour occurs by loss imprinting in Igf2 . There's an aberrant activation of the normally repressed maternally inherited allele, which behaves like the paternal allele, causing upregulation of Igf2, which is an oncogene and growth promoter.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is usual to observe an increase of methylation in cancer cells, namelly in CpG islands, which determine the transcription of certain genes. Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferases and it results in less DNA methylation and therefore in an aproximation to the methylation state of normal cells. This, in its turn, can restore the state of heterochromatin and growth promoting genes are no longer transcribed, resulting in an anti-tumour effect by repairing the steady-state in growth-promoting and growth supressing proteins .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotic heritable, however epigentic marks are removed and re-established at determined periods in time. A sensitive period is a period of time when there is active remodelling of epigenome. Early embryonic development and gametogenesis are both sensitive periods. These periods are very important for development as methylation pattern is established. If a DNA demethylating agent was applied, there would be no restauration of imprinting marks.</p></div>
