    <div class="field-value"><p>An hypermethylation of DNA could lead to a silencing of some genes and an hypomethylation could lead to a overexpression of others. Most epigenetic modification, by whatever mechanism, are erased with each new generation, during gametogenesis and after fertilization. However, since 2005 scientists believes and suggests that epigenetic changes may endure in at least four subsequent generations of organisms ( Weinhold, B.). The environement factors are determinant to change this DNA methylation and is mitotic heritable.</p>
<ul><li>In normal cells most of the CpG islands are not methylated ( they are hyypomethylation), but the introns between genes are so the repetetive elements and the intergenic regions are which make the silencing of some genes and genomic stability.</li>
<li>In cancer we verify a swap, most of the CpG are  methylated ( hypermethylation) so we can talk about  CpG hipermethylated and the opposite occurs on the repeats, intergenic regions and and introns.</li>
<li>That contributes to the disease, because some of tumor supressor genes can be silenced and is mitotic heritable, so the cells are always dividing and take advantage among others cells.</li>
<li>In these regions that are the most genomic wide the DNA is methylated.</li>
<li>In cancer we verify a hipomethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. It's more comum in the repeats that on CpG poor promoters.</li>
<li>DNA methylation allows genomic stability that must occurs in normal cells. In cancer as  intergenic regions are hipomethylated, it could occurs illegimatte recombinations between repeats because the cromatine is more open, less package; activation of the repeats and transpositions, activations of cryptical promoters and disruptions of neighbouring genes. when DNA hipomethylation occurs ont the CpG poor promoters leads ont the activation of some genes that wouldn't be activate.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that belongs to DNA-demethylating agents that is an inhibitor that traeat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursores of a kind of leukaemia. That drugs is so targeting enzymatic epigenetic regulators.</li>
<li>This drug decreased the DNA methylation of DNA methyltransferase (DNMTi) , that is the enzyme responsable to attach metyl groups to histones proteins, so is an hypometylating drug. This overmetylation  silence some genes such a tumor-supressor that have the role to control cell growth.</li>
<li>If we apply a drug like Decitabine, the DNA methyltranferase is blocked and do not attach metyl groups, because some nucleoside analogue irreversibly bind DNMTs, so the genes like tumorsupressor aren't silenced and do their job, controlling tumor growth that will decreased. To act it need cells into division, as tumour cells divide mor rapidly the will be mor affected than the normal cells.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Epigenetic alterations are reversibles, but they have transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and the environment leads to an alterational on DNA methylation. So any environmental factors such as a drug to treat cancer could change this DNA metylations and cuases disorders.</li>
<li>During sensitive period  the epigenetics marks are erased, excepted for the repeats that remains highly methylated. This is a period of reprogramming, a period when epigenetic marks are remodelled. The methylation decreased on the maternal and paternal genome but not the same way. The paternal genome metylation decreased more rapidly. the imprinted metylation is high on the second sensitive period but decreases onth the first.</li>
<li>There are two sensitive periods during the development - the first is from  primordial germ cells until gametes prodution and the second is since pre implantation until early pos-implantation. </li>
<li>Treating patients during this sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the patterns of methylation can be change, can change the reprogramming of DNA and  because of this epigenetic alteration  on the promoters that can be more or less methylated, some genes can be turn on or turn off. So during this periods the cells are more vulnerable to epigentic an genetic alterations.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>On the paternal allele the ICR are  methylated and not binding by CTCF. As there is not an insulator protein the enhancers goes diractly to Igf2 and so thers is an expression of Igf2.</li>
<li>On the maternal allele the ICR  are not methylated, that means they are binding by an insulator protein called CTCF, that insulates Igf2 to downstream enhancers that allow the expression on H19, an lncRNA (H19), only produced on the maternal allele. THe enhancers loops to Igf that doesn's expresses itself.</li>
<li>Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome is an imprinted disorder, which leads to among other things to a predisposition to embryonic childhood tumours, like Wilm's tumour because maternal allele behave like a paternal allele, so there is an upregulation of Igf2, an oncogene, so it promove the growth, but also a loss of Cdkn1c, a tumour supressor. These two clusters are linked.</li>
<li>The disease happens due to an overexpression of Igf2. So the cells growth more because they have more Igf2(oncogene) and less Cdkn1c ( gene supressor) , as they have mutation/deletion that causes loss of imprinting, two copies of one parental chromosome (here paternal) or epigenetic loss of imprinting (rare).</li>
