    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Normal function of DNA methylation</strong></p>
<p>DNA is a double helix structure with 4 base strands of Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine and Adenine where Adenine and Thymine are opposite base pair and Guanine and Cytosine are the other two base pair. Methylation occurs at Cytosine base where the methyl group CH3 is provided by SAM(S adenesylmethionine) and is converted to SAH(S-adensyl homocysteine). This process is recycled back to SAM in the presence of cofactor B12. The Cytosine base gets converted to 5-methylcytosine by presence of one or more group of enzyme Methyl-Transferase. This process happens in Cytosine base which is linked to Guanine base providing CpG island or di-nucleotide pair.  In normal cells one will see hypomethylation of CpG island  at promoter regions and there is methylation in the repetitive elements and intergenetic regions. So gene silencing at promoter regions, helps to maintain genomic stability, it is laid down by DNA methytransferase,  and it is mitotically heritable</p>
<p> In the repetitive elements  there are proteins that make copies of themselves and pace themselves in between genes. If become overactive, the process of deletion or replication or reciprocal translocation into each other positions can happen. In normal situation if methylated then they are able to silence the repeats to prevent transposition and prevent mutation of repeats also prevent transposition and illegitimate recombination of genes. In cancer cells the opposite process happens there is hypermethylation within CpG island at promoter region and hypomethylation along the genome and localized areas such as repetitive elements and intergenic regions. Kundson indicated that there should be at least two insults to the genes for cancer cells to develop. <span>DNA hypomethylation activates oncogenes and initiates chromosome instability, whereas DNA hypermethylation initiates silencing of tumor suppressor genes </span>which are designed  to suppress cancer cells. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted centers(ICs) are regions of DNA that control the parental specific regulation of gene expression, which are usually expressed by DNA methylation, histone marks and the presence of non-coding RNAs. In the disease situation there is disruption of imprinting occurs. H19 non-coding RNA is expressed from maternal chromosomes. H19 and IGF2 (IGF2 insulin Growth factor 2) are closely linked as they are expressed in the same tissue during fetal development. In disease state  there is loss of imprinting due to CpG methylation that is inherited or mutated at the promoter regions of maternal chromosomes H19. Hypermethylation of H19 promoter on the maternal allele has vital role in IGF2 expression at paternal allele. <span> </span></p>
<p> In Wilms' tumor (WT) there is activation of  silent maternal allele of the insulin-like gowth factor-II (IGF2) gene, and  silencing of the normally active maternal allele of the H19 gene. Normally, the IGF2 gene  only the copy inherited from a person's father is active. In  cancers, however, both the paternal and the maternal copies of the gene are active, therefore too much IGF 2 are in the cells produced which then stimulate the growth of tumours cells. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>

    <div class="field-value"><p> Decitabine drugs are DNA methyl transferase inhibitors and are used for  example in treatment of  myelodysplastic syndrome.</p>
<p> The bone marrow of a patient with MDS, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, contains of majority cancer cells.  The mutations  make methyl transferase overactive. Such over activity methylates histones more than they should be and thus silences the genes they surround, including so-called tumour-suppressor genes. The PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) tumour suppressor gene affects multiple cellular processes including cell growth, proliferation, and cell migration.  These drugs tend to reactivate the expression of genes that were silenced in cancer cells and  allow them to behave normally.  It is also believed that the the most important time for our epigenome is during development. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p> These drugs alter DNA methylation have a ever lasting effect on epigenome. They can access the solid tumor which was hard to reach to by other chemotherapy methods. In some patients if that drug did not show much effect afterwards when they undergo chemotherapy they showed a better response after induction of these new drugs. Dr Stephen Baylin indicates that these drugs change the tumor cells so that they respond better to the course of standard chemotherapy and only a minute amount is required to trigger the process. He indicates that these epigenetic drug in a small amount can induce changes in epigenetic patterns in cancer cells. Dr Stephen Baylin also coats that “these epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.” The sensitive period is during cell division and childhood development and during pregnancy these drugs have adverse effect and should not be introduced.</p>
