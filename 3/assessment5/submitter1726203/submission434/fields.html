    <div class="field-value"><p class="hg-tinymce-code"><span>DNA methylation of CpG islands has a role in imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin</span><span>. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression.<span>The cancer cells epigenome shows disruption in DNA methylation such as a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation.Disruption of DNA methylation causes genomic instability, deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes.</span> <span>Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remainings of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA. <span>Intergenic regions methylation has a role in maintaining genomic integrity and also silencing of cryptic splice sites. At repetitive elements methylation also contributes to maintaining genomic integrity and silencing and mutation of the repeats to prevent transposition, silencing the repeats to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and methylation to prevent illegitimate recombination.Disruption of DNA methylation occurs in both, intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Hypomethylation and hypermethylation of <span><span><span>repetiive elements and intergenic regions cause genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes, thus leading to cancer. Hypomethylation usually involves repeated DNA sequences, such as long interspersed nuclear elements, whereas hypermethylation involves CpG islands.Mutations in many genes occurs such as genes coding for epigenetic enzymes (for example - <span><span><span><span><span><span>DNMT1)</span></span></span></span></span></span> which maintain methylation. Malignant cells show major disruptions in their DNA methylation patterns. The genes that are susceptible are the genes involved in cell cycle regulation, genes associated with DNA repair (<em>BRCA1, MGMT</em>), apoptosis (<em>DAPK, TMS1</em>), drug resistance, detoxification, differentiation, angiogenesis, and metastasis.Numerous changes in modification patterns have been observed at the level of posttranslational histone modifications, deregulation of lncRNAs, re-positioning of chromatin modifying complexes.<br /></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>Decitabine belongs to  the class of DNA-demethylating agents.</span></span><span><span>It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine rapidly enters cells by a nucleoside-specific transport mechanism;  it is distributed into body fluids and crosses the blood-brain barrier. incorporated into DNA strands targeting aberrant DNA methylation in hematologic malignancies. It is    demethylating or interfering with the methylation of DNA. By demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. </span></span>Decitabine is also a antimetabolite. and nteracts with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.        </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele and CTCF can´t bind and insulate igf2, H19 can´t be expresse beacuse downstream enhancers promote igf2 expression. So igf2 is only expressed at the paternal allele.On the other hand imprint control region is unmethylated on the maternal allele and CTCF binds and insulates igf2 from the downstream enhancers, so enhancers cause H19 expression. Igf2 is not expressed on the maternal allele. In tumors, loss of imprinting occurs, where the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype. Loss of imprinting of H19 on the maternal chromosome, when it occurs, could occur independently or could be influenced by events in the paternal chromosome.Maternal chromosome with a paternal pattern causes methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 is turned on, and H19 is turned off, causing increased cell growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><blockquote>
<p>Unlike other forms of gene regulation epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are  being actively erased. Once erased, they do not return, so it is possible that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.Sensitive periods include active remodelling of the the epigenome (i.e., removal and reestablishment of epigenetic marks). Such periods of development include primordial germ cell development through mature eggs/sperm,  preimplantation and postimplantation periods. Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because alterations or removal of this normal process result in epigenetic abnormalities,particularly aberrant imprinting.</p>
