    <h1>Submission 1994 from Anon (session_user_id: a92437beab0dc7c14cb33b22921c38e8aea6aca8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Reduces amount of DNA methylation.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Decitabine gets incorporated with DNA, and when DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1) come to bind it and methylate it, the drug binds the enzyme which can no longer act. Because DNMT1's action depends on cell division, the drug effects more cancer cells that devide rapidly. Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia).</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>CpG islands are promoters of genes. They are protected from methylation in active genes. Their methylation leads to silencing of the gene (not only in disease, can be part of physiology, e.g. X-inactication).</li>
<li>In cancer, CpG islands and CpG island shores (2kb up/down) are hypermethylated in tumour suppressor genes. The term CIMP stands for CpG Island Methylator Phenotype and describes the phenotype of cancers with methylation of CpG islands for lots of genes. Methylation varies by time, it may progress with the development of cancer.</li>
<li>Silencing of tumour suppressor genes, leads to development of tumour. </li>
</ul><ul><li>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps maintain genomic integrity. These DNA loci are normaly methylated.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Intergenic regions and repeats, are hypomethylated in cancer.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Leads to genomic instability.  This is expressed as activation of repeats and various recombinations (point mutations, translocations, amplification, deletion, copy number variations)</li>
</ul><p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, so usually a change in a cell's/gene's methylation state, will be inherited to all its daughter cells.</li>
<li>Periods when epigenetic reprogramming takes place.</li>
<li>Two are the main periods of development, when epigenetic reprogramming takes place. Early develelopmet, pre-implantation period. And Primordial Germ Cell development (before sperm/egg maturation).</li>
<li>Epigenetic changes can be inherited, so a treatment that alters epigenetic state on cells that are in sensitive periods, can lead to serious genotype and phenotype changes in the next generations of the patient.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The Imprint Control Region (ICR) of H19/Igf2 cluster, is umethylated in the <strong>maternal</strong> allele. CTCF, an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 gene from the downstream enhancers, so it is not expressed. H19 is expressed.</li>
</ul><ul><li>In the <strong>paternal</strong> allele, the ICR is methylated, so the CTCF cannot bind. Now, the methylation spreads to H19 promoter and silences it, and downstream enhancers act on Igf2 and activate it.</li>
</ul><ul><li>With loss of imprint, we have hypermethylation in the maternal allele too. So we get both alleles expressing the Igf2 gene, which leads to double dose of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoting and contributes to Wilm's tumour.</li>
<li>The disruption in imprinting can occur as an early event in lots of tumour types, in pre-neoplastic stage. It can be an early event/sign of tumour genesis.</li>
