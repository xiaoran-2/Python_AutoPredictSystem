    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer typically alters DNA methylation in two ways: locus specific DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation.</p>
<p>CpG islands typically occur at promoters so methylation of CpG islands silences the corresponding genes (in normal functioning this will happen selectively).  Hypermethylation of CpG islands at tumour suppressor genes (as happens in some cancers) can contribute to the development of cancer by reducing the expression of those tumour suppressor genes.  Even if this occurs in only a few cells, the resultant growth can be rapidly selected for leading to tumour formation (because epimutations are mitotically heritable).</p>
<p>Genome-wide hypomethylation can have multiple effects, the most important of which are on repetitive elements and intergenic regions.  In normal functioning, repetitive elements are hypermethylated and densely packed.  This dense packing inhibits recombination at the repetitive elements.   In cancer the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated.  This hypomethylation results in less dense packing of the repetitive elements which increases their recombination.  Because of their repetitive nature this can lead to illegitimate (misaligned) recombination between repeats resulting in genomic instability.  Genomic instability is a characteristic feature of some cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster during normal development the H19 promoter and ICR (CTCF binding site) are imprinted such that they are methylated in the paternal allele, but unmethylated in the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In the paternal allele methylation blocking the CTCF binding site at ICR and blocking the H19 promoter allows the enhancers downstream of H19 to access Igf2 to activate it.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele no methylation at the CTCF binding site at ICR and the H19 promoter means the enhancers downstream of H19 activate the H19 promoter but are blocked by CTCF (an insulating protein bound to the unmethylated CTCF binding site) from activating Igf2.  Because the enhancers can’t activate Igf2 it is not expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour ICR is hypermethylated therefore  Igf2 is overexpressed.  To be more specific, the maternal allele is modified so it is methylated just as the paternal allele is.  Therefore both the maternal and paternal allele are expressing Igf2 as described for the paternal allele above.</p>
<p>The disrupted imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster causes overexpression of Igf2 as described above.  Because Igf2 is a growth promoting gene its overexpression can lead to excessive growth and contribute to tumour development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As a DNA-demethylating agent (a class of epigenetic inhibitor), Decitabine has the effect of reducing DNA methylation.  Because Decitabine reduces DNA methylation it can have an anti-tumour effect on tumours driven by tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation.  This effect occurs because the resultant hypomethylation increases expression of the tumour suppressor gene.   Another example where reducing hypermethylation may be beneficial is countering Igf2 (a growth factor) overexpression in Wilm’s tumour caused by hypermethylation of the ICR in the H19/Igf2 cluster (the mechanism discussed in Q2).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because once established DNA methylation persists through mitotic division (once established epigenetic changes are passed on to daughter cells until actively erased).  I would avoid treating patients (females who could have children) with these drugs during sensitive periods.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are when epigenetic reprogramming is occurring.  Sensitive periods occur during early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because the treatment may interfere with the epigenetic reprogramming of the developing cells and result in epigenetic abnormalities (in the offspring).  Because early embryonic development may be underway before pregnancy has been identified, it is inadvisable to treat females who could become pregnant as well as those who already are pregnant.</p>
<p>Unlike females (whose germ cells are all present at birth), male germ cell development occurs throughout the reproductive years.  I would therefore also recommend against these treatments in males of reproductive age who expect to have children later.</p></div>
