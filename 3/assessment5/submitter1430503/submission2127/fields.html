    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal methylation pattern is the result of adding a methyl group to a CpG pairing. In normal conditions CpG islands containing CpG repetitive sequences can be maintained to be free of methylation in most conditions. However, in cancer conditions, the CpG islands can become hypermethylated leading to silencing of genes. Since there are many genes with CpG islands in their promoter regions (60%) this can cause many broad changes to gene expression. Often the cancer agents have been associated with mutations to methyltransferases which results in broad changes to the epigenomic methylation patterns. The CpG islands in particular have been observed in cancer to create hypermethylation which can result in silencing of tumor suppressing genes. Under normal conditions the methylation of intragenic regions and repetitive sequences are methylated. However, in cancer, there are many changes to DNA methylation: There are unusually high methylation of CpG rich sites (called CIMPs), there is aberrant methylation in CpG island shores (+-2kb).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is a great example of imprinted control region that is affected by differential methylation between the maternal and paternal alleles. The methylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster on the paternal allele affects a CTCF transcription factor binding site, and in the absence of binding the methylation spreads to nearby H19 gene causing causing silencing, and then subsequently allowing distal enhancers to activate the Igf2 gene. On the maternal allele, the H19/Igf2 does not have methylation of the CTCF binding site, and as a result, the distal enhancers activate the H19 gene instead of the Igf2 gene. In the H19/Igf2 cluster, problems in the methylation pattern can lead to Beckwith-witterman’s syndrome and cause childhood tumor growth such as Wilm’s tumor. The imprinting pattern of the maternal allele is disrupted and then it behaves as a paternal allele (resulting in “double-dose” of Igf2 and loss of H19 expression). Only mothers can transmit the disease but fathers can transmit carriers of the disease, and this pedigree is sustained in epidemiology of diseases related to this cluster such as Beckwith-Witterman syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the article "Cancer's epicentre", the major epigenetic changes that underlie different types of cancer are highlighted with some promising treatments that are being developed. One class of drugs that is called Decitabine is a "DNA demethylating agent" that is “used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia”. The demethylation of genes can possibly lead to the desired anti-tumor effects by reactivating tumor-suppressing genes that had been silenced by the aberrant methylation that has been caused by the cancer. After erasing the methylated marks, these changes also are mitotically heritable so future tumor cells will have slowed down growth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic trait that can have enduring effects on the epigenome because by definition, epigenetic traits it can be mitotically or meiotically heritable. In the case of methylation, these patterns are copied using methyltransferase and are even meiotically heritable through the establishment of imprinted control regions. The epigenetics of DNA methylation marks are complex and it goes through several sensitive periods that are crucial for reprogramming of the methylation marks. Thus, a sensitive period is a state where the DNA is especially vulnerable to epigenetic changes. During the sensitive period, the cells undergo reprogramming to remove methylation marks and then reestablish them. This happens first in the blastocyst where the methylation is passively and actively removed for the maternal and paternal alleles respectively. The second is during primordial germ cell development where there is active demethylation of DNA. Treating patients during sensitive periods is not advisable since these periods have very precise methods for establishing imprinted control regions and are vulnerable to environmental effects,.and because malformed imprinted control regions can result in diseases like Beckwith-Witterman syndrome.</p></div>
