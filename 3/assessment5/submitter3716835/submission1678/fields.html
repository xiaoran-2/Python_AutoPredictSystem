    <div class="field-value"><p>Most diseases change something in the human body when they occur, be it the immune system, the cells etc. Cancer, among other things, changes our bodies’ DNA-methylation. One of these instances is at the CpG-islands. Normally, CpG-islands are a group of un-methylated CpGs, which are found at (but not exclusive to) the promoters of tumor suppressors. In cancer, these CpG islands become hyper-methylated, which means that they become more methylated than they should and are thus silenced. Because they are silenced, the tumor suppressor whose promoter they are at also becomes silenced which means that they cannot make sure that tumors don’t develop in the cells.</p>
<p>Another one of the instances in which cancer changes the DNA-methylation is in the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated and thus kept silent and non-expressed. In cancer, unlike the CpG islands who become hyper-methylated, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements lose their methylation – they become hypo-methylated. Repetitive elements are repeats (essentially copies) of a gene that are methylated to prevent them from jumping across the genome and insert themselves somewhere in it and disrupting other genes. Based on this description, it is clear that without methylation of these repetitive elements, you get genomic instability.</p>
<p>There are different ways that this genomic instability can show itself. For example, you can get insertions of a chromosome which means that you get more of a chromosome than in a normal cell, sometimes you get whole copies of them. You can get deletions of a chromosome, which means that you get less of a chromosome than in a normal cell. You could also get reciprocal translocation which means that one part of a chromosome may be written over to another, completely different one and vice versa.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Only one of the two alleles that you inherited from your mother and father is expressed in your cells, the other is imprinted. However, you can have both alleles expressed and survive, but they must be paternal and maternal as any other possible combination results in failure of embryo vitality. The reason for this is because the paternal and maternal alleles differ epigenetically in a normal cell.</p>
<p>The maternal allele has its ICR (imprint control region) un-methylated, this results in the insulator protein CTCF binding to the ICR and protecting the Igf2-cluster from downstream enhancers acting on it. Because Igf2 is closed off, the enhancers instead target the H19-cluster and promote its expression. On the paternal allele on the other hand, has its ICR methylated which means that CTCF cannot bind to it. Thus, downstream enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and promote its expression.</p>
<p>There are ways that the imprinting of the different clusters can be disrupted and that causes problems. For example, in Wilm’s Tumor, there is hyper-methylation of the ICRs on both alleles which leads to a loss of Cdkn1c which is a tumor suppressor and up-regulation of Igf2 which has oncogenes, two things that lead to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As of now, there are a slew of different types of drugs developed to help treat different diseases (most notably, cancer) that target epigenetic processes in the human body. There are many examples, but most of the ones presented in the article have to do with DNA-methylation. Decitabine is one of these DNA-methylation inhibitors.</p>
<p>Sold as Dacogen, Decitabine can be used to treat myleodysplastic syndrome (MDS), the precursor to acute myleogenous leukemia. As an inhibitor, Decitabine is supposed to stop DNA-methylation from continuing to happen, or at least decrease the rate at which it happens. The way that this can be helped to treat cancer is because in said disease, the regulating factor that makes sure tumors don’t develop, tumor-suppressors, are heavily methylated and thus rendered useless. If the DNA-methylation were to go away or decrease from these, they could once again regulate and make sure that tumors don’t develop.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. This means that alterations in the epi-genome of one cell will be passed on to its daughter cells which will pass it on to their daughter cells and so forth; this obviously includes DNA-methylation as well. Thus, changed DNA-methylation in cancer would spread fast as cancer cells divide very rapidly. However, even though this is a good way to cure diseases, there are some things which you should be cautious of, regarding these methods.</p>
<p>It would be best to avoid getting treated with these drugs during a sensitive period. A sensitive period is a time frame in which the environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup, like when epigenetic reprogramming is happening. One of these periods is the period of primordial germ-cell development to the production of the eggs and sperm. Another period is the pre-implantation period and the post-implantation period of the embryo.</p>
<p>Due to trans-generational epigenetic inheritance, you will inherit a phenotype from your parent or grandparent passed through because of an epigenetic change. If this epigenetic change is an increase of DNA-methylation, it is very likely that you will end up with heavy DNA-methylation throughout your body which causes serious complications.</p></div>
