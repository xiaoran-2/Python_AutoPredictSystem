    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one form of epigenetic modification of the genome, and is carried out by a class of enzymes called DNA methyl-transferases. DNA methylation occurs on cytosine residues which are adjacent to guanine residues (CpG's) which can either be clustered together (CpG islands) or are part of repetitive elements or found in intergenic regions.</p>
<p>CpG islands are often located in the promoter region of genes and are usually unmethylated. DNA methylation at these islands allows binding of methylated CpG binding proteins which can further recruit other factors which lead to condensed chromatin, or directly prevents transcription factors from binding to the promoter region. These two mechanisms result in silencing of the associated downstream gene. </p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions is thought to silence cryptic start codons and splice site, while DNA methylation in repetitive elements silences repeats minimising transpostion, prevents transcriptonal interference from strong promoters, and illegitimate recombinations. As such DNA methylation in these two regions helps maintain genomic integrity.</p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG islands are usually unmethylated and intergenic and repeat regions are usually methylated. However in cancer cells, the reverse is true. This disruption of the normal methylation pattern can result in the silencing of tumor suppresors due to hypermethylation of their promoters and/or the activation of oncogenes due to hypomethylation of their promoters. Furthermore, hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions can lead to genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethyating agent and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. Decitabine acts by incorporating into the DNA and irreverasbly binding to DNMT1, preventing which results in lack of maintenace of DNA mthylation marks throughout cell devision. this results in dilution of the DNA methylation state, leading to generalised hypomethylation of the tumor cell genome and thus produces widespread genomic instability of the tumour cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable form of epigenetic modifcation brought about by the action of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) maintaining the epigenetic state by methylating the complimentary strand of hemimethylated DNA. In this way, a change in DNA methylation can endure even after cessation of drug treatment. A sensitive period is a time during development when the genome of an individual us undergoing epigenetic modification. These times are early development when the blastocyst is formed, and a later part of fetal development when primordial germ cells are forming within the fetus. Treating patients during these periods would be inadvisable, since there could be lasting effects up to three generations ahead. For example, during the latter period of fetal development when primordial germ cells are beginning to form, any treatment would affect the epigenetic marks of the mother, her fetus and the fetus' primordial germ cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele, while the maternal allele is unmethylated indicating that this cluster is paternally imprinted. This results in expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele only and not the maternal allele.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour is a childhood tumour found in the kidneys which is commonly observed in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). In BWS, the methylation pattern of the HG19/Igf2 cluster on the maternal allele becomes identical to that on the paternal allele, which results in a double dose of Igf2 expression. Since imprinting occurs during the formation of primordial germ cells, an affected man cannot pass the disease onto his children since all his sperm would have paternal imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster. However, an affected woman has a 50% chance of passing the disease onto her children sincer her oocytes can have either the normal maternal imprinting, or the abnormal imprinting which resembles paternal imprinting at the H19/IGF2 locus. As such, BWS has parent of origin inheritance in that it is passed on through the mother but not the father.</p></div>
