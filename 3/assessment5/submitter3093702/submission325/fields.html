    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Methylation of DNA at CpG islands is a enzyme-induced modification to DNA structure without alteration of the specific sequence of the base pairs responsible for encoding the genome. DNA methylation can both directly inhibit the expression of genes and also increase the probability that affected genes undergo a mutational event. Although DNA methylation plays an essential role in normal biologic processes, distinct and abnormal patterns of DNA methylation of CpG islands are observed in cancers. In particular, there has been increased documentation that methylation of the promoter regions of several genes, including known tumor suppressor genes, results in the subsequent failure to express their functional proteins and also in unmethylated regions in the downstream regions of the genes, which is contrary to that found in normal cells.<span> The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is that there is suppression of the cellular overgrowth and hence limited secretion of cellular growth proteins. But in cancer cells, <span>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is found to be disrupted, and hence there is no control for the growth of cells, leading to the increased growth of cancer cell and hence metastasis. This d<span>isruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes by suppression of cellular growth as mentioned earlier, in normal cells than in cancer cells.</span></span></span> Consequently, DNA methylation may represent an early and fundamental step in the pathway by which normal tissue undergoes neoplastic transformation.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is the process in which one genome of the two parents, silenced from expressing a specific protein, as in the case of <span>H19/Igf2 cluster. When there is disruption in imprinting, there is the possibility that both the genomes, maternal and paternal, would be expressed leading to the overproduction of specific proteins. For example: the disruption of genomic imprinting leading to Wilm's tumour, the cause of an early age kidney cancer, as stated in the lecture. In this case, <span>the methylation pattern of the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated causing the enhancers downstream to activate Igf2, which is hence expressed. But in the case of <span>the methylation pattern of the maternal allele, CTCF binds to the imprint control region which makes the enhancers activate the H19, leaving behind the Igf2 which remains silenced. I<span>n Wilm’s tumour, as stated earlier, the imprint control region of the maternal allele is also methylated, due to the absence of CTCF or the loss of imprinting, hence the enhancers of both the maternal and the paternal alleles activates the Igf2 producing double dosage of Igf2 which leads to Wilm's tumour. As mentioned above, <span>disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes It  to the disease. </span></span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is <span>an epigenetic drug that inhibits DNA methylation, is currently used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which is progressed to AML. It belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors, the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. It is a nucleoside analog, and it gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication and when the DNA methyl transferase comes to bind it the DNA MT1 binds the nucleotide, and thus the Decitabine binds to the DNA methyl transferase which could no longer be released. It thus acts as an anti-replicative drug on the cancer cells. Hence, Decitabine acts as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, acts as anti-tumour drugs by preventing them from replicating more, unless the dosage of usage is very low.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment, by producing irreversible changes in the epigenetic marks. By altering DNA methylation, can have enduring effects on the epigenome. This is because of the fact that DNA methylation is maintained and balanced by various factors which often tend to preserve the epigenetic marks that are laid down. This is especially true during the sensitive periods of the prenatal life. Sensitive period, which is also known as the critical period, in which the epigenetic changes are most likely to occur. Sensitive periods of development are mostly during the prenatal period of birth. Hence, treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisible because these changes may affect epigenetic modifications permanently and could lead to irreversibilities on treatment with drugs.</p></div>
