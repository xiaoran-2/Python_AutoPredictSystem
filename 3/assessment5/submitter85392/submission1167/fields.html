    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands often occur at gene promotors and are mostly not methylated. However, if they are, this will silence the gene because it can form a repressive chromatin structure (the DNA is more densely packaged and harder to transcribe) or can prohibit transcription factor binding. In cancer, there is hypermethylation of the CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes. This results in the silencing of those genes, so the tumour does not get suppressed as should happen. There can also be hypomethylation of the promotors of oncogenes, resulting in unrestricted growth because the genes are not silenced as they should be.</p>
<p>In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. This helps to maintain the genomic integrity, for example by avoiding translocations because the DNA is more densely packed. In cancer, there is genome-wide hypomethylation. This lack of methylation results in genomic instabilty when it occurs at repeats or intergenic intervals, because it can cause activation of repeats and illegitimate recombinations between repeats.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated. This blocks the CTCF binding and results in spreading of the methylation, which silences the H19 promotor. The enhancers further downstream will be able to access Igf2 and activate it.</p>
<p>In contrast, on the maternal allele, the imprint control region is demethylated. In this case, CTCF will be able to bind and the H19 promotor will not be silenced. The enhancers won't be able to reach Igf2 (because of CTCF) so this will not be expressed and they will instead enhance the H19 gene.</p>
<p>When there is a mutation or deletion that causes the lose of imprinting, the maternal allele will behave like a paternal allele. This results in no H19 expression and too much Igf2 expression. Igf2 is an oncogene and by overexpressing it, there will be tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. This means that it will remove DNA methylation. DNA methylation can cause tumours by silincing tumour repressor genes. If decitabine is able to remove the methylation at the CpG islands on the promotors of these genes, the tumour repressor genes can be activated again, which of course will have an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, due to features of DNMT1. This means that when cells divide, the methylation of the parent cell will be adopted by the new cells. As such, these effects can last a lifetime.</p>
<p>In sensitive periods, epigenetic reprogramming happens. This means that, except for repeats, the DNA methylation is removed and then added again. This happens when forming the primordial germ cells to form the gametes (the reprogramming is only completely finished when the gametes are formed), and also in the embryonic development. During the embryonic development, the imprint regions will not be demethylated.</p>
<p>Influences on the epigenetic programming during these sensitive periods can have effects that last multiple generations. As long as we do not understand the exact machinery of all the epigenetic marks and all the possible side effects of such treatments, it would be very inadvisable to create effects that might have such a big influence, not only on your own life, but also on that of your children and grandchildren.</p></div>
