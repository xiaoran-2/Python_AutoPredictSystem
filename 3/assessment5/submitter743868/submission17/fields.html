    <div class="field-value"><p>              </p>
<p>In normal cells DNA methylation of CpG islands blocks intergenic areas between genes, repetitive regions, and the introns within genes. This protects the chromosome form insertion of cryptic promoters from transposons. The insertion of a cryptic promoter near a normal promoter or an intron can disrupt the promoter by up regulating the expression of the gene. On the other hand there’s less methylation of promoters that contain CpG islands in normal cells. Cancer can result in hypermethylation of these promoters. This hypermethylation can cause a tumor suppresser gene to be turn off leading to uncontrolled cell growth.</p>
<p> In cancer hypomethylation occurs in the intragenic regions causing genomic instability. Lack of methylation in these regions can lead the tightly packed heterochromatin, where transcription isn’t occurring, to be converted to the open euchromatin which makes genes more available for transcription. The lack of methylation in these regions can result in chromosomal abnormalities like deletions, insertions, and illegitimate cross-overs between none pairing chromosomes. In normal cells methylation of CpG islands protects the chromosome in non-coding areas.</p>
<p> The lack of methylation in the intergenic regions can cause activation of transposition and repeats, which insert themselves in other regions leading to mutations.  This instability can result in -proto-oncogenes genes that are normality turned off to be expressed and genes that suppress growth to be turned off. An example is myc a transcription factor for many genes. It is widely found and many cancers. Its uncontrolled expression can result many genes being turned on leading to unregulated cell growth. Some examples of other hypermethylated genes seen in cancer are BRCA1 and 2 which are over expressed in breast and ovarian cancer. This would support the Kudson Hypothesis that cancer is the result of multiple mutations to the genetic code. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Methylation of DNA is a mitotically inherited change in the epigenome. The methylation pattern can turn off genes in somatic cells allowing only genes that are characteristic for that cell to be transcribed. This change would spread among new cells and progeny cells.  This is how a somatic cell retains its phenotype throughout a person’s life span.</p>
<p> Because cancer cells in replicate faster than normal cells changes would spread faster among cancer cells. Epigenetic drugs could alter the cancerous methylation state of the cell rendering them more sensitive to chemotherapeutic drugs.  Taking the drugs during sensitive periods could pose a problem. A sensitive period is when epigenetic controls that holds cells in their terminal differentiated state are removed allowing the cells to become pluripotent, meaning they give rise to any somatic cell type. This occurs during two phases of life. Fi rst is fertilization, formation of the zygote, and embryogenesis. The next occurs during gamete formation of sex cells. Cancer treatments for patients wishing to conceive would be putting the embryo at risk to permanent epigenetic changes. This would occur at fertilization and embryogenesis when oocytes are formed up to about 20 weeks, in males from puberty till death.     </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Some genes are expressed from both alleles; other genes are only expressed from one chromosomal allele termed monoallelic gene expression. Epigenetic control can prevent genes expression through an imprinting control region (ICR). The ICR can transcribe a long noncoding RNA that acts in cis fashion to block RNA polymerase II from transcribing genes. However, in monoallelic gene expression the ICR is methylated leading to one allele being turn on and one allele being turned off.</p>
<p>In normal cells an ICR called H19 is methylated only on the parental allele allowing transcription of the growth factor IgF2. When not methylated, as on the maternal allele, H19 is expressed blocking a series of enhancers that act  to turn on IgF2 by removing the blocker CTCF, a protein that binds the chromatin structure more tightly to repress genes.  In the childhood kidney tumor, Wilm’s disease, both chromosomes in the H19 region are methylated. This leads to the over expression of the growth hormone IgF2.</p>
<p>An early event before cells become cancerous is uncontrolled growth called neoplasm. In many neoplastic states, where cells are over growing, is due to the methylation of imprinting control regions leading to disruption of epigenetic control.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs that are small molecules that act as antimetabolites binding and blocking enzymes involved in epigenetic control of gene expression. These enzymes can add or remove methyl or acetyl groups to histones and DNA. Some block the DNA methyl transferases like Decitabine which blocks the DNA methyltransferases leading to hypomethylation of DNA. The drug acts on a blood disorder called myelodysplastic syndromes which can lead to Acute Myeloid leukemia.</p>
<p>In cancer hypermethylation in the epigenome can turn off genes responsible for regulating cell growth by methylating CpG islands found within most promoters. These proto-oncogenes are often transcription factors that control gene expression. Genes responsible for cell growth that go unchecked can lead to neoplasm and cancer.  Decitabine can block this hypermethylation by blocking the enzyme that methylates the DNA. However, lack of methylation between genes and in repetitive sequences can lead to genomic instability leading to cancer.</p>
