    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation is a stable inactive epigenetic mark that is mitotoically inheritable, varies within cell types, and essential for cellular viability. DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B) lay down methylation in <em>de novo</em> fashion almost exclusively at CpG sites. CpG methylation is found genome wide, except to a much lesser degree at CpG islands.</p>
<p>When methylation of CpG islands occurs it is primarily associated with gene promoters and synonymous with silencing of genes normally activated by these gene specific promoters during cell division. The silencing is thought to be primarily the result of condensation of chromatin caused by the binding of methylated CpG binding proteins (MecP1 and MecP2) which leads to an alteration in transcription.</p>
<p>Being primarily unmethylated, CpG island methylation in normal cells is not likely to affect tumor suppressor genes thus maintaining  inhibition of  tumor growth and a disease free state. With cancer, CpG methylation decreases genome wide, yet increases at CpG islands, including sites associated with tumor suppressor genes. The cause of this opposing  methylation pattern has yet to be determined. But, because methylation is mitotically heritable, this leads to a locking-in of the silencing of the tumor supression gene(s), thus allowing tumor cells to have a competitive edge over surrounding cells, divide more frequently, die less, and become more invasive leading to tumor growth and disease/cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is thought to promote genomic stability by: silencing repeats to prevent mutagenic transposition and avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters; preventing mutation of repeats (deletions/insertions) that would lead to transpositions; preventing illegitimate recombination/translocation between chromosomes; and preventing whole chromosome duplication. With cancer/disease, intergenic regions and repetitive elements demonstrate hypomethylation, which leads to genomic instability and harmful mutagenesis/tumor growth caused by these previously suppressed mutagenic processes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypo/hypermethylation at imprint control regions (ICRs) leads to the loss or over expression of growth promoting or tumor suppressing  genes within gene clusters. This can lead to disease (Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome) or tumor growth (Wilm's tumor). When looking at the Igf2/H19 gene cluster, you have a maternal allele that has an unmethylated ICR that binds to CTCF, which suppresses the expression of Igf2 (growth promoter) while promoting expression of H19 (tumor suppressor), with the help of strong downstream enhancers. The ICR in the paternal allele is normally methylated which suppresses expression of H19, but promotes expression of Igf2 with the help of the same enhancers. So with normal gene expression from both parental alleles you have a balance between growth promotion and growth suppression.</p>
<p>Mutations/deletions, uniparental disomy, or epigentic disruption in the ICR within a gene clusters can set the stage for disease. If the ICR in the Igf2/H19 gene cluster in the maternal allele becomes methylated, it functions like the paternal allele. This creates a double dosing effect of the growth promoting  Igf2 gene and complete suppression of the growth suppressor gene H19, leading to tumor growth such as with Wilm's tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of antineoplastic drugs known as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). It appears that haematologic malignancies that are dependent on tumor suppressor gene/ CpG island hypermethylation, such as myelodysplatic syndrome, are influenced by both epigenetic alterations and apoptosis induction which can be reversed using DNMTi. These drugs reactivate epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes<em> in vitro</em>, but their exact mode of action in patients has yet to be completely defined.</p>
<p>Decitabine exerts its antineoplastic affect after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA during replication. There it inhibits DNMT, thus causing hypomethylation of DNA and apoptotic cell death in rapidly dividing neoplastic cells. DNA hypomethylation is achieved with DNMTi at concentrations well below those that significantly inhibit DNA synthesis genome wide.Therefore promoting restoration of function to genes associated with control of normal hematologic cellular differentiation and proliferation, and reducing disease without highly toxic side-effects. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Safety issues surrounding epigenetic therapy have been addressed and therapeutic protocals approved in older adult populations. Less is known of their long term effect when administered during more sensitive periods of development/rapid cell growth such as pregnancy, early childhood, and puberty, as long-term studies have not been established.</p>
<p>The most sensitive periods for epigenetic reprogramming are during the clearing and resetting of epigenetic markers that occurs during primordial germ cell development through egg/sperm maturation and during the pre-implantation and post-implantation periods. As we know, changes in DNA methylation at CpG islands, intergenic regions, and repetitive elements can cause genomic instability leading to permanent mutations such as deletions, insertions, duplication of whole chromosomes, or translocations between chromosomes. Epigenetic drugs that change methylation patterns may also cause similar instability and mutations that may not be evident at time of therapy or may have transgenerational effects, taking years to become fully exposed or not evident till additional epigenetic factors come into play. Thus, until long term studies of the effects of epigenetic therapy during these sensitive periods dismiss safety concerns, one would be advised to avoid treating patients with these drugs during pregnancy, early childhood, and adolescence. </p></div>
