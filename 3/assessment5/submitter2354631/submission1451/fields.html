    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CPG islands occur in high frequency near start sequences promoters of genes. Methylation of CPG islands occurs when a methyl group binds to cytosine nucleotides, an event that is negatively correlated with gene expression. Although methylation of CPG islands is rare in normal circumstances, it is more commonly found in cancerous cells. DNA methylation is preserved in mitosis, and is therefore stable throughout adult life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When normal patterns of CPG methylation are disrupted, an epimutation occurs. Aberrant hypomethylation of CPG islands leads to the silencing of genes, and where those genes are associated with growth suppression, it is strongly correlated with the development of hyperplasia and neoplasia. It remains unclear whether epimutation precedes or results from genetic mutation, and this may differ by cell/tumour type. Because uncontrolled growth and reproduction throughout the body is a key feature of tumours, CPG island methylation has been seen as an important feature in the metastatic nature of cancer.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions plays a key role in cell differentiation, x inactivation and genetic imprinting. In all of these cases, DNA methylation is negatively correlated with gene expression and transcritption. A highly stable form of DNA methylation silences repetitive elements, which would be harmful if actively transcribed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In general, cancer is negatively correlated with DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In other words, the Methylation that silences expression of harmful genes, and prevents the over expression of other genes is reduced in cancerous cells. As a result, oncogenes are more actively transcribed.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>While hypomethylation of CPG islands is associated with the silencing of important growth supressor genes, the effect of DNA hypomethylation in the gene body, and repetitive elements leads to the activation of growth promoting genes, and other oncogenes that prolong cell life. In both cases, these changes lead to cells which are more likely to reproduce and persist, resyulting in cell proliferation and tumorogenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes have parent of origin epigenetic marks that allow only one allele to be expressed. These epigenetic marks consist of  DNA methylation of the Imprint Control Region (ICR) on each allele. Methylation ICRs can be associated with either promotion or suppression, and vary with cell type.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted, methylation of the paternal ICR blocks binding of CTCF, allowing downstream enhancers to bind upstream in a preferred loop to upstream cgF2. As a result, methylation of the paternal ICR results in upregulation of Igf2.  In contrast, the unmethylated ICR at the maternal allele allows binding of CTC factor, this blocks the preferred loop, and the enhancers bind instead to downstream H19; this silences expression of cgF2 at the maternal allele (H19 is also blocked in the paternal allele when DNA methylation spreads from paternal ICR). In summary, methylation of the paternal ICR allows imprinted expression of the paternal allele, with promotion of cgF2, while maternal expression remains silenced.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is significant for cancer because either epigenetic disrutption or chromosomal disorders (i.e. disomy) can result in two paternal type alleles, and the subsequent up regulation of Igf2, an oncogene associated with cell growth, and down-regulation of cdKnlc, a tumour suppressor gene. The clinical outcome of this event is known as Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation occurs when a methyl group binds to DNA nucleotides, a process that is in general negatively correlated which transcription. Cancer is negatively correlated with methylation in general, but positively correlated with methylation at CPG islands and Impritn Control Regions (ICRs). Epimutation of  DNA methylation at specific loci, such asCPG islands and shores, and Imprint control regions, can lead to the promotion of growth factors and the silencing of tumour suppressor genes.</p>
<p> Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent; it inhibits the DNA methylation process. As a result, Decitabine has been used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which are diseases of the bone marrow that are often precursors of leukemia. It is thought that hypomethylating agents like decitabine reduce tumour growth by preventing methylation of those areas which promote uncontrolled cell growth and reproduction. By preventing further tumour growth, it provides a useful adjunct to chemotherapy agents.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is preserved in mitosis, as one methyl group is preserved in each parent DNA strand, and another methyl group is added to each daughter strand. As a result, DNA methylation remains stable throughout the life of the cell, with the exception of two periods in the life cycle (early embyogenesis and primordial germ cell development). These two periods are known as the sensitive period, as at this point most epigenetic marks (except those controlling repetitive elements and imprinted genes) are removed, and the epigenome is effectively reset, preventing any harmful heredity of environmental insults.</p>
<p>Dr. Baylin's treatment involved histone deacetylene inhibitors (HDIs). HDIs are  drugs that affect the histone remodelling - differentially changing the density of chromatin packaging and the expression of genes. Drugs that affect the epigenome would be dangerous during sensitive periods because it would be impossible to taget the drugs towards certain areas of the epigenome - DNA methylation and histone acetylation would be affected wholesale. Furthermore, these sensitive periods cover the two most developmetally sensitive periods, in which small changes in the epigenome have been shown to have significant effects on survival; changes in germ cells can effect offspring.</p></div>
