    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modifications to the genome, including methylation and acetylation, act to create a state of relative expression of various genes.  Generally, DNA methylation relates to the silencing of the expression while acetylation fascilitates expression of the underlying gentic segment where the chemical residue is bonded.  In the case of CpG (Cytosine phosphodiester Guanine) islands, which consist of CpG base pair groupings at minimum 200 kb long, methylation is typically underrepresented relating to expression of adjacent genes [1]. A commonality among tumor cells is a genome-wide hypomethylation of intergenic CpGs and hypermethylation of CpG islands and island shores, corresponding to the approximately 2 kb adjacent segment of genome up or downstream of CGIs [2].  These aberrations from typical DNA epigenetic state can lead to silencing of tumor-suppressor genes, which normally act as a line of defense by causing potentially cancerous cells to undergo active cell death or apoptosis [3].  Another typical epigenetic cause of cancer would be the hypomethylation of oncogenetic regions which would potentiate the promotion of cancerous cell growth.  All of these effects in concert could also relate to genomic instability which would cause a harmful and possibly oncogenetic results during normal cell division during a lifetime.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Within the context of healthy genetic imprinting, parentally associated epigenetic markers are retained on alleles through the period of epigenetic reprogramming during early embryonic development.  In particular, the gene cluster encoding for H19/Igf2 has variable methylation between maternal and paternal alleles in order to compensate for relative protein dosage.  On the maternal allele, CTCF (transcriptional repressor) binds to an imprint control region (ICR) and acts as an insulating element so that upstream enhancers can promote the expression of H19.  On the paternal allele, methylation of the ICR allows for the downstream enhancers to promote the expression of Igf2. </p>
<p>When a loss of imprinting occurs in relation to the maternal allele, CTCF is unable to bind to its normal substrate due to ICR methylation. Here the H19 promoter is silenced so that Igf2 is enhanced, thus it is expressed on both parental alleles.  As Igf2 is a growth promoting protein, the double dosage can effectively lead to tumor promotion in tissues, more specifically Wilm’s tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As new light is shed on the etiology of cancerous cells and tissues, epigenetic causes are being investigated with some promising results.  As an example, some common types of lymphomas have been found to be the result of mutations to enzyme named EZH2, which when dysfunctional can lead to DNA histone hypermethylation (H3K27).  Under these circumstances, there can occur an effective silencing of tumor-suppressor genes, thus allowing oncogenesis.  Decitabine, which functions as a DNA-demethylating agent or more specifically a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, is prohibitive of cancer cell development by counteracting the silencing of tumor-suppressing genes.  This essentially allows the expression of previously silenced tumor-suppressor proteins.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A sensitive period, in genetics, relates to the developmental state in which genetic reprogramming has removed a majority of epigenetic marks in order to enable cell totipotency for embryonic development.  Once cells differentiate into specific tissues, epigenetic states are maintained through mitotic heritability, thus ensuring proliferation of relative cell types.  There are two different stages of epigenetic reprogramming, or genome-wide hypomethylation, which includes early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development.  Treatments that seek to alter aberrant epigenetic markers would potentially have their therapeutic effects by sustaining the “fixed” or more epigenetically stable state of all clonal cells.  This could take the form of establishing a previously absent protein, knocking down an overabundant protein or altering a variety of other deviated biological processes.  As epigenetic treatments would be sustained throughout all clonal cells, establishing these marks during a sensitive period would have effects on primordial germ cells in patients.  This could alter epigenetic markers for would-be offspring of patients which could potentially have harmful effects in relation to tissue specific genes as well as imprinted genes [1].</p>
