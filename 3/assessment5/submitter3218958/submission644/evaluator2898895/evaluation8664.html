    <div class="field-value">16 of 34 marks from me. Sorry, but your answers were too summarised! The word limit was about 150 to 200 for each question so I imagine maybe you were on a rush?
Sadly you left out important pieces of information like the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, CTCF, how are IGF2 and H19 are related, Decitabine class of drug and hence how it does exerts its effect. Regarding the sensitive periods, you were close but they actually are early embryonic development (early development would include up to childhood!) and 'gamete cell line' development (this also occurs during the embryo and foetal stage! When these cells migrate to what will later on become the gonads. The gamete producing phase occurs after puberty.).
