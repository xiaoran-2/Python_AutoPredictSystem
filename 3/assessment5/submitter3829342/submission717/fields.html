    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of CpG islands which are usually located at the promoter regions can bring about silencing of functional genes like tumor supressor genes. A methylated gene can be bound by Mecp1 and 2 that recruit other factors to condense the chromatin and silence the gene. But in case of cancer cells hypermethylation of CpG islands occurs and this rate increases by progression of cancer. Moreover if methylation occurs at tumor supressor gene, the gene gets silenced which may result in cancer only if the other copy of the gene is defected. On the other hand intergenic regions and repetitive elements whose methylation maintains genomic stability and integrity, get hypomethylated in cancer cells. Consequently, illigimate recombination between repeats and their transposition may happen as a result of activation of promoters and activation of some genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration in DNA methylation can effect imprinted gene expression directly. For instance, Igf2 expression in H19 cluster. when imprinted control region on paternal gene is methylated, CTCF cannot bind and hence enhancers act on Igf2 to get it expressed from paternal side hence producing a single dose of Igf2.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, hypermethylation of imprint control region on maternal allele can cause expression of Igf2 from both paternal and maternal allele that results in production of Igf2 (a growth promoting factor) in double dose and leads to Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-Demethylating agent and it is used in epigenetic therapy. Decitabine helps in actively erasing the epigenetic changes (methylation of DNA in cancer cells) so that they do not pass on to daughter cells during cell devision and helps to<span> stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When epigenetic changes get erased by DNA methylation drugs,they do not pass on to daughter cells by cell devision. so even if the drug supply is stopped, they can have enduring effect on the patient.</p>
<p>Primordial and germ cell developement and early embryonic developement are sensitive periods of developement. They are periods of developement when epigenetic reprograming is being done, so they are more susceptible to environmental signals, hence its not advisable to treat patients at these peroiods because it may cause high offspring syndrome if epigenetic reprogramming does not happen properly and imprinted gene expression gets defected ( ICRs do not get a chance to reset) .</p></div>
