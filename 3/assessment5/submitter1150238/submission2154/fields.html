    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found at the promoters of genes - where transcription factors bind. DNA methylation at CpG islands shuts down this binding, and in doing so silences gene expression. DNA methylation serves an important purpose. Differentiated cells have specific functions, like neurons, muscle cells, T-Cells, blood cells etc. DNA methylation shuts down genes whose function is not required in that cell. DNA methylation is also vital in X-chromosome inactivation.<br /><br />Tumor suppressor genes control the growth/spread/tumorigenesis of cancer. Excessive CpG methylation silences their expression. CpG island hypermethylation pays a role in retinoblastoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer and gliomas.<br /><br />Cancer can metastasize faster when the tumor suppressor genes are silenced. The type of cancer depends on the cells where CGIs were hypermethylated. Their identity can be found by genome-wide DNA methylation studies. DNA hypermethylation biomarkers are more sensitive to detection.<br /><br />In normal cells, it is important to silence repeats. In mammals DNMT3a and DNMT3b are methyltransferases that silence repeats de novo (at birth). DNMT1 maintains methylation. Promoters are binding sites for transcription factors that enable expression of the gene. Oncogenes should have their CpG-poor promoters methylated to keep them inactive.<br /><br />In cancer, intergenic regions and repeats are hypo(under)methylated. Repeats can participate in illegitimate recombination - leading to genomic instability. Furthermore, in the intergenic region, oncogenes can become active by being hypomethylated.<br /><br />Mutations in DNMT3B result in ICF syndrome, and its associated genomic instability.<br />R-RAS is a gastric cancer that arises from the hypomethylation of CpG-poor promoters.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the imprint control region (ICR) both DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation can cause different types of cancer. The H19/lgf2 cluster is found on Chromosome 11. <br /><br />In the normal paternal allele, H19 is deactivated by methylation of the CTCF insulator protein and the H19 promoter too. Downstream enhancers can activate the lgf2 ocogene. But in this imprinting the maternal allele is chosen.<br /><br />In the maternal allele, H19 is active, and the CTCF insulator protein prevents the enhancers from activating the oncogene, lgf2. So lgf2 is not expressed.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, DNA methylation of the ICR blocks binding of CTCF on the maternal allele too. The DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter and silences it. The enhancers can now activate lgf2 on the maternal allele. Upregulation of this lgf2 (growth promoting) oncogene leads to the Wilm's tumor. The maternal allele loses the imprinting. It becomes similar to the paternal allele (called uniparental disomy).<br /><br />The Wilm's tumor is caused by overexpression of the lgf2 oncogene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancers are genetic or epigenetic. They are created and spread by malfunctioning genes. But, it is difficult to repair genetic mutations in DNA. However, there is a solution. Genes are regulated. It is possible to turn genes on and off. And this on/off switch can be controlled chemically, that is, with drug treatment. This is the epigenetic solution to control a few cancers.<br /><br />Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Tumor suppressor genes gets silenced by DNA-methylation at CpG Islands. This enhances tumorigenesis (uncontrolled growth of cancer) Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It works by inhibiting DNA-methyltransferase. Lowering the DNA-methylation re-activates tumor-suppressor genes leading to an anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Daughter cells (and future generations) will also have this epigenetic mark. Epigenetic marks alter the function of genes without altering the underlying DNA sequence. But these marks can be reset during a period in early life by epigenetic reprogramming. This period, during which there is a heightened sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms, is called the sensitive period.<br /><br />There are two sensitive periods. In the pre-implantation early development state, both maternal and paternal genomes get demethylated. In the first sensitive period, they get methylated again, while the blastocyst develops into the epiblast. Later, in the second primordial germ cell state, another phase of epigenetic reprogramming happens during sexual identity setting.<br /><br />Alterations or removal of the normal process result in epigenetic abnormalities, <br />particularly aberrant imprinting. That is why it is inadvisable to treat patients during the sensitive periods.</p></div>
