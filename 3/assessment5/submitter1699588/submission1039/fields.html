    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are commonly found in gene promoters and are normally protected from methylation, however when they are methylated in a normal cell it occurs to silence the gene the promoter controls.  In cancer, there is a much higher incidence of DNA methylation (hypermethylation) at CpG islands than in normal cells. This results in gene siliencing and this contributes to disease because in many cases the genes that are silenced are tumor suppressor genes.  Silencing of these tumor suppressor genes then results in the faster growth of the cancer cells.</p>
<p>Normally DNA is highly methylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, this helps maintain genome stability.  In cancer, there is hypomethylation of these regions.  This reduction in DNA methylation at these regions results in greater genomic instability.  These intergenic regions and repetitive elements often contain transposons that when active cause recombination that disrupts the genome by disrupting genes that are normally active and activating genes that are normally silenced as well as resulting in duplications, deletions, inversions and translocations of sections of chromosomes.  All of these changes to chromosome structure can contribute to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer can disrupt imprint control regions changing the normal monoallelic gene expression seen in these regions.  This can result in a double dose of growth promoting gene expression or silencing of tumor suppresor genes.  An example of this is the Igf2/H19 cluster.  </p>
<p>In normal cells the imprint control region on the paternal allele is methylated so Igf2 is expressed and H19 is silenced.  Also in normal cells the imprint control region on th maternal allele is not methylated so CTCF binds to this region and insulates the enhancers from Igf2 which is not expressed but H19 is expressed instead.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting can result in both imprint control regions being methylated on the maternal and paternal chromosome which produces a double dose of Igf2 (oncogene) which is growth promoting an leads to Wilm's tumor.  Also since H19 is silenced on both maternal and paternal chromosomes the long non-coding RNA that H19 codes for is not expressed on either chromosome which could contribute to disease as well.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a class of drug known as a DNA De-methylating agent.  Decitabine results in decreased DNA methylation so some of the DNA methylation caused by the cancer might be reversed.  This reduction in DNA methylation could result in an antitumor effect if CpG islands on gene promoters for tumor supressor cells are demethylated.  This could result in the expression of these previously silenced tumor suppressor genes which could slow the growth of the cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer there is often hypermethylation of CpG islands such as gene promotes resulting in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes.  Once a drug that demethylates DNA removes these methyl groups that effect should be permanent unless the cancer re-methylates those areas.  So if the demethylating agent removes methylation from the promoter of a tumor suppressor gene that tumor suppressor gene could remain active, slowing the growth of the tumor, long after the drug treatment has stopped.  These drugs that affect DNA methylation should not be used during a sensitive period.  A sensitive period is a time when DNA methylation is being reset (being removed and being laid down).  Sensitive periods occur during early embyonic develepment and during germ cell development.  Drug treatment during these sensitive periods could disrupt the normal DNA methylation patterns and lead to disease.  It would be inadvisable to treat pregnant women or children in their early teens with these drugs.</p></div>
