    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in cancer is quite complex. First of all, CpG islands are genomic regions that contain a high frequency of CpG sites, and are found to be in the promoters of human genes (around 70%). The genes that control tumor suppression and other types of controls are hypermethylated through modificated histones, and the genes that are needed for the cancer cells are hypomethylated. This is accomplished in a wide range of time, expressing more and more oncogenes and hypermethylating control genes. <br />The disruption of the normal epigenomic of the cell causes genomic diseases, abnormal ploidy, deletions, insertions and so on and so forth, because of the lack of control proteins. The cell only grows and replicates.<br /> The function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions is to maintain genomic stability, to prevent any kind of abnormal division or insdel operations within the chromosomes. The repetitive elements protect the genome from transposable elements. When these mechanisms are disrupted, normal function of the cell is disrupted. Cancer cells, when modify the epigenome, hypomethylated or hypermethylated regions of the genome that maintain stability, leading to improve the cancer pathways.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/lgf2 clusted is included in the role of parent-of-origin-dependant gene expression, achieved my DNA methylation. H19 is methytlated (imprinted) on the paternal allele, whereas is unmethylated on the maternal allele. As H19 is not methylated, the enhancers acts over H19, and on the paternal allele, H19 is methylated, so lgf2 is expressed. In Wilm's tumor, hypermethylation is observed on both maternal and paternal alleles, so lgf2 is expressed from both alelles, having double dose of lgf2, which is a growth promoting, giving the tumour more machinery for growing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, meaning that lower the overactivity of methylation of tumor cells. This hypermethylation affects histones and the genes around, silencing the tumor suppressor genes, or the genes that control cell growth. When this drug is applied, inhibits the overactivity of methylation in these regions, leading to the cell to take over the control factor and slowing its growth or even killing the tumor cells in succesive divisions, as the epigenomic is inherited by the daughter cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The cells, when they go under mitosis, each daughter cell inherits the epigenetic of its mother, so, any modification to the epigenome will last beyond the period of drug treatment. The sensitive periods are when epigenetic marks are being stablished, as for example few days after the oocyte goes under mitosis, or during childhood, when the baby is developimg at a rapid rate. <br />If the epigenome is modified during this stage, the outcome is unclear, because first: The baby is under development and epigenomics are nor fully understood, and the effect over the germ cells is unknown.</p></div>
