    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are specific sequences of DNA found in approximately 60% of promoters. In general, methylation of promoter regions of genes inversely correlates with transcription activity. However, CpG islands usually are not methylated, independent of activity state of particular genes. CpG islands often are found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes which have to be active in order to prevent aberrant proliferation of the cell. One of the epigenetic changes typical for cancer cells is the hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands, leading to the silencing of underlying genes. There is a body of evidence that different tumour types may hypermetylate different sets of CpG islands that belong to tumor suppressor genes and that CpG island methylation progresses with time. Silencing of tumor suppressor genes causes and/or supports deregulated cell proliferation, a typical property of cancer cells.</p>
<p>Unlike CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements (which make up most of the genome) usually are methylated and kept heterochromatinized. The function of methylation here is not gene silencing, but rather maintaining of genomic integrity and stability by keeping these regions unable to undergo recombination. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated (genome-wide hypomethylation), what is a very common process in tumorigenesis. Similarly like methylation of CpG islands this hypomethylation progresses with time and increases genomic instability, witness the higher rate of illegitimate recombination between repeats in cancer cells. Products of illegitimate recombination often include fused or lost chromosomes, reciprocal translocations, deletions, duplications and fusions of genes. Some repeats even have capacity to make a copy of themselves and transpose after they are activated by hypomethylation. They may disrupt the coding region of another gene as well as they may activate neighboring genes. All these genetic aberrations usually mean significantly worse prognosis for the patient.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting is a common feature of cancer, witness the example of H19/Igf2 cluster. On the maternal allele, this cluster of genes contains an imprinting control region (ICR) which is unmethylated and able to bind insulator protein CTCF. CTCF protein insulates Igf2 locus from downstream enhancers, thus blocking its expression. Instead of Igf2, downstream enhancers then support expression of long noncoding RNA H19 which serves as a reservoir for particular micro RNA and has nothing to do with epigenetic modifications at this particular cluster. On the paternal allele, ICR is methylated and this methylation spreads downstream to the H19 promoter containing CpG islands, silencing its expression. Methylated ICR cannot bind insulator protein CTCF and the downstream enhancers preferentially support transcription of Igf2 gene. In Wilm´s tumour disruption or loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster causes paternal uniparental disomy -  it means that both alleles behave like the paternal allele with active transcription of Igf2. This results in overdose of Igf2 gene product (it is a protein called insulin-like growth factor II), and it causes aberrant  overgrowth of diseased cells in kidneys of patients with Wilm´s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug affecting epigenetic processes. According to its function it belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (hypomethylating agents). Structurally it is very similar to 5-azacytidine, its chemical name is 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine. Decitabine is a cytidine analog, so it gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication and causes irreversible binding of DNA methyltransferases which then cannot copy the methylation to the daughter strand of DNA. Decitabine (as well as other DNA methyltransferase inhibitors) works division-dependently and that is why cancer cells are much more vulnerabe to treatment by this drug - they divide more rapidly. One of Decitabine´s main functions is preventing CpG island hypermethylation. Hypermethylated CpG islands in gene promoters are one of the most common features in cancer. They usually cause silencing of underlying genes, including tumour suppressor genes, responsible for apoptosis in cells altered by cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are transferred during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells – they are mitotically heritable. If DNA methylation is altered (for example upon replication as a result of drug treatment) the cells will only produce daughter cells with altered methylation and so on. This is the reason why drugs altering DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment. These drugs inhibit and/or remove patological changes in epigenome characteristic for cancer cells (for example CpG islands hypermethylation). However, there are so called sensitive periods during which the treatment of patients by these drugs is inadvisable. A sensitive period can be defined as a period of active remodelling of the epigenome when epigenetic marks in whole genome are removed and laid down. The cells in this period are most sensitive to environmental factors  (nutrition, diet, drugs...). Sensitive periods in human organism are the period of primordial germ cells development all the way through to the production of mature gametes and the pre-implanted and early post-implantation period of embryonic development. Treating patients during these periods is inadvisable because of high risk of infertility or embryonic lethality or imprinting disorders in the next generation, respectively.</p></div>
