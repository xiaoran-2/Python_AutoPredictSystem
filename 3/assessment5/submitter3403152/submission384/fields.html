    <h1>Submission 384 from Anon (session_user_id: 88c6bdf6b003130637f24ef792e5cc99b095c28c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal state, CpG islands are kept mostly unmethylated. In contrast, CpG islands can be hypermethylated in cancer silencing transcription. In contrast to that, intergenic regions and repetetive elements are usually methylated in order to suppress transcrition of those sites. During cancer, these sites may become hypomethylated, allowing for expression of otherwise silenced genes, transcription of repetitive elements, and genomic instbility in general.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Usually, the paternal allele of the the H19/Igf2 cluster carries a methylated intragenic control region (ICR), allowing the distal enhancer to act on Igf2, H19 is silenced. In females, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing the enhancer to act on the H19 promotor, leading to H19 expression, while Igf2 is silenced. Wilm's tumor patients show increased H19 expression due to loss of methylation at the ICR of the paternal copy of the allele. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA de-methylating drug, meaning that it causes de-methylation of DNA. In tumors, heavy methylation often correlates with poor prognosis, presumably due to methylation-dependent suppression of transcription of tumor suppressor genes. Since this class of drugs depends on active cell devision, it targets primarily the highly proliferating tumor cells.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, meaning that patterns get passed on to the daughter cells. Altering DNA methylation will thus have long-lasting effects.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods in which epigenetic marks are reset. These senstitive periods are early during embryonic development and during primordial germ cell formation. It would be inadvisable to treat patients during these stages, since off-target effects (effects other than on the cancer cells) cannot be ruled out. If the treatment would affect the embryo or the premordial germ cell, this would  affect the progeny with unpredictable outcome.  </p></div>
