    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylated CpG islands normally imply inhibition, as for example in deactivating transposable elements. Unmethylated CpG islands are often found in the promoter regions of active genes; however in cancers, these CpG islands can be heavily methylated (consider a tumor suppressor gene, which in cancer is methylated and repressed). That these CpG islands exist in the promoters of such important genes suggests that development requires them at some stage in development (consider for example the need to turn down apoptosis during embryogenesis with its rapid cell divisions); interestingly, cancers are exploiting preexisting cellular controls, which would otherwise be maintained in an opposite state. They may acquire this capability by random or enzymatic loss of methylation, which accumulates in aging genomes. Without strong inhibition by methylation two untoward processes are unleashed. The release of transposable elements allows them to become active and disrupt genes at new locations, or exposes access to cryptic promoters that can active nearby genes especially as they can also cause chromatin instabilities including transpositions (consider the Philadelphia chromosome in leukemia). The second bad process comes from the intergenic regions or even the introns themselves. Here the loss of methylation can also expose distant promoters thus deregulating expression or chromatin instability. Loss of methylation at the intron/exon boundaries can lead to aberrant splicing causing either loss of function or gain of function. Intriguingly, cancers seem to use DNA methylation to silence genes that are silenced in embryonic stem cells by means histone marks, which can give these cancer cells stem-cell-like expression profiles, including rapid uncontrolled growth, and escape from apoptosis. Further, there seems to be a balance between histone marks and DNA methylation such that a subtle shift in the intensity of one regulation to the other can either release or inhibit the proper regulation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Wilm’s tumour is an example of how imprinting errors can lead to cancer. In this case, the maternal imprinting control region (ICR) is typically not methylated, while the father’s is methylated. The lack of methyl marks on the maternal chromosome allows an insulating protein, CTCF to associate at the ICR. In this, normal, case down stream enhancers are blocked from enhancing expression of IGF2, upstream from the ICR. Consequently, the mother’s chromosome strongly expresses the lncRNA from H19 (an unmethylated region), but little IGF2, which is a growth factor (oncogenic). The H19 lncRNA is then processed to create micro-RNAs for use elsewhere. Also, the paternal chromosome normally has its ICR and H19 methylated, heterochromatic spreading from the ICR blocks H19 and prevents assembly with CTCF. In this case the down stream enhancers are able to enhance IGF2, which provides sufficient growth stimulant for proper development. In Wilm’s tumour, the maternal ICR is methylated so that no insulation from the downstream enhancers is available. Consequently, a bi-allelic  excess of the oncogenic IGF2 becomes available while lncH19 is not expressed from either chromosome. This growth signal promotes and maintains the kidney tumor in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-methylase transferase inhibiter causes hypomethylation of gene promoters. However, the mechanism is quite indirect. According to Karahoca and Momparler [Karahoca and Momparler Clinical Epigenetics 2013, 5:3 <a href="http://www.clinicalepigeneticsjournal.com/content/5/1/3">http://www.clinicalepigeneticsjournal.com/content/5/1/3</a>], Decitabine incorporates into DNA rather than cytosine. Then it binds irreversibly with, thus depleting DNA methyltransferases (DNMT3a/b) involved in <em>de novo</em> DNA methylation. Consequently during S-phase, highly methylated CpG islands in promoters for inactivated tumor suppressor genes are copied without transmission of the methylation marks. Thus, the suppressor is reactivated in the daughter cell. These cells are then more susceptible to either apoptosis or further differentiation into non-cancerous cells. Cells that fail to fully reactivate may be susceptible to subsequent chemotherapy. Decitabine also appears to have other effects including suppression of genes involved in angiogenesis (reducing solid tumor blood supply) and in general up regulating DNA repair genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, any drug that changes methylation marks (other than in post mitotic cells) will have linage or intergenerational impacts. While this is good for treating the mitotic divisions found in a cancer, the treatment could be catastrophic if the drug were administered at sensitive periods during normal development. These sensitive periods are when the epigenetic marks are being reset, initialized or elaborated for linage differentiation, sex-specific imprinting or more importantly during primordial germ cell development. Specifically, early embryogenesis during which linage specific marks are being removed to form the embryonic stem cells are a sensitive period, as is the subsequent period during which imprinting (parental specific) genes are being reset and initialized according to the sex of the embryo. A finally sensitive period would be during the creation of embryonic germ cells, which requires resetting genetic marks and passage through a stage that resembles totipotency. Use of DNA-demethylating drugs during these periods could change the developmental program or could release the transposable elements and should be avoided.</p></div>
