    <h1>Submission 1056 from Anon (session_user_id: 025f996dba6aca9ae7435a476767413237197c8b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor (DNAMTi).  It is a nuceloside analogue.  Decitabine irreversibly binds to DNAMT after they are incorporated into DNA, therefore replication dependendent and requirees active cell replication.</p>
<p>In a normal cell CpG islands are hypomethylated and in cancer they are hypermethylated.  The Decitabine could be used to de-methylate the CpG islands allowing for reactivation of the tumor suppressor genes.  DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark, passed onto subsequent cell generations.  Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, these de-methylated CpG islands would be passed down to the subsequent daughter cells. Resulting in cells with active tumor suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in about 60% of promoters.  Promoters have a high CpG density and are usually hypomehtylated regardless of their activity state.  In cancer cells, promoter CpG islands become hypermethylated which results in silencing of the underlying gene.  This hypermethylated state can cause silencing of the tumor suppressor genes which would control the cell cycle, apoptosis, or DNA repair.  The normal cell is hypermethylated in the intergenic regions and repetive elements allowing for genome stability and cell regulation.  In cancer, the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated resulting in genomic instablility and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes </p>
<p>DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark since it is mitotically heritable resulting in a continutation of the aberration.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells lose imprinted expression.  They can be hypo or hypermethylated  resulting in expression from both parent alleles or repressed from both parent alleles.  The imprint control region (ICR) of the paternal allele is hypermethylated thus not allowing the CTCF to bind to it which will result in the enhancers acting on the Igf2 gene resulting in expression.  The maternal allele is hypomethylated allowing the CTCF to bind to the ICR thereby disallowing the enhancers to act on the IgF2 gene and act on H19 thus silencing expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, both alleles are hypermethylated at the ICR disallowing binding of CTCF on the maternal allele, resulting in the enhancers to act on the gene from both alleles.  The H19 is suppressed on the maternal allele and the enhancers act on the gene from both parents.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylaton is a very stable epigentic mark.  It is passed onto subsequent cell generations through mitotic heritability.  A sensitive period would be a time when you would want to avoid treating patients with such drugs.  Sensitive times would be during germ cell development.  These sensitive periods would include fetal life through puberty, so you would not want to use these drugs on children until they have completed puberty when gern cells are susecptible.</p></div>
