    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG islands are generally unmethylated but in cancer cells these CpG islands can be hypermethylated which can disrupt the normal function of the gene when the regions that express tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated and therefore silenced.</p>
<p>CpG islands that are unmethylated at the promoter regions of genes typically have open chromatin - euchromatin - and the genes are open for expression.  Hypermethylation is usually associated with closed chromatin - heterochromatin - and gene silencing marks. As evidenced in studies of colorectal cancer, regional silencing of specific CpG islands can impact neighboring chromatin which may not itself be hypermethylated.  This Long Range Epigenetic Silencing- LRES - can cause compaction of the whole neighboring region.</p>
<p>When genes that regulate the cell cycle or suppress the proliferation of damaged DNA are silenced in this way, the uncontrolled cell proliferation that is necessary to initiate the development of cancer can develop.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and increases with time, but it is also reversible and therefore a possible target to chemotherapies.</p>
<p>In normal cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated to prevent genomic instability and oncogene activation. </p>
<p>Cancer is characterized by a general hypomethylation of these repetitive elements and intergenic regions.  Without methylation the repetitive elements of the gene become destabilized and are then prone to recombination which can result in genetic mutations such as chromosome deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations and copy number variations. </p>
<p>CpG poor promoter regions that become hypomethylated can activate oncogenes and hypomethylated imprint control regions (ICR) can alter the normal functioning of the cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div dir="ltr">In normal somatic cells, the allele inherited from the father is hypermethylated at the H19 coding region which suppresses the expression of this long non coding RNA so that only the Igf2 gene is expressed from the paternal allele. 
<div dir="ltr"> </div>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">The allele inherited from the mother is unmethylated at the H19 gene. The unmethylated ICR (imprint control region) of H19 allows the CTCF protein to bind in a way that limits access of the downstream enhancers to Igf2 expression on that allele.</div>
<div dir="ltr"> </div>
<div dir="ltr">In Wilm's tumour the H19 gene is hypermethylated on both the maternal and the paternal allele which causes overexpression of Igf2 and underexpression of H19. Hypermethylation of the imprint control region (ICR) located at the H19/Igf2 cluster can cause the cell to lose the expression of H19 that restricts growth  and to overexpress the Igf2 genes which promote growth.</div>
<div dir="ltr"> </div>
<div dir="ltr">Insulin-like growth factor (Igf2)  regulates growth in fetal development but becomes effectively doubled when the H19 region is hypermethylated along the maternal allele. A common early epimutation seen in pre-neoplastic cells, this loss of imprinting at ICR eliminates the natural balance of growth hormone expression and suppression that leads then to uncontrolled growth in cancerous cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of small molecule epigenetic inhibitors that  target enzymatic epigenetic regulators which would normally lay down an epigenetic mark, in this case DNMT- DNA methyltransferase - which is the enzyme responsible for maintaining CpG island methylation after cell division.  Decitabine  indiscriminately attacks CpG island hypermethylation. </p>
<p>DNMT1 mainly methylates the hemi-methylated strands of CpG dinucleotides and is responsible for the maintenance of methylation marks after mitotic cell division. Decitabine is incorporated into the DNA at cell division so that the DNMT cannot bind to the CpG island and methylation does not occur.  This inhibition of methylation must occur at the time of cell division but cancer cells proliferate at a faster rate and would be disproportionately affected.</p>
<p>Haematological malignancies are dependent on the hypermethylation and therefore silencing of tumour suppressor genes. By repressing the methylation after cell division Decitabine reactivates these silenced tumour suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes made to the epigenetic state of the cell are mitotically heritable so that the daughter cells will continue to have the epigenetic configuration of the parent cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods in development are those periods of demethylation when the DNA is unprotected by methylation marks.</p>
<p>These periods of epigenome sensitivity occur during early embryonic development when the paternal and maternal allele of the zygote are demethylated and then somewhat later when germ cell development in the embryo causes imprinted genes to demethylate and associate with the appropriate male or female allele.  There is also evidence that oocytes and spermatocytes do not complete methylation until puberty so childhood could be considered a sensitive period for the developing egg or sperm in male or female children. </p>
<p>Treatment that affects methylation or other epigenetic regulation in these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because known treatments are not targeted to specific malignant cells but affect the methylation or acetylation of all cells of the body including those in developing germ cells.</p></div>
