    <h1>Submission 1541 from Anon (session_user_id: 123f261aa6d97ae78be1e46f9a2eba51ece2f0b7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating <span>class of epigenetic inhibitors. </span>It is in the form of azacitidine are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p><span>As we know that the DNA methylation is reversible, drugs like decitabine, and histone deacetylase inhibitors are being used to treat a variety of tumors</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>By altering the DNA methylation through drugs can have enduring effects on the epigenome that last beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>The sensitive period is a time of development which is actually sensitive to the epigenetic control. Our environment can our effects on epigenetic control but not necessary in any stage of development but especially during the sensitive periods of development. </p>
<p>There are two sensitive periods that are primordial germ cell development till the production of gametes and the pre-implantation and early post implantation period.</p>
<p>Treating a patient like younger patients particularly those who are in the sensitive periods (developing germ cells) inhibits the epigenetic machinery.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are are genomic regions that contain a high frequency of CpG sites which are about 60% of promoters. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. </p>
<p>In cancer cells the promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. In cancer, historically the earliest epigenetic aberration found was a genomewide lack of methylation, hypomethylation at intergenic regions/ repeats, and genomic instability.</p>
<div>
<p>In many disease processes, gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as an important component of cancer development.</p>
<p>The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to silence the cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. </p>
<p>The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposition, silencing of repeats, so avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination. DNA methylation is mutagenic, so must also be a benefit i.e. protect the genome  from transposable elements Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At the imprinted loci H19/Igf2 cluster, the differentially methylated domains possess enhancer-blocking activity that restricts enhancer to promoter interactions, preventing promoter activation.</p>
<p>CTCF is an insulator protein which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers and DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding. So on paternal allele CTCF can no longer bind and DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate. Thats why igf2 only expressed only from the paternal allele not from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>Methylation of ICR on maternal allele silences Kcnq1ot1 which is a long noncoding RNA recruits G9a and PRC2 that perform H3K9me and H3K27me also silencing in cis. </p>
<p><span>Wilm’s tumour c</span>ommonly caused by deletion or inappropriate silencing of the paternal copy of 15q11-13</p></div>
