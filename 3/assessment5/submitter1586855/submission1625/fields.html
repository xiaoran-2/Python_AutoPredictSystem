    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are the regions in genome that have high frequency of CpG dinucleotides. They often are located withing gene's promotors. Methylation state of CpG islands is directly connected with gene expression. For example in housekeeping genes CpG islands are unmethylated and this allows the genes expression. On the other hand methylation of CpG islands correlates with gene silencing. In cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated and hypermethylation increases with disease progression. This can lead to the transcriptional silencing of cancer suppressor genes. Together with CpG islands, neighboring regions which are called CpG shores are also hypermethylated in cancer. The set of hypermethylated genes is different in every tumor type and can be useful in diagnosis, prognosis and establishing the treatment of the disease.Repetitive elements and intergenic regions can be very active in terms of transposition. Usually this parts of the genome are methylated to insure the genomic stability. In contrast in cancer repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated that leads to genomic instability like transpositions and activation of repeats, recombination between repeats, activation of cryptic promotors etc. As well as in the situation with CpG islands hypermethylation, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repeats in cancer starts early and progresses with time.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Genomic imprinting is a mechanism of transcriptional regulation where expression of a mammalian genes subset is restricted to either paternal or maternal allele. Imprinted genes are usually located in clusters that also include an imprinting control region (ICR). In the case of <span>H19/Igf2 cluster ICR in maternal allele is unmethylated and so far is able to bind CTCF protein. Such a complex acts as an insulator and prevents the enhancers from activating Igf2 gene that has growth-stimulating and mitogenic abilities. In the same time enhancers on maternal allele activate<span> the promotor of </span><em>H19</em><span> gene, which encodes an ncRNA. </span><span>On the paternal chromosome ICR is methylated and cannot bind CTCF. This leads to the absence of insulator complex and to the activation by the enhancers that promotor of Igf2 gene. In Wilm's tumor Igf2 is overexpressed due to the loss of imprinting. In this case both paternal and maternal ICR are hypermethylated, so enhancers on both alleles activate the Igf2 promotor and this leads to increased expression of Igf2, which is a growth-promoting hormone.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (or Dacogen) is the drug that belongs to the class of the DNA methyltransferases inhibitors. As a molecule, Decitabine is one of deoxycytidine analogues (5-aza-2’-deoxycytydine). It is incorporated into DNA and can irreversibly binds to DNMT enzymes.<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In this way Decitabine depletes the </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">DNMT activity in cells, which leads to DNA hypomethylation in gene promotor regions.</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Decitabine is used for the treatment of myeloblastic syndromes that progress to AML. <span>Decitabine-induced </span><span>hypomethylation in cancer cells may restore normal function to genes (like tumor suppressors) that are necessary for the control </span><span>of cellular differentiation and proliferation.</span>Taking into account that neoplastic cells divide much faster, Decitabine has much bigger effect on cancer cells than on normal cells. However, long-term effects of this drug on the normal cells are not well-studied.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Targeting epigenetic changes represents the novel way of cancer treatment.Since epigenetic marks can be passed to the daughter cells it is possible to stop growth of tumor without killing of its cells. DNA hyper or hypomethylation alters the balance between expression of cancer suppressors and oncogenes. Sensitive period for epigenome is the time when epigenetic marks are established. There are 2 major sensitive periods in development: early preimplantation period and a period of formation primordial germ cells. T<span>reating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because epigenetic marks are reset at this time.</span></p></div>
