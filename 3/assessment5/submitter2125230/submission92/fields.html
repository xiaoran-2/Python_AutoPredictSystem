    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your

    <div class="field-value"><p>The occurrence of Wilms Tumour in children with the Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome underscores the importance of gene-dosing and the mechanisms which control it.   Overexpression of the growth factor Igf2 results in the BWS's large-organ, large-body phenotype ("somatic overgrowth"), and the predisposition to embryonal tumors which usually occur in the first 8-10 years of life.</p>
<p>The chromosome 11p15.5 contains  two  genes  of interest:  H19 (a non-coding RNA);  and insulin-like growth factor 2 (1GF2) -- a paternally-expressed fetal <strong>growth</strong> factor.  Imprint control region IC1, located between these two genes,  is usually <em><strong>methylated</strong></em> <strong><em>on the paternal chromosome</em></strong> and <strong><em>unmethylated on the maternal chromosome  </em></strong><em> </em>Gain-of-methylation inhibits binding of the CTCF-insulator-protein to the methylated ICR; so interaction between the ICR and a downstream "enhancer" region of DNA is altered, so that H19 transcription is turned off, but Igf2 is activated; the resulting double-dose of Igf2 is instrumental in the development of BWS.</p>
<p>   Although this mechanism accounts for only 5% of BWS cases, it is associated with the greatest risk for Wilms tumor.   </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal tissues, we find that CpG islands tend to be <em><strong>un</strong></em>methylated, in sharp contradiction to repetitive elements and intergenic regions (REIRs), where the most notable feature is <em><strong>methyl</strong></em><strong></strong>ation.  These findings are strikingly<strong> <em>reversed</em><em></em></strong> in cancer, where <strong>genome-wide hypomethylation</strong> is accompanied by the <strong>increased methylation of CpGIs </strong>(the memorable acronym being<br />"CIMP"--<strong>C</strong>pG <strong>I</strong>sland<strong> M</strong>ethylator <strong>P</strong>henotype).  Since the hallmark of cancer is a loss of control for cellular growth and organisation, it is useful to evaluate the contribution of CpGIs and REIRs to gene expression.</p>
<p>     CpGIs are located in about 60% of the promotor regions of genes.  They are usually kept free of methylation.  However cancerous cells demonstrate hypermethylation of these CpG promotor regions, resulting in silencing of the associated gene. When the gene is a crucial "tumor suppressor gene", such as p53 or RB, loss of function permits tumour growth.</p>
<p>     In  somatic mammalian cells, about 70-80% of the cytosine bases are methylated, leading to silencing of the gene.  This occurs primarily in the REIRs.  The most plausible function of  this intragenic methylation is that it serves to  1) eliminate interference from alternative start sites,  2) inhibit antisense transcription,  3) direct the RNA splicing by which gene products can be <em>reassembled</em> into variable regions of enzymes or antibodies, 4) compact repetitive elements into heterochromatin to eliminate mutation-producing insertions and deletions.  Methylation patterns are tissue-specific, and help determine chromatin compartmentalization (into the silent heterochromatin periphery vs. the euchromatinic transcription factories centered on RNAPII)   It is thus hardly surprising that cancers, with their extreme heterogeneity and astonishing variations, display <strong>c</strong>ancer-specific <strong>d</strong>ifferentially <strong>m</strong>ethylation <strong>r</strong>egions (cDMRs).</p>
<p>     [Mechanistically,  methylation -- or its absence, determines the region of euchromatin which is to be transcribed through its impact on  "DNA-looping",  the 3D-conformation of the euchromatin strand during transcription. . .]</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation of CpG promotor sites, their silencing leading to  loss-of-function of their associated tumour-supressor-genes, is frequently encountered in cancer.  Decitabine (commercially "Dacogen") is a <strong>DNA-methyltransferase inhibito</strong><strong>r </strong>currently used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. This deoxycytidine analog  incorporates into DNA, forming  irreversible covalent bonds with DNA-methyltransferases (Mtases) at cytosine sites targeted for methylation.  DNA synthesis stalls, and DNA-Mtase degrades; when DNA synthesis resumes, it does so without methylation, so that gene expression is reactivated.  This results in reversion to the non-cancerous phenotype -- differentiation, reduced proliferation, and/or increased susceptibility to apoptosis.   Since the drug requires active DNA synthesis for its own activity, rapidly proliferating cancerous cells should be more affected than normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA-methylation is heritable during mitosis.  Thus, cancer cells which develop hypermethylation will propagate these methyl marks to  all their progeny.  In addition, tumors tend to accumulate increasingly more DNA-methylation as they progress.   Ideally, reversal of the "CIMP" (<strong>C</strong>pG <strong>I</strong>sland <strong>M</strong>ethylator <strong>P</strong>henotype) would restore cancer cells towards a pattern of better control (differentiation, reduced proliferation, greater susceptibility to apoptosis).  However, DNA-methylation is removed and reprogrammed during <strong>gametogenesis</strong> and again<strong> after fertilization</strong>.  A total interruption of the ability to re-establish <em>appropriate</em><strong></strong> methyl marks during these sensitive periods would produce havoc in gene expression patterns.     Regarding the use of DNA-methlytransferase inhibitors already on the market, the FDA-approved advice to prescribers therefore includes these warnings: <em><strong> "Advise women to avoid becoming pregnant during and for 1 month after completion of treatment, and men not to father a child during and for 2 months after completion of treatment."</strong></em></p></div>
