    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA is typically methylated in certain parts of the genome in regular cells and unmethylated in others.</p>
<p>In these regular cells CpG islands are not methylated, and this allows for the expression of nearby genes. In cancer cells, the CpG islands are hypermethylated, therefore the genes  contained in close proximity to these CpGIs are silenced. In cancer, the genes silenced are the tumor supressor genes. If these genes are silenced, then the mechanisms of DNA repair, apoptosis and tumor suppression do not take place; therefore tumors grow.</p>
<p>On the other side, in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements we can usually find methylation in normal cells; and this helps give the genome stability. However, in cancer cells these regions are hypomethylated, and this causes genomic instability, which in turn facilitates the generation of tumors in the tissue.</p>
<p>These 2 mechanisms combined have been found in different cancer samples, and they both contribute to tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor is used to treat the precursos of a certain type of leukimia, therefore acting as a prevention therapy. Decitabine is a DNA hypomethylation agent. And as it name implies, it demethylates the genome. This demethylation can counter the hypermethylation in CpG islands and CpG island shores, therefore enabling the genes that were silenced by the methylaiton to be expressed again. Following this path of action, then the active genes can resume their anti-tumor function, thus preventing cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The altering of DNA methylation (as we have seen in this course) is an epigenetic mark; and once it is settled, it is conserved in daughter cells, which explains the enduring effects. Considering that the drug made an epigenetic modification on the tumor cells, as the cells divide they will be more open to the chemotherapy since the changes are passed over to the cells that generate from the originally affected cells. However, the use of these drugs should be carried out with caution, since drugs that target the epigenetic machinery can have side effects because they act through the system; and this caution should be considered specially during sensitive periods. A sensitive period is an important period of development (like the period in which germ cells are formed) in which cells are specially sensitive to epigenetic stimuli. Therefore if a patient is treated with epigeentic therapy during a sensitive period, the sensitive cells can have their genome alterated, and in turn instead of helping the patient we could be damaging cells on genomic level.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can cause cancer because many imprinted genes are invlved in growth. For example  in the H19/Igf2 cluster; in normal cell the paternal allele is methylated on ICR and Igf2 will be expressed; whereas in the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and while Igf2 will be silent, H19 is expressed. However, in Wilm's tumour this imprinting is disrupted: the ICR is methylated in both the maternal and paternal alleles, and Igf2 will be doubly expressed and there will be no expression of H19.  This disruption will make the cells have a double dose of Igf2, which is a growth gene and this will in turn bring about the uncontrolled growth of the cell, and tumours as a result of this.</p></div>
