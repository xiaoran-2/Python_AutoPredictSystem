    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>     CpG islands (CGIs) are located near most genes, including many of the house-keeping genes required for the survival of all cell-types. They are generally unmethylated and act as ‘platforms’ (A. Bird) from which to set up the structures activating neighbouring promoters. When methylated, they serve a different purpose: the protein complexes that bind them promote local DNA compaction into heterochromatin and thus lead to inactivation of the nearby genes. </p>
<p>Cancerous cells do not have a normal pattern of DNA methylation: CGIs become hyper-methylated whereas genes, intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypo-methylated. CGI hyper-methylation may lead to the inactivation of a critical tumour suppressor gene (as in retinoblastoma) or of a set of genes (as in glioma), thereby inhibiting the cancerous cell’s ability to regulate division or to initiate apoptosis. </p>
<p>In normal tissue, DNA methylation of intergenic regions and of repetitive elements promotes genomic stability by preventing illegitimate recombination between homologous loci and by silencing the transposon activity of repetitive elements. In neoplastic cells, however, the hypo-methylation of such regions allows illegitimate recombinations and transpositions to occur. </p>
<p>Such events may result in deletions, insertions and translocations that disrupt cell function. In particular, oncogenes may come under the control of an activated cryptic promoter, or a transposon may inactivate a tumour suppressor gene, thereby leading to cancer. Alternatively, hypo-methylation of a promoter may lead to overexpression of the corresponding oncogene (e.g., R-RAS in gastric cancer).The set of epigenetically affected genes determines the nature and clinical grade of the cancer. This can be assessed by various mapping and sequencing techniques, affording oncologists a useful panel of diagnostic and prognostic data.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>   Abnormal methylation of ICRs may result in faulty expression of growth-regulating genes. It is a common feature of pre-neoplastic phenotypes, as illustrated by the H19/Igf2 locus.</p>
<p>In normal tissue, the ICRs at the two alleles of the H19/Igf2 locus are differentially methylated. The <em>paternal</em> ICR is methylated, and methylation spreads to the promoter of the H19 gene. This effectively silences expression of the H19 gene. Instead, the downstream enhancers promote transcription of the more distant Igf2 gene (a growth factor).</p>
<p>In contrast, the <em>maternal</em> ICR is unmethylated and binds the CTC factor, which acts as a boundary or insulator to prevent the enhancers from activating the Igf2 gene. The enhancers are free to promote expression of the nearby H19 gene, whose promoter is also unmethylated. Thus, H19 and Igf2 are each expressed from a different allele, at about half the rate that would be achieved if they were expressed on both alleles.</p>
<p>In Wilms’ tumour, the hyper-methylation of the maternal ICR spreads to the H19 promoter and prevents CTCF binding. Transcription of H19 is thus silenced on both alleles, whereas Igf2 is expressed from both alleles. Excess Igf2 results in a pre-neoplastic cellular phenotype.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>   Decitabine is an analog of Cytosine, a nucleotide precursor required for DNA synthesis. Whereas Cytosine has a Carbon at position 5 on its pyrimidine ring, Decitabine has a Nitrogen atom at that position and it cannot be methylated <em>in vivo</em>.</p>
<p>When DNA is being replicated in preparation for cell division, the DNA synthesis machinery does not discriminate between Decitabine triphosphate and dCTP, with the result that the Decitabine base is incorporated into DNA wherever a Cytosine should have gone. The (N5)-substituted CpG motifs of the newly synthesized DNA strand cannot be methylated.</p>
<p>The methylation of CpG islands mapping close to tumour suppressor genes may cause some forms of cancer because aberrantly methylated islands recruit factors that initiate and maintain DNA compaction into heterochromatin, thereby preventing tumour suppressor gene expression. DNA replication in the presence of Decitabine may reverse the process in daughter cells of the tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>   Drugs such as Decitabine alter DNA methylation stably: daughter cells that inherit hypo-methylated CpG’s do not in general methylate them back to their initial level because the maintenance DNMT1 requires a hemi-methylated substrate.</p>
<p>Although such drugs are useful in treating some forms of cancer, they are likely to interfere with the epigenetic remodeling taking place at two sensitive periods: during gametogenesis and in the pre-implantation embryo. In gametogenesis, prior marks in the gamete precursors must be erased while preserving those necessary for imprinting. In the pre-implantation embryo, the epigenetic marks must be correctly re-established.</p>
<p>Interfering with DNA methylation is therefore quite inadvisable in people of reproductive age desiring to become parents. Treating women is a particular concern because the drugs may affect not only their oocytes but also the pre-implantation embryo they may carry. In addition, at a later stage in pregnancy the drugs may alter the epigenetic status of the fetus’ developing primordial germ cells, thereby potentially affecting not just one but two generations of offspring. </p></div>
