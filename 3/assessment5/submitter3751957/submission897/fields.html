<p>DNA methylation is one of the important mechanisms by which gene expression is regulated, repeat elements in the genome are silenced, chromatin is organised , imprinting and X-inactivation is established. This mechanism works concurrently with histone modifications, nucleosome positioning and miRNAs. The pattern of methylation in a normal cell is that there is hypomethylation at  CpG islands, usually found at promoters or start of genes and where the transcription machinery binds and methylation in repetitive elements, interons  and intergenic  regions.</p>
<p>In an actively dividing cancer cell the reverse occurs. There is increasing genome wide hypomethylation  and increasing hypermethylation at the CpG islands, resulting in silencing of the tumour suppressor gene. Being an epigenetic mark it is carried through to daughter cells. The consequence, cells undergo rapid division , apoptasis  does not occur, it may allow metastasis because cell adhesion has been lost and finally may lead to the activation of oncogenes.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions serves as a genomic stabilising factor. It assists in the reduction of the incidence of insertions or deletions of chromatic material and secondly reducing the translocation of this material. Some gene silencing also occurs.</p>
<p>At repetitive elements,  methylation also  serves to maintain genomic stability. It does this by silencing repeats to transposition of elements, increasing mutations of meC to T and avoiding potentially damaging transcriptions by cis or trans effects.</p>
<p>In cancer cells the normal hypermethylation patterns in repeat elements and intergenic regions are changed to hypomethylated regions. The consequence of this that genomic instability results where transposition of elements occurs (placing elements in regions of chromosomes where they interfere with normal expression of surrounding genes), transcriptional interference is allowed to occur and recombination results. All of these events manifest in the progression of the cancer over time.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Imprinting is a form of epigenetic modification which controls gene expression by selectively expressing one allele over another based on the parent-of-origin.  Disruption to the imprinting pattern via the loss of methyl groups switches on those genes and  disrupts growth potentially leading to cancer and other syndromes.</p>
<p>Paternal imprinting occurs at the H19/Igf2 cluster on chromosome 11 in the human genome along with  spreading of DNA methylation into the H19 promoter resulting in it being silenced. The CTCF insulator protein also cannot bind to the ICR due to this methylation. This allows the enhancers to access the Igf2 gene , resulting in the production of insulin-like growth factor 2.</p>
<p>                                               </p>
<p>On the maternal allele the ICR/H19 are not methylated, therefore on. Insulator protein CTCF binds to the maternal ICR and this results in the enhancers not being able to access the Igf2 gene but instead enhance expression of H19 a tumour suppressor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The under-expression of the H19 gene as a result of hypermethylation on the maternal allele as seen in Wilms’ tumour along with the hypermethylated paternal gene increases the production of insulin-like growth factor 2 which is implicated in these tumours and other syndromes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Decitabine or 5-aza-2’-dexoycytidine is a hypomethylating drug used to treat certain myelodysplastic syndromes. It is classed as a nucleoside analog, more specifically a cytidine analog. The drug works best on actively dividing cells which cancer cells are and stops the methylation pattern being passed on to the daughter cells.</p>
<p>By hypomethylating the CpG islands at promoter genes the tumour suppressor gene is effectively switched on and the risk of cancer reduced. This methylating pattern is passed on to daughter cells. This process appears to be dose sensitive, the lower dose more effective. The drug also works more effectively when used with histone-deacetylase inhibitors and has been shown to slow the growth of solid tumours. This is significant as there appears to be an increased drug penetrance of the  solid tumours which  has been difficult to achieve up to this point.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Epigenetic modifications are changes which alter gene expression and therefore phenotype. They are reversible and occur without permanent changes to the DNA sequence. These epigenetic  modifications can be passed on from daughter cell to daughter cell. The effect of drugs such as decitabine and azacitidine which are used to hypomethylate regions of the epigenome,  this alteration it is passed onto the next generation of cells. These altered cells may be more susceptible to standard chemotherapy regimes</p>
<p>As these drugs work best on rapid, actively dividing cells they have the potential to also act on non-cancer cells undergoing the same rapid division. This occurs particularly during germ cell development and early development of the embryo. During these sensitive times methylation patterns are set and reset, important for the growth, development and differentiation. The hypomethylating effect of these drugs can drastically alter these epigenetic marks and therefore gene expression.</p>
<p>Along with these two sensitive periods the development of the foetus and early stages of growth of children are also critical as hypomethylation could interfere with the gene expression of many different genes. Therefore the use of these drugs would be age determined and stage of the disease.</p></div>
