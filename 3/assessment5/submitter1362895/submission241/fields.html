    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated. That is, they are likely to NOT be methylated. In cancer cells, on the other hand, CpG islands are hypermethylated – that is, it is likely that they ARE methylated.</p>
<p>CpG island hypermethylation in cancer cells typically affects tumour-suppressor genes. The hypermethylation ‘locks down’ the gene, and as a result the tumor-suppressor is not expressed. This locking down of tumor-suppressor genes constitutes one of the so-called ‘hits’ that are required - according to the Knudson hypothesis - for cancer to develop.</p>
<p>Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, this locking down represents an effective way of switching off the tumor-suppressor gene, and this type of epimutation is likely to be rapidly selected for.</p>
<p>In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally hypermethylated across the genome as a whole. That is, they are likely to be methylated. In cancer cells, however, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally hypomethylated across the genome. That is, they are likely to NOT be methylated.</p>
<p>As an example of how this contributes to disease, hypomethylation of repetitive elements leads to increased genomic instability – there is a greater likelihood of illegitimate recombination, there is more activation and transposition of repeats, there is activation of cryptic promoters, and so on. These alterations lead to aberrant outcomes of neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the ICR (imprinting control region) is methylated. This means that the insulator CTCF cannot bind to the ICR. As a result, the enhancers downstream act on Igf2 and this gene is expressed.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the ICR is NOT methylated. This means that the insulator CTCF can bind to the ICR. This prevents the enhancers from acting on Igf2, and so Igf2 is NOT expressed. Instead, the enhancers act on H19 and that gene is expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, the DNA methylation at the ICR is altered: we see hypermethylation. As a result, the ICR on the maternal allele is now ALSO methylated, so now CTCF cannot bind to the ICR on the maternal allele. Hence, the maternal allele now ‘looks like’ the paternal allele. The imprinting has been lost.</p>
<p>This disruption of the imprinting means that in BOTH parental alleles the downstream enhancers act on Igf2, and so Igf2 is expressed from BOTH parental alleles. As a result, we get a double dose of Igf2 compared to a normal cell. Igf2 is a growth factor, and this overexpression of Igf2 contributes to tumorigenesis in Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of drugs knows as DNA methyl transferase inhibitors (or DNMTi).</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, which means that it acts like a nucloeoside and is incorporated into the DNA during cell replication. Decitabine targets DNMT1. Normally, DNMT1 will copy DNA methylation to the daughter DNA strand after replication. However, Decitabine binds irreversibly to DNMT1, and this means that the DNMT1 can then no longer be released.</p>
<p>The action of Decitabine is dependent on cell division – it hits dividing cells. Since cancer cells are dividing more than normal cells, they are more strongly affected by the drug. Decitabine is used at much lower dosage levels than was previously the case for DNMTi drugs. At these lower dosage levels the drug causes demethylation and has an anti-neoplastic effect - that is, it kills tumour cells. However, the full mechanism of the drug's action is not understood.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. This means that when the cell divides and DNA replication takes place, the DNA methylation marks will be copied to the daughter DNA strands. Hence, the daughter cells will have the same DNA methylation marks as the parent cell. In this way, any DNA methylation marks applied to one cell will be preserved in all of its progeny cells, and this means that DNA methylation will have an enduring effect.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of time during the development of an organism when epigenetic reprogramming takes place. If you interfere with the organism during a sensitive period, then this could have an influence on the progress of epigenetic reprogramming and, as a result, have a lasting effect on the organism.</p>
<p>There are two key sensitive periods of development. These are (1) during development of primordial germ cells; and (2) during early embryonic development.</p>
<p>If you treat a cancer patient with an epigenetic drug during a sensitive period, then epigenetic reprogramming may not be completed in the usual way and this could affect all cells of the developing organism.</p></div>
