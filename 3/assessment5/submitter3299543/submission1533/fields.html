    <h1>Submission 1533 from Anon (session_user_id: 7bf8afcabfd869401e8cc6183bdb462f1a6f1261)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors that are called DNA-demethylating agents, or hypomethylating agents. Once ingested, the body converts Decitabine into decitabine triphosphate. It incorporates decitabine triphosphate into the DNA where its main function is to inhibit the activity of DNA methyltransferases, therefore causing the DNA to become hypomethylated. This is very useful in cancer treatment. Abnormal DNA methylation is a strong characteristic of cancer. This leads to problems when tumour-suppressor genes, which are required to regulate cell growth, become methylated and are unable to be expressed. By removing the abnormal DNA methylation, Decitabine restores expression to the tumour-suppressor genes, which can then actively function to prevent the formation and growth of tumours due to uncontrolled cell growth.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can produce lasting effects on the epigenome because the new pattern of DNA methylation is inherited by the daughter cells each time the cell divides. This is useful for cancer treatment. However, it means there's no way to restore typical DNA methylation after treatment is complete. Because drugs that effect DNA methylation can't be targeted to one specific region, these altered DNA methylation patterns are maintained throughout the person's entire body following treatment.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is important for our bodies to regulate switching on and off genes, therefore disrupting normal methylation disrupts our body's regular functions. In general, the younger the patient, the more likely they are to be affected. This is especially true during sensitive periods of development, which are times when epigenetic marks are cleared and reprogrammed. Disruption during these periods can cause major epigenetic abnormalities in the offspring, leading to reduced viability or disease. The two main periods of epigenetic reprogramming are during primordial germ cell development, and during the early development of a fertilised egg up through the blastocyst stage. The effect on germ cells therefore needs to be considered when treating younger patients with DNA methylation altering drugs.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal, healthy cell CpG islands are unmethylated, allowing the gene directly following it to be expressed and function normally, while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated, which silences them and prevents them from being expressed and from causing potential disruptions to the normal functioning of the gene and the rest of the DNA. However, in cancer cells the exact opposite is found: CpG islands are methylated while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated.</p>
<p>By methylating the CpG islands, cancer silences the tumour suppressor genes that are normally expressed, which allows it to grow and replicate in an uncontrolled manner without the tumour suppressor genes restraining the abnormal growth as they usually would. Hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps the cancer by promoting genomic instability. By turning on many disruptive genes that are normally turned off, it makes illegitimate recombination events such as deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations more likely. These chromosomal abnormalities disrupt gene function and the normal mechanisms of the cell even more, making it easier for the cancer to expand and thrive without the normal processes of the cell interfering.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruptions of imprinting can have very serious consequences. In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, these consequences are due to incorrect gene dosage. The normal imprinting pattern is for the paternal allele to be methylated, and the maternal allele to be unmethylated. By methylating H19, CTCF is not able to bind to the paternal allele, therefore allowing enhancers to act on the Igf2 gene, which is then expressed. On the maternal allele, H19 is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind, which then blocks the enhancers from accessing Igf2 so Igf2 is silenced and they express the H19 gene instead. For normal function it's imperative that one allele is imprinted to express the Igf2 gene, and the other allele is imprinted to express the H19 gene.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele is incorrectly imprinted to be methylated in the same way as the paternal allele. This means that both copies of the allele express Igf2 and do not express H19. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene. By doubling the expression of growth promotion, the excess cell growth frequently leads to the formation of tumours, which in Wilm's tumour leads to cancer of the kidneys.</p></div>
