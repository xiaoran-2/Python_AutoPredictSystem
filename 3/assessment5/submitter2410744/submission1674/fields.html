    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells we can see hypomethylated CpG islands and we generally don't see methylation in CpG islands. But we find that the genome in general is methylated in the repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and indeed even in the introns of genes. </p>
<p>In contrast, if we look at a cancer cell the CpG islands are likely to be methylated. They are not all methylated, but they are more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell. The rest of the genome including the repetitive elements, the intergenic elements and the introns are hypomethylated. </p>
<p>So, there is a kind of reciprocal cross in terms of where the DNA methylation is found. This hypermethylation in CpG islands is found in cancer and it is called CpG island hypermethylation. Where the CpG islands are found is in the promoters of tumour supressor genes. As the epigenetic changes are mitotically inheritable this is a way of epigenetic silencing of tumour supressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>We know H19/Igf2 cluster is an imprint control region, methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it is unmethylated, CTCF binds insulator element and this means that the enhancers in this case will act on H19.  Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele so you don’t see expression.</p>
<p> On the paternal allele which it is methylated , the enhancers can act on Igf2, because CTCF is not binding to insulate this, and Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>With loss of imprinting what happens is that we have hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. Now, on the maternal allele we also have expression of the Igf2. So, we now have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to what we can see in a normal cell.</p>
<p>Igf2 is growth promoting and this is associated with Wilm’s tumour, this particular childhood kidney tumour.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting is observed in a very wide array of tumour types. And in fact it occurs as a very early event, so it’s often seen in preneoplastic tissues. This suggests that maybe these events at the imprint control region might be early events in tumourgenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug which is already on the market. It is a DNA-methyltraferase inhibitor, sold as Dacogen by Eisai company, and it is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. </p>
<p>The pattern in which the function of decitabine can be described is similar to the function of JQ1. JQ1 is a substance which inhibits an epigenetic regulator called BRD4 and blocks the activity of a gene by the name of <em>Myc</em>. <em>Myc</em> encodes a protein called a transcription factor and is involved in the expression of about 15% of human genes. Not surprisingly, when it goes wrong it is one of the most common causes of cancer.</p>
<p>Researchers have been unable to find a way to block the activity of <em>Myc</em> directly. However, by blocking BRD4, which is one of <em>Myc</em>'s collaborators, the job is done indirectly. After testing, JQ1 resulted in shutting down <em>Myc</em>-activated genes and slowing the proliferation of myeloma cells in mice. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a critical period in early development, which is determinant for the future development of the organism and the inheritable information which this organism can pass to the next generations. </p>
<p>The sensitive periods are periods early in development such as the fatal period and childhood. </p>
<p>Young patients who are developing germ cells is better to avoid this kind of treatment because the epigenetic alterations which will be caused by the treatment will be mitotically heritable and imprinted on the germ cells that the patient will produce.</p>
