    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands play role in DNA replication that is initiated there (Antequera, 2003), also they are associated with gene promoters (especially housekeeping genes and tumor suppressor genes) that tend to be expressed in most tissues (Saxonov et al., 2006). Normally CpG islands are kept free from methylation, but in cancer they become hypermethylated that lead to gene silencing (first identified in colorectal cancer) or in other case hypomethylation of CpG sites can lead to over-expression of the oncogenes within cancer cells. At the same time intergenic regions and repetitive elements must be methylated and silenced during normal functioning of the cell and development  but they become hypomethylated in cancer cells. All this can lead to unpredictable activation of genes, overproduction of proteins, turning on of genes expression in unproper time or their silencing that can influence development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Silencing of maternally expressed protein-coding gene Igf2 is implemented by paternally expressed lncRNA AIR (Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele but not the maternal). Epigenetic changes at this locus are associated with Wilms tumour, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Silver-Russell syndrome.  Igf2 is overexpressed in Wilms tumour and loss of imprinting can be observed. Bjornsson with coauthors (2007) showed that loss of imprinting of Igf2  was accompanied by alterations in the differentially methylated region of the H19 gene and epigenetic alterations in Wilms tumors are not widespread, supporting the gene and lineage specificity of loss of imprinting of Igf2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It is inhibiting DNA methyltransferase and can prevent methylation (and silencing) of tumor suppressor genes (or transcription of other genes) or even to activate genes that in complex with other enzymes can lead to apoptosis of tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes of DNA methylation can lead to activation of gene transcription in wrong periods of development, loss of genome imprinting or genome instability, activation of silence regions (LINES and intergenomic regions) all of that can lead not only to changes of epigenome of one individual (development of disease (cancer) or a syndrom) but can affect future generations (long lasting effect). The most effect of DNA methylation can be generated during sensitive period. Sensitive period is the period of time during development when organism (cells) is more subjected to the environment influence that can cause changes of normal development (mutations and abnormalities). Organism is the most sensitive during early stages of development (prenatal period): the most critical abnormalities (incompatible with life) give rise during first 8 weeks when most organs are forming, later changes in organ functions can happend that can lead to different disease and syndroms that can decrease life span. First years of postnatal period also is a sensitive period that can influence life quality and future generations. So treating young patients and people before they get progeny (changes in epigenome of eggs and sperm or embrion during pregnancy) can influence future generations through changes of their epigenomes.  </p></div>
