    <div class="field-value"><p>A CpG island is a region of typically unmethylated CG dinucleotides in higher concentration than expected by chance (a common rule suggests 50% of 200 base pairs or more). When DNA methylation does occur, it is often associated with gene silencing at intergenic regions, repetitive elements, and at CpG islands. Gene promoters are not typically methylated because, by definition, the promoter exists to ensure expression. However, promoters may be subject to hyper- or hypomethylation. For example, tumor suppressor gene promoters may exist unmethylated, thus ensuring oncogenes do not result in tumorigenesis, but hypermethylation may inhibit the suppressor and increase the risk of cancer. On the other hand, hypomethylation of microRNA-21 may occur, which can result in over-expression. MiR21 targets tumor suppressor gene, PTEN, so hypomethylation of miR21 may induce enhanced expression and greater inhibition of tumor suppression.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic intervals tends to be associated with disease processes as this epigenetic state may contribute to genomic instability. For example, repetitive elements such as intercisternal A particles (IAP) may “copy/paste” or “cut/paste” themselves into another part of the genome, producing frame shifts or other disruptions. Methylation of these elements typically prevents such occurrence. In the case of intergenic regions, DNA methylation may silence cryptic promoters or splice sites, either of which may lead to transcription changes if unmethylated. Further, DNA methylation is mutagenic, as when 5-methyl Cytosine converts into Thymine. In CpG islands, where CG dinucleotides exist in high concentrations, this type of sequence alteration may induce disease states by significantly altering post-transcriptional products. Because the effects tend to be genome wide, alterations in DNA methylation at intergenic regions, repetitive elements, and CpG islands are associated with cancers that arise from insertions, illegitimate deletions, reciprocal translocations, and loss or duplication of chromosomes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is a form of epigenetic monoallelic gene expression demonstrating parent of origin specificity and is considered crucial for zygote viability. Methylation of imprint control regions/elements (ICR/Es), sometimes called differentially methylated regions/domains (DMR/Ds), establishes imprinted gene expression regulation during primordial germ cell (PGC) development. For example, the ICR between the Igf2/H19 cluster is typically methylated on the paternal allele, and unmethylated on the maternal allele, which results in maternal lncRNA H19 expression. The lack of maternal imprinting permits binding of a CTCF insulator protein to the maternal ICR, thereby blocking maternal growth factor (Igf2) expression by downstream enhancers, but downstream enhancement of Igf2 expression does occur with the paternal allele. Disease states, such as Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, may occur through epigenetic changes that result in the maternal Igf2 functioning like the paternal allele. Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome may also occur through uniparental disomy, which results when a paternal chromosome 11 pair is inherited, or a single paternal chromosome 11 is duplicated. In the case of Wilm’s tumor, hypermethylation of the maternal Igf2/H19 cluster ICR prevents CTCF insulation, resulting in double the normal dose of Igf2 growth factor, and this over-expression yields neoplastic development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of a class of epigenetic drugs, known as DNA-demethylating agents, that inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Using S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) for a methyl donor, DNMT methylates Cytosine, thus establishing the mitotically heritable epigenetic marks. Hypermethylation of genes regulating proliferation, adhesion and other features of leukemia characterize MDS, and drugs such as Decitabine demonstrate some treatment success by blocking DNMT function. In the case of DNMT1, methylation occurs de novo but primarily in response to hemimethylated CpG dinucleotides, which indicates Decitabine has greatest action with clonally induced changes. Though global hypomethylation is a characteristic of some forms of cancer, CpG islands often experience greatly enhanced DNA methylation concentration, including leukaemia. Taken together with increased DNMT activity in some neoplastic tissues, inhibition of DNA methyltransferase by Decitabine may be a good choice in some MDS patients.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike critical periods in development, which typically start and finish abruptly, sensitive periods arise slowly, passing through a period of greatest environmental influence, and then slowly diminish. In neuroscience, periods of greatest sensitivity exist due to nonlinear synaptic pruning and remodeling of disparate cortical regions, at different rates and times, as myelination advances differentially across the neocortex. Behavioral phenotypic plasticity is established by the primate brain’s unparalleled malleability, and any source of expression regulation modulation will yield an effect, whether resulting in neurotypical growth or psychopathology. If the change in epigenetic regulation is due to DNA methylation, this may have lasting effects as this type of epigenetic mark forms by a carbon-carbon covalent bond, and DNMT1 will maintain these marks through each successive mitotic division unless actively demethylated through hydroxylation by TET. Inhibition of DNMT1 can result in global demethylation passively through several mitotic divisions, but changes to cellular metabolic activity may induce disease states prior to cell division. Because drugs capable of removing DNA methylation do so in a global manner, and the effect is lasting, their use during sensitive periods of development may result in aberrant neuropsychological outcomes through activationn of typically silenced genes.</p></div>
