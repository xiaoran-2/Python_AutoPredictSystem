    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, DNA methylation occurs at CpG islands. Methyl groups are added to cytosine residues on both strands of DNA. These methyl groups are laid down by DNMT3a and DNMT3b in mammals. CpGs cluster together into islands and are usually found at gene promoters. Methylation at these islands results in gene silencing. Hypermethylation at these islands may silence tumor suppression genes. Such hypermethylation can be one of the hits that can tranform a cell into a tumor cell. Hypermethylation occurs in most tumors. The suppression of such tumor suppressor genes allows the cells to grow and multiply faster than its counterparts. Eventually, such tumor cells take over which leads to cancer in a well established manner. In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. DNA methylation of intergenic regions promotes genomic integrity. DNA methylation of repetitive elements silences them and prevents their expression which would destabilse the genome . In cancer, both the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated which results in tumor cells having genomic instability. These cells tend to have chromosomal recombinations and transcolations where it should not occur. This contributes to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinted control region of the H19/lgf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the paternal allele. The ICR is paternally imprinted. H19 is produced by a non coding RNA and is produced from the maternal allele. The unmethyllated maternal ICR allele is bound by the insulator protein CTCF which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhances. The enhancers act on H19 and enhances its expression on the maternal allele. Thus Igf2 is not expressed on the maternal allele. On the paternal allele where the ICR is methylated, the CTCF does not bind and the enhancers are free to act on Igf2. They promote the Igf2 expression from the paternal allele only. When the H19/lgf2 cluster is over methylated, imprinting is lost and there is high permethlyation of the ICR on the maternal allele. Igf2 is also expressed from the maternal allele and this results in a double dose of Igf2. As Igf2 is growth promoting, this contributes to disease as growth promoting is associated with Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNMTi class of epigenetic inhbitors. Decitabine are nucleoside analogs which gets incorporated into DNA during replication. When DNMT comes along to bind the decitabine, it is bind irreversibly and it cannot be released. This tends to affect cancer cells that replicate fast which results in the cancer cells being killed. Thus decitabine has an anti tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>We should not treat patients during sensitive periods because treating patients during sensitive periods may have unknown epigenetic effects that may affect the patient and her descendants.</p></div>
