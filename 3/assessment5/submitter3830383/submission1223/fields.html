    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the process of adding a methyl group to a cytosine nucleotide.  Methylation of DNA at CpG islands, which are often found in gene promoter regions, can silence the expression of specific genes.  This allows for tissue specific gene expression which allows for embryonic development.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated and thus silenced.  Hypermethylation of CpG islands can prevent transcription factor binding or result in a repressive chromatin structure.  Each of these states means a gene will not be active.  If the inactive gene happens to be a tumour suppressor gene, this inactivity may lead to development of cancer</p>
<p>The function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity.  DNA methylation at intergenic regions prevents chromosome deletions, insertions, duplications, and reciprocal translocations.   Methylation at intergenic regions also silences cryptic promoters which can interfere with the transcription of normal promoters. </p>
<p>Methylation of repetitive elements prevents transposition by silencing strong promoters in the LTR region which are needed for the expression of proteins, gag and pol, required for transposition.  Methylation of LTR’s also prevents inappropriate downstream transcription of genes that should not be expressed. </p>
<p>Hypomethylation of DNA is also found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer and also results in genomic instability.  Genomic instability due to hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements manifests itself with increased chromosome deletions/insertions; illegitimate recombinations due to open chromatin structures that are normally closed due to hypermethylation</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region (ICR) of the paternal allele is methylated which prevents CTFC, a transcriptional repressor, from binding such that there is no insulating effect on Igf2.  Enhancers are free to promote expression of Igf2.  The methylation pattern of the paternal allele means Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>The imprint control region (ICR) of the maternal allele is unmethylated and is bound by CTFC.  CTFC ‘insulates’ Igf2 from downstream enhancers preventing the expression of Igf2.</p>
<p> Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 region results in expression of the Igf2 gene from both the maternal and paternal alleles.  Igf2 is involved in growth and development primarily before birth.  Loss of imprinting for Igf2 is associated with Wilm’s tumor.</p>
<p> In Wilm’s tumor a loss of imprinting is seen.  Both the maternal and paternal alleles are methylated.  This results in the expression of Igf2, a growth promotor, from both the maternal and paternal alleles resulting in a double dose of Igf2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an anticancer drug that belongs to a class of demethylating agents.  Decitabine works by inhibiting the action of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT).  Tumour suppressor genes and other genes that regulate cell growth are turned off when their promoters are hypermethylated.  This can lead to cancer.  Decitabine treatment results in removal of methyl groups on hypermethylated promoters, restoring normal gene function.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have lasting effects because epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable.  They are passed on during cell division (mitosis). However, some epigenetic changes are reversible with the use of drugs such as the FDA approved DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors.  Baylin hypothesized that treatment with a combination of histone deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine may have changed the tumor cells in a way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of development where epigenetic reprogramming occurs.  Epigenetic marks are removed for a period of time before they are then restored.  These are the pre-implantation and early development period and primordial germ cell development periods. </p>
<p>Treating patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation and histone acetylation during sensitive periods could alter the DNA methylation patterns required for normal development.  These drugs are counterindicated for pregnant women due to the possible toxic effects on the developing fetus.</p></div>
