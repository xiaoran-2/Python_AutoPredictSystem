    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, when cells are functioning the way they ought to, methylation is not noted at CpG islands, although repetitive elements are methylated. In cancer, the phenomenon that occurs is sort of the opposite – the CpG islands are more methylated than a normal cell, and introns, repetitive elements, and intergenic elements are less methylated. In a regularly functioning cell, CpG islands work as tumor suppressor genes. However, when these tumor suppressors are inactivated in cancer cells, and since this DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, a cell with relatively unmethylated CpG islands has a competitive advantage, becomes selected for, and invades surrounding tissues – basically what the disease of cancer is. In addition, normally DNA is methylated at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, but in cancer this DNA is hypomethylated, or under-methylated. When DNA is hypomethylated at repetitive elements, cells begin to lose genomic stability. The resulting issues include many chromosome disorders, such as translocations, and these disorders then disrupt functioning genes; furthermore, these repeats can copy themselves, place themselves elsewhere in the genome, and cause more problems. Cancer is often a product of dysfunctional genes and genomic instability. Hypomethylation in intergenic regions also causes incorrect alignments and illicit recombinations, increasing genomic instability and reducing normal gene functionality. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the example of a normal situation discussed in the video lectures, the H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. When the cluster is unmethylated (the maternal allele, in this case), the insulator element CTCF4 can bind, meaning Igf2 will be silent and not expressed. On the other hand, the enhancers can operate on the paternal allele since CTCF is not binding to insulate it – Igf2 is therefore expressed; but when there is hypermethylation (both alleles are methylated), Igf2 is expressed from both alleles. Thus, there is double the amount of growth promoting element than there is in a regular cell. This promotes an excess of cell growth and can result in something like Wilm’s tumor. Disrupted imprinting like this, because it causes extra cell growth, can also lead to a cancerous tumor forming.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent (also known as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor), so it reduces or removes extra methylation marks. According to the Economist article and the lectures, many cancers, especially those of the immune system, are caused by overactivity of methylating agents – these agents methylate extra histones and end up silencing some incorrect genes, including tumor-suppressor genes. This leads to cancer, uncontrolled cell growth. Decitabine, by demethylating the unnecessarily-methylated parts of DNA, can restore the activity of tumor-suppressor genes and other genes that were incorrectly methylated at first, thus consequently restoring controlled growth and proper functionality in a cell. In addition, the cancer cells divide rapidly, so restoring them to normal function will increase the count of normally-functioning cells. Decitabine also targets rapidly-dividing tumor cells. All of Decitabine’s functions have an anti-tumor effect, as described above.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, epigenetic changes induced by drugs can be passed on through cell division to daughter cells for many generations, altering every cell’s response to therapy. In this manner, DNA methylation, an epigenetic change, can have enduring effects on the genome. However, while these kinds of drugs may inhibit cancer’s spread greatly, we have to keep things in mind before using such therapies. A sensitive period refers to a period of time where a change in the environment can greatly affect epigenetic makeup since cells are susceptible. Using these epigenetic-modifying drugs should be avoided during sensitive periods, especially for younger patients that have germ cell development ongoing, since an error caused by these drugs can not only drastically affect the patient, but it can also affect the patient’s offspring. In case something does go wrong by using a drug in a sensitive period, the epigenetic modifications will affect many cells and be passed down in a long lineage, creating more problems for the patient. Sensitive periods include the primordial germ cell development phase up to development of mature germ cells as well as the pre-implantation and early post-implantation phases.</p></div>
