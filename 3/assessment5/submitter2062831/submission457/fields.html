    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the 5' group of cytosins within the CpG islands are sometimes methylated. Because CpG islands are usually found in gene promoters, when methylated it means that the genes associated with these promoters are silenced. Methylated CpG islands are either found in heterochromatins or prohibit the binding of transcription factors in eucromatins. However, generally CpG islands are protected from methylation in order to allow genes to be expressed. Methylation of CpG islands in heterochromatins, also prevents illegitimate recombination between repeats.</p>
<p>On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. This is in order to maintain  the genomic integrity, i.e. prevent deletions, insertions and translocations. For example, DNA methylation of repetitive elements prevents transposition of the genes found between the repeats into other parts of the genome, thus reducing the risk of gene mutations. </p>
<p>In cancer cells, these patterns are reversed, i.e. hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters, intergenic regions and repetitive elements  and hypermethylation of CpG islands are observed. As a result, silence of genes such as growth suppressors, activation of oncogenes and genomic instability (e.g.actiavtion of repeats and transposition, illegitimate recombination)  are common characteristics of cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes exist in clusters and their exression is controlled by methylation of the Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs) of DNA. When ICRs are methylated on the paternal chromosome, the cluster is paternally imprinted and when the methylation is on the maternal chromosome it is maternally imprinted. Methylation in this case is not synonymous to gene silencing.</p>
<p>The H19/ Igf2 cluster of genes is paternally imprinted. It consists of the Igf2 gene, the ICR, H19 gene and some enhancers found in that order. H19 encodes for a long non-coding RNA and Igf2 is a growth promoter.</p>
<p>The lack of methylation on the maternal ICR means that an insulator protein (CTCF) can bind on it and insulate the IGF2 gene from the enhancers located downstream the H19 gene. Therefore the enhancers act on H19 and this gene is expressed instead of Igf2.</p>
<p>The methylation of the ICR on the paternal allele blocks CTCF from binding and the enhancers can now act on Igf2 and promote its expression. At the same time methylation spreading to the H19 promoter prevents it from being expressed.</p>
<p>When the maternal allele behaves like the paternal one (displays ICR methylation), Igf2 is upregulated and the patient is predisposed to embryonic tumors (such as Wilm's tumour in kidney) among other symptoms.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, i.e. it inhibits DNA methyltransferase in replicating cells when used in low doses (in high doses they are toxic and non-effective).</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleocide analog which is incorporated into the DNA during DNA replication. When methyltransferases bind on those analogs in order to copy the methylation pattern to the daughter DNA strands they cannot be released. Therefore, methylation of DNA is inhibited. Because the most rapidly replicating cells are the canceorus cells, these are the cells that are more severely affected by this type of drugs.</p>
<p>The actual mechanism of action and the longterm effects onnormal cells are not currently known.</p>
<p>DNA demethylating drugs, such as decitabine are currently approved for treating myelodysplastic syndromes that can lead to myelogenous leukaemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drugs that may alter DNA methylation patterns don't act on specific cells only, e.g. cancer cells only, but rather affect all cells in an organism. If they are applied during a period sensitive for epigenetic reprogramming, then their consequences may affect the following generations as well (environmental effects).</p>
<p>The term "sensitive" refers to periods of epigenetic reprogramming (early embryonic development and premodial germ development) or slow growth periods when the germs cells are still maturing (9-12 years old for boys and 8-10 years old for girls). Finally, women at a peri-conceptual period are also considered to be at a sensitive period for epigenetic alterations through the environment.</p>
