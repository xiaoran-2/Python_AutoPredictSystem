    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are generally found in gene promoters. Often they are unmethylated. If they are methylated then the gene is silenced. If they are unmethylated the gene can be expressed or not.</p>
<p>In cancer there is an increase in CpG island methylation. This leads to silencing of the genes involved, many of which are tumour suppressor genes. The silencing of a tumour suppressor gene allows the tumour to grow.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements CpGs are frequently methylated. This prevents inappropriate expression. In can also help to keep chromosomal regions heterochromatinised and reduce the expression of neighbouring genes by making them inaccessable.</p>
<p>In cancer, the methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is reduced. Repetitive elements may contain virally derived strong promoters. If these are activated by demethylation this can lead to expression of downstream genes that are not normally expressed. Demethylation of intergenic regions can lead to the use of cryptic promoters and so to inappropriate expression. This could be expression of genes that are normally silent, or it could lead to the use of a different start site and an abnormal gene product.</p>
<p>In addition, a global reduction of methylation may affect nuclear architecture. Regions which were closed may become accessible to transcription and therefore expression of genes that are normally silent, including oncogenes. Finally, the greater accessibility of the chromatin can lead to genetic instability with a greater chance of inappropriate chromosomal crossing over and rearrangement.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At the paternal allele of the H19/IGF2 locus, the imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated. This methylation spreads to the H19 promoter so that H19 is silenced. The methylated ICR does not bind the CTCF insulator protein. Therefore, downstream enhancers can act on the IGF2 promoter, and IGF2 is expressed.</p>
<p>At the maternal allele of H19/IGF2, the ICR is unmethylated and binds CTCF. Thus the IGF2 gene is insulated from the downstream enhancers, and IGF2 is not expressed. Instead the enhancers act on their less preferred target of the H19 promoter, and H19 expression is enhanced.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour the imprinting is disrupted. This can be by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) with loss of the maternal allele, or by de novo methylation of the ICR of the maternal allele. This de novo methylation of the maternal ICR may not be sufficient to relax imprinting, and a second differentially methylated region covering IGF2 exons 2 and 3 may additionally be maternally hypomethylated. (Oncogene (2002) 21, 5400-5413)</p>
<p>Whichever mechanism operates, the cancer has a paternal pattern of methylation, resulting in silencing of H19 and overexpression of IGF2. IGF2 is mitogenic and growth promoting so supports tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi)</p>
<p>It is a nucleoside analogue, and is incorporated into newly synthesised DNA in dividing cells. DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) copies methyl marks to the newly synthesised strand, but where decitabine is incorporated, DNMT becomes irreversibly bound. </p>
<p>The action of dectabine is therefore division dependant and only dividing cels are affected. As cancer cells divide more than most cell types this provides a level of targetting. </p>
<p>Decitabine is FDA approved for MDS that has progressed to AML. MDS is a tumour in which high CpG island methylation is a poor prognostic indicator, and it may be dependant on hypermethylation at tumour suppresssor genes (TSG).</p>
<p>The exact mechanism of action is unknown. Maybe DNA methylation is not transferred to the daughter cells and so gene repression is relieved, or maybe division is slowed or prevented in heavily methylated cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Therefore any changes made during treatment would persist for the lifetime of the treated cells and also in any cells derived from them.</p>
<p>There are two periods in the mammalian life cycle in which epigenetic marks are erased and reinstated. These are during gamete formation, and during early embryogenesis. These are the sensitive periods. </p>
<p>The sensitive periods would be during pre-implantation and early pregnancy where the epigenetic marks are laid down for the developing foetus, and also at any time when germ cell formation is occuring. Broadly this could be any time before reproduction occurs, although pre-puberty may be particularly sensitive.</p>
<p>It would be inadvisable to use epigenetic therapies during sensitive periods because the inappropriate laying down of epigenetic marks could have profound effects on the development of an early embryo, or the product of a pregnancy from affected germ cells.</p></div>
