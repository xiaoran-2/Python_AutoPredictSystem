    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation decreases throughout the genome (global hypomethylation) in cancer, with the exception of CpG islands where the level of methylation increases (hypermethylationin).  Hypomethylation causes chromosome instability and loss of gene imprinting, whilst Hypomethylation of CpG islands leads to transcriptional silencing of oncogene suppressors.</p>
<p>Methylation is a biochemical process that involves covalent addition of a methyl group to cytosine. at the carbon 5 position, methylation  of Cytidine  reduces gene expression.   Its function is to regulate gene expression in cells as they divide and differentiate from stem cells. DNA Methylation also supresses endogenous retroviral genes and other harmful stretches of DNA that has been added to genome. It is involved in gene imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation. DNA Methylation impedes binding of transcriptional factors and at CpG islands facilitates binding of recruitment proteins which regulate histone acetylation and influences chromatin remodelling.</p>
<p>Intervening regions are non coding regions of DNA between genes that on occasions regulate nearby genes. Theymay contain promoters and enhancers, which may be silenced in cancer due to methylation.</p>
<p>Repititive elements are sequences of DNA which are repeated through the genome. If at ends of DNA they are termed terminal repeats. Else they are tandem repeats, if next to each other (e.g. DNA satellites) or interspersed repeats (e.g. Transposing, SINEs and LINEs). Methylation of Repititive elements may be lost early during cancer and may predispose cells to gene rearrangements.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in DNA methylation levels may have enduring effects on epigenome because they are passed to daughter and granddaughter cells during cell division, until such a time they are actively erased (or inactivated through hydroxylation). Sensitive periods are periods during which epigenetic reprogramming occurs, e.g. durig zygote formation. It is believed that in general during early life (e.g.good. Early cildhood) is a period during which there is enhanced sensitivity to epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. During this period administrating drugs to patients may negatively influence epigenetic composition of genome and normal development (e.g. Brain plasticity).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is a non Mandelian inheritance phenomenon whereby genes are expressed in a parent of origin dependent manner. Imprinted alleles are silenced, by DNA Methylation,  such that non-imprinted genes are inherited exclusively from mother (e.g. H19 expression of long non coding RNA) or father (e.g. Igf2 expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 ). </p>
<p>Wilm's tumor is a former of cancer of the kidney that affects children. In this type of cancer H19/Igf2 imprinting is relaxed such that both H19 and Igf2 are expressed biallelically (both maternal and paternal alleles are expressed). Pathologic disruption of H19/Igf2 imprinting seems to result in acquisition of paternal epigenotype. Epigenetic inactivation of H19 seems to occur in this type of cancer.</p>

    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:

    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a Cytidine analog. It is a DNA hypomethylating drugs that does so by inhibiting the enzyme DNA methyltransferase. It is capable of being incorporated in DNA Strands rendering it cytotoxic. It is used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). </p>
