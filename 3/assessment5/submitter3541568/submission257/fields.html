    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands, which are often found in promoter regions of genes, tend to be protected from methylation.  However, when CpG islands are methylated, the genes under the control of that promoter can no longer be transcribed and are thus silenced.  In cancer, some CpG islands have been found to be hypermethylated, causing silencing of the genes under the control of those promoters.  If those CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, the lack of expression of tumor suppressor proteins can lead to unregulated cell proliferation and tumor formation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in the genome tend to be methylated to prevent expression, to help prevent recombination between repeat regions, and to prevent transposition.  In cancer, these intergenic regions and repetitive elements have been found to be hypomethylated.  This can cause genome instability in the forms of illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats or transposons, and activation of cryptic promoters.  Overexpression of genes (especially oncogenes) or activating genes or promoters that aren’t normally expressed can lead to excessive cell proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele is methylated at the imprinting control region (ICR) and at the H19 promoter, preventing CTCF binding to the ICR.  This allows downstream enhancers to access the Igf2 gene, allowing it to be expressed.  Thus, in normal cells, Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.  In contrast, the maternal allele is not methylated at the ICR or the H19 promoter.  CTCF can bind to the ICR, allowing the enhancers to access the H19 promoter, causing its expression but preventing the expression of Igf2.  Thus, Igf2 is not normally expressed from the maternal allele.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, there is a loss of imprinting due to hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele.  The maternal allele now acts like the paternal allele.  The enhancers access the Igf2 gene, allowing its expression.  Because both the maternal and paternal alleles both are expressing Igf2, there is overexpression of this insulin-like growth factor.  This is one of many imprinted genes involved in growth, and overexpression of such growth factors can lead to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) approved for myelodysplastic syndrome that will lead to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that is incorporated into DNA during replication.  When DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs) bind to attach methyl groups to the DNA, they irreversibly bind to the altered DNA, thus preventing additional methylation.  They are, therefore, replication-dependent.  Because cancer cells divide often, Decitabine acts strongly on them.  If the cancer cells are prevented from dividing, the mutations or epimutations cannot be passed on mitotically, preventing tumor formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, altering the methylation state of DNA will continue to affect the epigenome of all daughter cells produced in subsequent cell divisions.  A sensitive period is a period during development when epigenetic reprogramming occurs.  After fertilization, there is genome-wide demethylation except in imprinted genes and repeats, and during gametogenesis, parental imprints are erased and reestablished.  These periods are sensitive because, as epigenetic marks are removed, environmental changes can cause errors in the restoration of these marks.  Treating patients with DNA methyl transferase inhibitors or histone deacetylase inhibitors during these sensitive periods can disrupt the normal reestablishment of DNA methylation and histone acetylation in stem cells or germ cells.  Thus, it would be inadvisable to treat younger patients who are still developing or still producing gametes with such drugs.</p></div>
