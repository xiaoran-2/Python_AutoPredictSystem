    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation usually functions at CpG islands in promotors to silence genes - however, in normal cells these CpG islands tend to be unmethylated. In cancer cells CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, resulting in silencing of tumor supressor genes and contributing to abberent growth of the cancer.</p>
<p>By contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated in normal cells but are hypomethylated in cancer cells. This contributes to genomic instability (deletions, insertions and translocations) because the methylation at intergenic regions usually prevents illigitamate combiniation between repeats by ensuring that the chromatin is tightly packed as heterochromatin. However, in cancer cells, these hypomethylated intergenic regions exist as euchromatin, which predisposes to genomic instability. This increased genomic instability contributes to disease by increasing the mutation rate and the rate at which the cancer cells lose their normal functions and progress to invasive, metastatic cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region (ICR) of the paternal allele is usually methylated, allowing Igf2 expression. The ICR on the maternal allele is usually unmethylated which allows CTCF to bind, which insulates Igf2 from expression and results in H19 being expressed instead.</p>
<p>This imprinting is disrupted in Wilm's tumour because of hypermethylation; both the materanal and paternal alleles are methylated, resulting in expression of Igf2 from both the maternal and paternal chromosome. There is therefore twice as much Igf2 expression and Igf2 is a growth factor, promoting cell growth - thus resulting in a more aggressive cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabineis a DNA demethylating agent, which removes methyl groups from DNA. This would have an anti-tumour effect because CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated in cancers and by removing this methylation, would allow tumour suppressor genes to be expressed again.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs can have enduring effects on the epigenome ebcause once epigenetic marks such as methylation are established, they are then maintained by enzymes such as DNMT.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods during development when the animal's epigenetic marks are most sensitive to the environment. These are the periods where the animal's epigenetics are actively remodelled i.e. (1) Primordial germ cell (sperm and egg) development and (2) Pre-implantation and post-implantation periods.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods (e.g. younger patients who may be pregnant or still ahve developing germ cells) would be inadvisable as it may lead to excessive epigenetic remodelling of those germ cells/early embryo and adverse outcomes for the patient's children.</p></div>
