    <div class="field-value"><p>Cells require DNA methylation for proper embryogenesis and development, sustaining chromosomal stability, telomere length and the status of gene expression.  DNA methylation is laid down by methyltransferases (DNMT3a and 3b) to permanently silence genes in mammals, is mitotically heritable and is maintained during mitosis by DMNT1.  DNA methylation occurs at cytosine-preceding-guanine (CpG) islands (usually unmethylated), and intergenic regions and repetitive elements (both usually methylated).  Repeats have the capacity to make a copy of themselves and jump around the genome or transpose, but when silenced by methylation, this cannot happen.  However, DNA methylation, almost exclusively at cytosine is mutagenic by CpG dinucloetide being involoved in one-third of point mutations.  But by keeping CpG islands  unmethylated, normal cells keep open clear pathways for gene expression.</p>
<p> DNA methylation at intergenic regions silences transposition start sites or cryptic splice sites.  DNA methylation at repetitive elements, in silencing these repeats also prevents transpositions and transcriptional interference from stray promoters, and possibly prevents illegitimate recombinations.</p>
<p>The above pattern in normal cells is commonly reversed for cancer cells.  This change of methylation pattern (epigenetic) is more common than DNA mutation (genetic), with the implication that epigenetic cancers may be reversible with appropriate drug therapy.</p>
<p>Passive demethylation is a dilution of DNA methylation which occurs with every cell division, when DNMT1 is not expressed or by enzymatic removal via intermediates such as TET proteins.  Thus this cause of cancers increases with age.</p>
<p>Cancer is uncontrolled reproduction of cells.  Abberent methylation marks are maintained during mitosis and thus the malignant cell keeps reproducing.  Cancer is the result of either activation of oncogenes or suppression of tumor suppressor genes, or both.  </p>
<p>CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP) give rise to  cancers, particularly colorectal and breast cancers, where sets of genes are methylated.  Hypermethylated CpG islands differ by tumor type.  CIMP is typified by older and predominatly female patients, and often defective MLH1 (mismatch repair gene).  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Both alleles have the following structure; Igf2 gene-methylation site-ICR for H19-enhancers.  The paternal allele has the methylation site methylated, and the ICR (imprint control region) methylated; the maternal allele is unmethylated and has the CTCF insulator protein attached to the methylation site prior to the ICR.  </p>
<p>In the paternal allele, methylation of the ICR prevents CTCR binding.  So with no insulation, the enhancers are free to encourage Igf2 expression.  By either heterochromatin spreading or DNA methylation spreading to the H19 promoter, it is silenced.  </p>
<p>Lack of methylation on the maternal allele allows CTCF to bind, thus insulating the upstream Igf2 gene from the enhancers.  It is also thought that chromatin looping makes Igf2 the preference for the enhancers but with CTCF blocks this then H19 is enhanced.</p>
<p>Genomic imprinting results in monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression of genes.  Only about 150 genes are imprinted in mammals and many of these are involved in growth.  </p>
<p>With hypermethylation of ICRs occurring in cancer, the maternal allele may become methylated (loss of imprinting) and both paternal and maternal alleles result in double expression of Igf2 which is a growth promoter - Wilm's tumor may result; tumor of the kidneys in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drug decitabine or Dacogen is used as a demthylation agent, or DNMT1 inhibitor, and is chemically similar to 5-azacitydine.  It was believed that it exerts its antineoplastic effects as the carbon in the 5-position is replced with nitrogen which then cannot attach a methyl group, thus DNA methyltransferase is ineffective, resulting in hypomehtylation.  </p>
<p>In inhibiting DNMT1 (an enzyme which ensures DNA methylation is copied on mitosis) the methylation is degraded on subsequent cell division, and thus finally elimiated.  This has an effect on the cancer as the tumor suppressor gene is then reactivated to counter the rapid division of the cancer cells.  </p>
<p>Recent research reported in LandesBioscience indicates that decitabine has two principle lines of action.  Once inside the cell the drug triggers the proteasomal pathway which degrades the transferase protein/enzyme.  However the drug also appears to have a cytotoxic effect causing cell apoptosis.  It is reported that non-proliferating cells are insensitive to the drug. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation, particularly at CpG islands and imprint control regions (ICRs), switch off genes.  When the DNA is copied for cell division, the methylation mark is mirrored on the second strand by DNMT1.  Thus the methylation mark is mitotically heritable.  If the silenced gene is a tumor suppressor, cancer growth is not repressed.  However, by silencing the action of DNMT1, the site remains unmethylated and the tumor supporessor is turned on.  The drug used in combination was a histone-deacetylase inhibitor - H3K4ac is an active mark turning genes on - a different mechanism but with the same result.  The combined drugs seem to impact solid tumors where single drugs had little effect.  </p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods when epigenetic marks are actively remodelled, such as early development to the blastocyst and during PGC development.  Furthermore, there are brief sensitive periods during tissue-specific differentiation.  Also, as demonstrated in the case of the Overkalix studies 9-12 years old for boys and 8-10 for girls is also sensitive for PGC development, responding to food availability.</p>
<p>During these sensitive periods a disturbance to production of growth hormones like Igf2, or DNA methylation, could change parent-of-origin imprinting or PGC development and thus repress development, so administering these drugs would be inadvisable.</p></div>
