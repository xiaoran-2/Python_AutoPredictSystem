    <div class="field-value"><p>Under most normal conditions, DNA methylation at CpG islands (60% of which are “promoter” regions) is relatively low, which allows the gene that promoter regulates to be expressed as DNA methylation is often (though not always) associated with promoter silencing, and gene repression.  In cancer, as a general rule, DNA methylation is increased in those CpG islands (they are “hypermethylated”), and this often includes CpG islands “shores”, which are the 2 kb regions surrounding those islands.  As a consequence, those islands are effectively silenced, which prevents their genes from being expressed, some of which are tumor-suppressor genes, that are critical for normal cell replication and DNA repair.   With those genes being suppressed, tumors may develop from DNA damage and/or the overexpression of oncogenes (such as MYC).  This pattern of hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer is in contrast to the reduced methylation (hypomethylation) of intergenic regions and repetitive elements associated with cancer.  These intergenic regions and repetitive elements constitute large parts of the genome, and under normal conditios, DNA methylation of those areas helps to preserve genomic stability, preventing illegitimate recombination between repeat regions, preventing activation of repeats as well as transposition, and preventing activation of “cryptic promoters” which can disrupt neighboring genes.  In cancer, a global pattern of hypomethylation is seen, which includes a reduction of DNA methylation in those intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which results in genomic instability and its consequences:  more illegitimate recombination between repeats; activation of repeats as well as transposition, and activation of “cryptic promoters” which can disrupt neighboring genes.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One example where disruption of impriting can contribute to cancer is that of Wilm’s tumor and hypermethylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster.  Under normal conditions, the paternal allele of this ICR is methylated which prevents the insulator element, CTCF, from binding to it, and the downstream enhancers are free to act on the Igf2 gene, causing it to express its growth-promoting protein.   At the same time, normally the maternal allele of Igf2 is suppressed because CTCF insulation prevents methylation at the maternal ICR, which means that the downstream enhancers can work on that region, allowing H19 to be expressed and preventing IgF2 from being expressed.   In the case we are discussing, however, the maternal allele is methylated (that is, there is hypermethylation) at the ICR, preventing CTCF from binding, leading to the maternal allele’s expression of Igf2 as well.   Thus what should have been a monoallelic parent-of-origin expression of Igf2 is now a matter of both alleles expressing Igf2, which can lead to a double dose of this growth-promoting protein, and is associated consequently with Wilm’s tumor.  Further, this hyper or hypomethylation of ICRs is associated with lots of tumors, and evidence suggests that this disruption of imprinting is associated with early stages of tumor growth.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi).  Such drugs work by being incorporated into the genome, and irreversibly binding the enzyme (DNMT) that is required for transferring patterns of DNA methylation from mother to daughter cells (they may also actively demethylate DNA). Using a DNMTi like Decitabine can, therefore, disrupt the pattern of DNA methylation in cancer cells with greater effect than in the more slowly dividing healthy cells; hence, rapidly dividing cells like cancer will be more affected than healthy cells (and this may make them more susceptible to chemotherapy treatments). In addition, DNMTis may actually demethylate DNA as well, and once those marks are removed, they will not be replaced – which means, as the Economist article speculates, “that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.”</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During cell division, enzymes called DNA methyltransferases (enzymes that are involved in adding methyl groups) help to maintain the pattern of methylation marks from mother to daughter cells, so using a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor can alter methylation patterns that are transferred to daughter/granddaughter cells during mitotic division.   DNMTis may also actively demethylate cells, and this effect would also be mitotically inherited.  As a result, even after the DNMTi use is ceased, the granddaughter cells may go on to divide, but with the new methylation pattern since once erased, the parental DNA methylation patterns do not return.  This can ultimately have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment as those cells survive but with the “altered” DNA methylation patterns caused by the drug.  This is particularly true if a DNMTi is used during a “sensitive” period for a cell, which is a period when long-lasting epigenetic marks are being laid down on DNA.  During sensitive periods of development such as during germ cell development, prepubescence, or preimplantation of an embryo, the marks laid down will have long lasting effects on gene and RNA expression.   Hence, cells that are exposed to these drugs during sensitive periods could have permanent effects, which could have negative consequences for long-term health of “normal” cells.</p></div>
