    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is usually associated with gene inactivation. However, when DNA methylation i  found in the promoter of a gene, it can also lead to gene activation. This is why CpG islands, which are usually situated in the promoter regions, they tend to remain unmethylated, independantly from the expression level of the gene. In the case of cancer, CpG islands are found to be aberrantly hypermethylated, which leads to gene silencing. When this occurs in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, these genes become silenced, and in combination with other epigenetic aberrations, this could result into tumorigenesis. In intergenic regions and repetitive elements of a normal cell, however, there tends to be DNA methylation, because it provides genomic stability in many ways, for example by silencing cryptic spilce sites in intergenic regions, or by avoiding gene disruption caused by the transcrition of repetitive elements. In cancer on the other hand, these regions tend to be hypomethylated due to genome-wide hypomethylation. This phenomenon would quite certainly lead to genomic instability, since the strucure of the chromatin in these regions would be loosened and would result to abnormal recombinations between chromosomes, or the repetitive elements would be activated or would activate genes around them, using cryptic promoters. This genomic instability would then contribute to the development of a tumour and together with other epigenetic abnormalities would result into cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the Imprint Control Region is methylated, and therefore the downstream enhancers will activate the Igf2 gene and allow it to express itself. On the other side, the maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster has its Imprint Control Region unmethylated, which allows CTCF, an insulator protein, to bind to it. This protein will insulate the Igf2 gene from the enhancers, and they will then activate the H19 gene instead of the Igf2 one, which will therefore  not be expressed at all. In Wilm's tumour, which is a childhood kidney tumour, the methylation pattern of the maternal allele is changed, while in the paternal allele it remains the same. The Imprint Control Region of the maternal allele is now hypermethylated and the CTCF protein is no longer able to bind to it, leading the enhancers to behave just like in the paternal allele and activate the Igf2 gene. This overexpression of Igf2, which is growth promoting, will result into Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that targets the epigenetic machinery in cancer therapy, and it belongs to the class of the DNMTis, or DNA Methyltransferase inhibitors. Once it is incorporated into DNA, Decitabine binds DNMT1 irreversibly to the parent strand, preventing it from transmitting the DNA methylation to the daughter strand. In this way, DNA methylation is lost through duplication of the DNA, and from generation to generation of cells. This seems to be especially effective in the case of myelodysplastic syndrome, since it is heavily reliant on DNA hypermethylation, but is still in clinical trial for other types of tumour. We think that Decitabine acts mostly through DNA-demethylation, although it is being studied if it uses other mechanisms as well.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>We know that DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is essential for life and development. However, alterations in the methylation pattern in the genome can result to genomic instability, as it is known for the case of cancer. These alterations, once they have happened, can have enduring effects because of their mitotic heritability, which means that every time a cell divides it will carry its epigenetic marks through the next generation of cells. During development, sensitive periods are the periods in which the epigenome of an organism is prone to sustain changes from its environment. Such periods are for mammals during the development of the embryo, and more specifically when epigenetic reprogramming occurs, during the germ cell development and early embryonic development periods, where previous epigenetic marks are cleared off and then established again. Epigenetic reprogramming is also the reason why treating patients during sensitive periods should be avoided. Epigenetic drugs affect the epigenome of all the cell types of an organism, and if used during sensitive periods they could alterate the epigenetic marks of the patient and result into genomic instability with very negative effects on the health of the patient.</p></div>
