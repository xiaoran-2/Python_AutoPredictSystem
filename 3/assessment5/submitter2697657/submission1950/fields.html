    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are usually unmethylated, which is correlated to activation of the gene. Conversely, repetitive elements, introns and intergenic regions are usually methylated in these cells. In cancer cells, on the other hand, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, while repetitive elements, introns and intergenic regions are usually unmethylated. The CpG islands, which are usually methylated in cancer, are generally in the promoters of tumor supressor genes. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, this leads to an epigenetic silencing of these genes. When tumor supressor genes are inactive, the development of cancer is more likely to occur.</p>
<p>Methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions is related to genomic stability. When they are hypomethylated, features like illegitimate recombinations are more likely to occur, and there is the activation of the repeats, which "jump" around the genome, and can and up inactivating or activating other genes. This is the reason why genomic instability is highly correlated to cancer. In normal cells, these features are unlike to occur, since repetitive elements and intergenic regions are heavily methylated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the imprinted control region (ICR) is methylated, unlike in the maternal allele. This means that the CTCF cannot bind and insulate the Igf2 gene from the enhancers, and that the lncRNA H19 is not produced. Since there is no CTCFH19 to insulate the Igf2 from the enhancers, they are free to enhance Igf2 expression (which is their preference). This way, Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>The maternal allele do not express Igf2, because the ICR is unmethylated, allowing for the CTCF to bing. CTCF insulates the Igf2 from the enhancers, which act enhancing the expression of the lncRNA H19.</p>
<p>In some cases, there can be a disruption of Igf2 expression, caused by mutations, deletions or epigenetic disruption. This way, there is the loss of imprinting and both the alleles behave like the paternal allele. Because the Igf2 gene promotes growth, the patients have too much Igf2 and no inhibition of growth. They display fetal and post-natal overgrowth, macroglossia and are predisposed to embryonic and childhood tumors, like Wilm´s tumors, in the kidney.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, and is FDA approved. It is an nucleoside analog, which gets incorporated to the DNA upon replication and binds the DNA methyltransferase irreversibly. The action of decitabine is division-dependent, which affects cancer cells more severely, since they replicate more. In low doses, this drug seems to have a very good anti-neoplastic effect, because the tumors seem to cause DNA methylation, at least in some cases. It is known, for example, that hypermethylation of CpG islands has a poor prognostic outcome for myelodysplastic syndrome. Decitabine does not seem to exert any specific effect, so it probably affects all dividing cells. It is not known yet if this is the only mechanism of action of this drug.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division until they are actively erased, and once they are erased, they do not return. Because of that, if the patient recieves the treatment once, the effects could last beyond the period of drug treatment.</span></p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of development in which there is active remodelling of the epigenome. The first sensitive period is the one of germ cell development, all the way through the production of mature eggs and sperm. The second one is the pre implanted and the early post implantation period. Treating patients in sensitive periods with epigenetic drugs should be avoided, since extremely important epigenetic marks are being established in this periods. Drugs that inhibit the epigenetic machinery could have irreversable nocive effects, either in the individual or in their progeny. So, sensitive periods should be considered very carefully.</p></div>
