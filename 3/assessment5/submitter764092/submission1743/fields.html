    <h1>Submission 1743 from Anon (session_user_id: 8f9d004f77f8fbc3e9365db76bac03096f6ad7bc)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is in the class of drugs that cause hypomethylation (hypomethylisation agent).</p>
<p>Decitabine causes the hypomethylation of DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), which is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of methyl group to DNA base cytosine, which in turn constitutes the laying down of DNA methylation epigenetic mark. By inhibiting this above mentioned process Decitabine decreases the level of DNA methylation. In detail: decitabine is firstly incorporated into DNA and from there it irreversibly binds the DNA methyltransferase enzymes, which in turn renders them inactive.  </p>
<p>Many tumor types have been observed to display hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes, which in turn decreases the expression rate of those genes resulting in the loss of control over cell growth and division. By causing hypomethylation of those promoter areas the normal gene expression rates of tumor suppressor genes will be re-established.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation is mitotically heritable epigenetic mark, which makes it enduring – the DNA methylation pattern is carried over to daughter cells after cell division. Mitotic heritability of DNA methylation is based on the activity of DNMT1 enzyme that maintains the DNA methylation after DNA replication by methylating the hemi-methylated DNA.    </p>
<p>Epigenetically sensitive periods are periods, when epigenetic marks are actively removed and re-established.  </p>
<p>First of such periods is the embryotic development from fertilized egg to epiblast, when germ cell specific epigenetic marks are removed and embryotic / somatic epigenetic marks are established. Second main sensitive period is the embryotic development of primordial germ cells (including paternal and maternal imprinting of genes in germ cells) and their maturation up to the age of puberty.</p>
<p>As described above the sensitive periods are characterized by active removal and re-establishment of epigenetic marks at larger scale. By using drugs that interfere with enzymes of “epigenetic machinery” during those sensitive periods, when those enzymes are especially active my cause widespread alterations in epigenetic programming. Because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable errors occurring of those sensitive periods because of the usage of drugs will be carried over to future generations of cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In maternal allele the imprint control region is unmethylated, which allows the insulator protein called CTCF to bind this domain that allows the H19 promoter region to stay unmethylated, which in turn causes the downstream enhancers to interact with H19 promoter area instead of upstream Igf2 gene. </p>
<p>In paternal allele the imprint control region is methylated, which inhibits the insulator protein CTCF from binding this region. In addition the methylation established in imprint control region spreads downstream direction and this leads to the methylation of H19 promoter, which in turn allows the downstream enhancer to act on Igf2 gene instead of H19 leading to expression of Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm’s tumor the epigenetic change has taken place in maternal allele, where normally unmethylated imprint control region has become methylated and this methylation has also spread to H19 promoter area, which causes the downstream enhancers to act on Igf2 gene as in paternal gene. This leads to the doubling of the dose of Igf2 in cells that is growth promoting gene, which promotes abnormal cell growth and division seen in Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG base pairs are clustered together and those clusters are called CpG islands. CpG islands are mostly located in the promoter regions of genes. The normal function of DNA methylation in CpG islands is the silencing of gene expression either by inhibiting the binding of transcription factors or by attracting the binding of methylated CpG binding proteins that leads to establishment of a repressive chromatin structure, which allows the different genes to be silenced in cell/tissue type specific manner.</p>
<p>In the case of cancer the CpG islands are overly methylated (hypermethylated).  This leads to the suppression of the expression of tumor suppressor genes (the CpG islands of promotor regions of those cells are often hypermethylated in cancers). The underexpression of tumor suppressor genes allows the uncontrolled and abnormal growth and division to take place as seen in cancer.</p>
<p>In normal cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to ensure the genomic stability. This ensures that normal karyotype is maintained between cell divisions. In the case of cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, which leads to diminished genetic stability and abnormal karyotype (deletions or insertions of parts of the chromosomes or cross translocations between chromosomes). Genetic instability disrupts the genes and leads to abnormal expression genes – normally silent genes may become expressed and <em>vice versa, </em>which contributes the genetic instability seen in cancer cells that gives those cells a selective advantage over normal somatic cells.</p></div>
