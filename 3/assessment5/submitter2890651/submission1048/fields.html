    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>The global level of methylation <strong>decreases over time </strong>going from normal tissue to metastatic tissue<strong>.</strong> Intergenic regions, repetitive regions, CpG poor promoters and ICRs suffer from <strong>hypomethylation </strong>- i.e. decreased methylation. Normally these regions are methylated in healthy cells. Repetitive elements don't align to each other in normal cells and itself because they are <strong>heavily hypermethylated </strong>and <strong>heterochromatinized</strong>. They are too densely packaged by chromatin for recombination to occur. When hypomethylation occurs (most often in repetitive regions) - this might lead to <strong>genomic instability</strong> and cancer. In repetitive regions, reciprocal translocation can occur and they can jump around the genome. </p>
<p><strong style="font-size:14px;">Hypermethylation</strong><span style="font-size:14px;"> occurs frequently in </span><strong style="font-size:14px;">CpG islands surrounding tumour suppressing genes</strong><span style="font-size:14px;"> in cancer. Cancer cells </span><strong style="font-size:14px;">silence</strong><span style="font-size:14px;"> these genes. <strong>Normally</strong> the CpG island surrounding these genes are<strong> not silenced</strong>, so this can lead to disease. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, epimutations that silence tumour suppressor genes are rapidly </span><strong style="font-size:14px;">selected</strong><span style="font-size:14px;"> over other ones. This kind of hypermethylation is often more frequently seen than mutations. Hypermethylation can also be seen at </span><strong style="font-size:14px;">CpG island shores</strong><span style="font-size:14px;"> surrounding these genes. These are regions ~2kb surrounding the CpG islands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">The CpG island hypermethylation can function as </span><strong style="font-size:14px;">single biomarkers</strong><span style="font-size:14px;">when looking for a diagnose or prognose for a patient. For example, if you find cell-free DNA in the blood, this might be an indicator. </span><span style="font-size:14px;">CpG island methylator phenotype (</span><strong style="font-size:14px;">CIMP</strong><span style="font-size:14px;">) are cancers where CpG islands of a set of genes are frequently methylated. </span><span style="font-size:14px;">Hypermethylated CpG islands differ by tumour type.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Hypermethylation of Imprint Control Regions (ICRs)</strong> can mean a loss of imprinting. In cancer cells hypermethylation can occur at the maternal allele, the paternal allele, or both. This can result in double dose - or no dose at all.  </p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">In the<strong> Igf2/H19 cluster</strong>, the ICR is <strong>normally methylated on the paternal allele</strong> and <strong>unmethylated at the maternal allele</strong>. When it is<strong> unmethylated</strong>, like on the normal maternal allele, CTCF will binds an insulator element which will make the enhancers further downstream </span><strong style="font-size:14px;">increase the expression of H19</strong><span style="font-size:14px;">. But the expression of Igf2 will be silenced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">On the<strong> methylated, paternal allele</strong>, the CTCF is not binding an insulator and the enhancers will act on the Igf2 gene instead and<strong> promote the expression of Igf2</strong>, with no expression of H19. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">However, <strong>in cancer tissue</strong>, the maternal allele will be hypermethylated and can not bind an insulator at the CTCF binding site, just like the normal paternal allele, this will lead to </span><strong style="font-size:14px;">decreased expression of H19</strong><span style="font-size:14px;"> (no dose) and </span><strong style="font-size:14px;">increased expression of Igf2 </strong><span style="font-size:14px;">(double dose). <strong>Igf2 is a growth promoting gene</strong>, and having a double dose at this locus will lead to <strong>Wilm’s tumour</strong> which is a childhood kidney tumour. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <span><strong>DNA <strong><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi)</span></strong></strong>, i.e. i<span>t <strong>hypomethylates DNA</strong> by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It is </span>being used with the hopes to <strong>treat </strong><span><strong>myelodysplastic syndromes</strong>. Many cancer types methylates CpG islands surrounding tumour-suppressing genes, silencing them. Decitabine<strong> inhibits these methyl-groups to be further transferred (inherited) to the daughter cells of the replicating cancerous cell</strong>. So the future cells coming from this cancerous cell will hopefully if everything works allow the normal<strong> tumour-suppressing genes to be expressed</strong> once again.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation marks are<strong> mitotically heritable</strong>. If a cancerous cell is subjected to a DNA-demethylating drug and hypomethylates certain important areas of the genome, like tumour-supressing genes, this will be <strong>passed on to every daughter cell</strong> when the cell divides. The daughter cells will have similar epigenomic makeup as the original cell when it divided. </p>
<p>There is a <strong>sensitive period</strong> in regards to the epigenetic makeup of the cell's DNA. This is <strong>after meiosis</strong>, when the maternal and the paternal gamete meet to form a fertilized cell. When this happens a clearing of epigenetic marks will take place in the embryo, called <strong>epigenetic reprogramming</strong>. The second sensitive period is <strong>when the embryo develops its pre-gametes in its gonads</strong>. The pre-gametic cells will undergo <strong>yet another epigenetic reprogramming</strong> and clear the epigenetic marks. During these two sensitive periods, <strong>one should avoid treating pregnant women with epigenetic-altering drugs</strong> as this might have serious consequences for the future baby and/or future grandchildren. We should also think about <strong>avoiding treating children</strong> and young patients <strong>that still have germ cells developing</strong>, as we do not want to disturb the epigenome of their future children.</p></div>
