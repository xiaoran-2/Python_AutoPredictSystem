    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer we see altered patterns of DNA methylation. Normally the CpG island are unmethylated, but in cancer we see an incease in DNA methylation of CpG islands. Most of the time this causes gene silencing and especially in cancer we see silencing of tumor-suppresor genes, which  normally inhibit tumor growth. Another alteration in cancer is the hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which are normally hypermetylated and thus silenced. With the hypometylation the repetitive elements and integenic regions are active and this can cause genomic instability because of the activation of transposons and cryptic promotors. Transposons can activate some genes (oncogenes) and silence others (tumor-suppresors), and the same is true with the activation of cryptic promotors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster we see in normal cells the imprinting of the of the paternal allele and so the insulator can't block the enhancer so the Igf2 gene is transcribed, however the methylation spreads to the H19 gene and silences it. The maternal allele is unmetylated and so the insulator can bind to this region and block the effect of the enhancer on Igf2 so only the H19 gene is transcribed. In Wilm's tumor both ICR are metylated and so the patient receives a double dose of the Igf2 gene which is the cause of cancer, because the Igf2 gene in a growth-promoting factor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine can be used to treat cancer because of its DNMT inhibitory propeties. Because Dectiabine inhibits DNMT the DNA methylations will decrease with progressive cell divisions and so the hypermethylation of CpG islands can be deacreased. This can cause reactivation of tumor-suppresor genes and thus killing the cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has enduring effects on the epigenome because the epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. I would avoid treating patients with such drugs during the sensitive periods because in this phases the epigenetic marks are reprogramed and so any interference with drugs can disrupt this epigenetic rearrangement. Those periods inclue the reseting of epigenetic marks in primordial grem cell development and the pre-implantaton period of the embryo. Treating patients with such drugs can have a profound effect on the levels of DNA methylation after the reprogramming and so this can cause genomic instability and cancer.</p></div>
