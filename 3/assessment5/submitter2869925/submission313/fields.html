    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands of genes are unmethylated or hypomethylated, allowing the genes to be expressed.  In cancer cells, however, the CpG islands are often hypermethylated, silencing the genes.  When the silenced genes are tumor suppressors, then, together with other hits to the DNA (Knudson hypothesis), cancer may result.  Examples of cancers due to hypermethylation of single genes include retinoblastoma (RB), colorectal cancer (MLH1).</p>
<p>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are usually methylated or hypermethylated.  This helps to maintain genomic stability.  In cancer cells, these locations are usually hypomethylated.  This can lead to improper recombinations between repeats and activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters.  These result in genomic instability and mutations such as deletions, insertions and translocations may arise, causing cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is an epigentic mark, which is passed on when a cell divides into daughter (and then granddaughter) cells.  The epigenetic marks copied and passed on through mitosis, until they are actively reprogrammed.  Therefore, alternations of DNA methylation can have enduring effects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Sensitive periods of development are the times when the epigenome is susceptible to environmental signals such as the presence of certain drugs.  </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">These periods include early development and germ cell development.  During these periods, drugs that can affect DNA methylation should be avoided, as they may interfere with the natural, normal genetic reprogramming that is taking place.  Such interference can cause various diseases, and may even be lethal.  So, epigentic drugs should be avoided with women who are going to have babies in the near future, as well as children in their slow growth periods.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Inappropriate methylation (i.e. both hypo- or hyper-methylation) at ICRs (Imprinting Control Regions) may cause overexpression of growth-promoting genes and underexpression of growth-restricting genes.  These disturb the normal regulation of cell growth, and result in excessive cell growth, developing into cancers.</p>
<p>One such example can be found in Wilm's tumor.  The concerned ICR is found near the Igf2 gene.  In normal cells, the maternal allele of this ICR is unmethylated, and the CTCF protein can bind to the ICR.  This suppresses the expression of Igf2.  However, in the paternal allele in normal cells, this ICR is methylated.   CTCF cannot bind to it, allowing expression of the Igf2 gene.  So the Igf2 gene in the paternal allele is expressed.  This is the normal gene dosage: Igf2 expressed in the paternal allele, but not the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele is methylated (i.e. hypermethlated), causing it to act just like the paternal allele: Igf2 is expressed.  This results in double dosage: the Igf2 is expressed in both the paternal and maternal alleles.  Excessive Igf2, a growth hormone, causes excessive cell growth -- a tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>Decitabine is a drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It is a DNMT-inhibitor and works by binding with the enzyme DNMT (DNA methyltransferase), thereby inhibiting it. DNMT is responsible for copying the methylation patterns of newly replicated DNA molecules in dividing cells. Since decitabine represses DNMT, it reduces methylation of DNA in newly divided cells. As cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells, cancer cells are more affected by this drug than normal cells.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thus, when a cancer is caused by the hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumor-suppressing genes, decitabine can counteract this defect.  The drug can reduce the methylation of CpG islands in new daughter cells, thus re-activating the tumor-suppressing genes.  The tumor suppressing genes can then suppress tumor growth, or cause tumor cells to die via apoptosis.  Thus, the drug can potentially stop tumor proliferation.</span></span></p>
