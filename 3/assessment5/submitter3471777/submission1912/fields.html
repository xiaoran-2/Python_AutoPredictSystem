    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands often occur near the promoters of genes. Methylation of CpG islands typically results in silencing of the gene, whereas a gene whose CpG islands are unmethylated is typically expressed.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands and island shores are often hypermethylated, leading to suppression of gene expression. If the gene being suppressed is a tumour suppressor or growth inhibitor, then this can lead to cancer cells being able to grow unencumbered. If the gene being suppressed is responsible for DNA repair, this can lead to further damage to the genome going unrepaired. The amount of methylation at CpG promoters seen in a particular cancer can be used as a prognostic indicator of the cancer's metastatic potential.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated in expressed genes. It is believed that this prevents transcription errors, preventing accidental RNA splicing and promoting genomic stability.</p>
<p>We also see hypomethylation across the genome in general in cancers. This would include hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Reduced methylation of repetitive elements in the genome can lead to genomic instability and increased errors in transcription, such as translocations, deletions, and insertions. If the hypomethylation occurs at a CpG poor promoter, then this can result in activation of a gene that would otherwise be suppressed, such as an oncogene (gene that promotes growth).</p>
<p>As cancer cells evolve, they tend to acquire increasing amounts of methylation at CpG promoters and decreasing amounts of methylation across the genome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally Igf2 displays monoallelic parent of origin-specific expression. The Igf2/H19 cluster is normally heavily methylated on the paternal allele. The maternal allele, however, is normally unmethylated. When the cluster is hypomethylated (as it is on the maternal allele), the imprint control region is able to bind the insulator protein CTCF blocking and the Igf2 promoter from its enhancers. When hypermethylated, the ICR is unable to bind CTCF and the enhancers are able to act on Igf2.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the H19/Igf2 cluster on the maternal allele is abnormally methylated, resulting in a double dose of the Igf2 gene. Since Igf2 is a growth promoter, this can result in cancers, such as Wilm's Tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase) inhibitor. It's use prevents methylation of CpG dinucleatides during cell division. In cancers that have significant hypermethylation of CpGs, the use of Decitabine can reduce the amount of methylation in the cancer cells, potentially re-activating genes that have been suppressed by the hypermethylation in the cancer, particularly tumour suppressing genes and growth inhibiting genes. This leads to a reduced rate of growth in the affected cancer cells. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, meaning that daughter cells will display the same methylation as their parent cells. If a cell's DNA methylation is altered by a drug, then that change in methylation will be carried on to the cell's children, resulting in an effect that endurs after treatment has ended.</p>
<p>While epigenetic drugs can be used outside of the normally sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming, such drugs will have detrimental effects if used during sensitive periods of development. These sensitive periods occur during early embryonic development and during gametogenesis. If a patient is treated with an epigenetic drug during early pregnancy, or conceives during or shortly after treatment with an epigenetic drug, then there is significant risk of introducing epigenetic errors to the developing fetus.</p></div>
