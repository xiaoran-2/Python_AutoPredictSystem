    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the C5 position of the cytosine base in DNA. It occurs almost exclusively in CpG dinucleotides and it is conserved along cellular divisions. Mehtylated CpG dinucleotides recruit proteins such as MeCP1/2, which have DNA-binding domains as well as transcriptional repressing domains; also, these proteins are able to recruit chromatin condensing factors. Since CpG rich regions, known as CpG islands, are usually found in gene promoters, their methylation normally correlates with transcriptional repression. </span></p>
<p>While healthy cells usually keep their CpG islands unmethylated, cancer cells exhibit hypermethylation of these regions, as observed in every type of cancer.  Since DNA methylation is an effective way to suppress gene expression, the principal outcome of this change is that many tumor suppressor genes are silenced. This happens more frequently than silencing via genetic mutations. Among some examples of hypermethylation, the cases of RB in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in rectal cancer, BRCA1 in breast cancer and MGMT in glioma, have been well documented. </p>
<p>Hypermethylation is not the only disruption of DNA methylation observed in cancer: Hypomethylation has also been described. Healthy cells normally keep low methylation levels in CpG islands, but high methylation in repetitive elements and intergenic regions, since these are able to replicate themselves in different regions of the genome and their promoters can remain active in every cell. Thus, silencing of these regions via methylation is relevant for the maintenance of genomic stability. </p>
<p>Tumoral cells exhibit a significant decrease in methylation levels in these regions. The consequences of this change depend on the tumor type: hypermethylation-dependent tumors are not favored by hypomethylation, since it can suppress tumorigenesis. There are, however, several types of tumor that depend on chromosomic instability; in these cases, hypomethylation enhances tumorigenesis. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Another feature of cancer cells is that they exhibit loss of imprinting. This means that genes that should display monoallelic expression become expressed or silent from both parental alleles. Changes in DNA methylation are responsible of these changes via hypomethylation or hypermethylation of imprinting control regions (ICRs).</span></p>
<p><span>A clear example of this process is loss of imprinting at the IGF2/H19 cluster caused by hypermethylation. This locus uses a CTCF-dependent insulator to repress the expression of IGF2 maternally and methylation of the ICR to repress H19 paternally. </span></p>
<p><span>This possible due to the unmethylated status of the ICR on the maternal allele. When this happens, CTCF binds an insulator element and the enhancers act on H19, allowing its expression and keeping IGF2 silent on this allele. On the other hand, in the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and the enhancers can act on IGF2, since CTCF is not bound. Therefore, IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele. </span></p>
<p><span>In Wilm's Syndrome there is loss of imprinting in this cluster: the ICR in the maternal allele is also hypermethylated, resulting in expression of IGF2. Thus, there is a double dose of this growth-promoting gene. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic drugs are based on the reversibility of epigenetic alterations and are often targeted at enzymatic epigenetic modifiers. Decitabine, or 5-azadeoxycytidine, is a DNMT inhibitor used for treatment of myeloid-type cancers. It acts by binding to DNA, where it is recognized by DNMTs as a natural substrate. The chemical structure of the compound allows it to trap the enzyme via a covalent bond, blocking its methyltransferase function. This also triggers DNA damage signaling, which in turn will result in the degradation of trapped DNMTs. As a consequence, methylation marks are lost during replication. </span></p>
<p><span>This demethylation effect means that DNMT inhibitors can have anti-tumor effects by reversing DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands featured in cancer cells. However, effects on healthy dividing cells is still unknown. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is a clear example of mitotic heritability of an epigenetic mechanism, due to its transmission along cellular divisions: when the cell divides, the new cells contain a parent strand, which maintains the methyl groups added by DNMT3a and DNMT3b; they also have a daughter strand, which contains unmethylated dinucleotides. Thus, DNA in daughter cells is hemi-methylated. DNMT1 recognizes hemi-methylated DNA and restores methylation patterns by adding the necessary methyl groups to the daughter strand. </span></p>
<p><span>Environmental changes can influence the epigenetic state during sensitive periods.</span><span> One of them is the phase of primordial germ cell development, which goes through the production of matures gametes. The second period lasts from the pre-implantation phase to the early post-implantation of the embryo. DNA methylation undergoes massive changes during these phases, as it is extensively erased and then new methyl marks are established along many states, extending through sexual maturity. </span></p>
<p><span>Given that these periods are extremely susceptible to environmental influences, treatment with DNMT inhibitors are inadvisable. These drugs could disrupt the normal process of epigenetic reprogramming by trapping the enzymes involved in the establishment of new methyl marks. This could have deleterious effects on the phenotype. </span></p>
