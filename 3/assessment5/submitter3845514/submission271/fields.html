    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell CpG islands are hypomethylated, allowing the transcription of the adjacent gene. In cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated, silencing the expression of the gene. The genes most commonly silenced via CpG hypermethylation are tumor suppressor genes, therefore promoting abnormal cell growth. CGI methylation increases with time and is mitotically heritable. Each type of cancer shows hypermethylation in different CpG islands, which can be used diagnostically, prognostically or therapeutically as a biomarker. On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in normal cells. However, they are hypomethylated in cancer cells, leading to genomic instability. Hypomethylation causes activation of the repetitive elements, thus promoting their replication and transposition. These transposable elements may interfere with the expression (activate or silence), of neighbouring genes. As for intergenic regions, hypomethylation can cause activation of normally inactive (cryptic) gene promoters, leading to abnormal gene expression. It is also true that hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, destabilise these heterochromatic regions, resulting in euchromatin which causes breaks in chromosomes and illegitimate recombination. All of the above are epigenetic contributions to tumorigenesis, on top of genetic alterations. Finally, hypermethylation is a somewhat reversible process, unlike mutations, so it can be the target of new therapeutic agents.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele, so the CTCF cannot reach it. This lets the enhancers act on Igf2 and express it. On the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated enabling CTCF to bind and silence the expression of Igf2. This lets the enhancers act on H19 (which has its promoter unmethylated, contrary to the paternal allele) and express it. In Wilm's tumor (childhood kidney tumor), there is loss of imprinting. Hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele, causes silencing of H19 expression and also aids the expression of Igf2. This results in overexpression of Igf2 (maternal and paternal), which is growth promoting and associated with Wilm's tumor. These events in ICRs happen early in tumorigenesis and are seen in pre-neoplastic tissues.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cytidine analog and it belongs to hypomethylating (DNA-demethylating) class of drugs. At low doses it irreversibly binds with DNA methyltransferase acting as epigenetic inhibitor. At higher doses its is incorporated into DNA strands, showing cytotoxic activity and resulting in cell death. Except for hypomethylating the DNA, it also is shown to make some tumors more susceptible to conventional chemotherapy. It is currently used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. The action of decitabine is division dependent, so it is more selective for cancer cells, which divide more rapidly than normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have various effects on a cell. For example, hypomethylation of CpG islands can lead to re-expression of genes that were previously silenced, as in some cancers. Hypomethylation may also result in less compact chromatin in cancer cells and more repeats interfering with its gene expression. This could aid the action of standard chemotherapy. Although methylation marks are erased during sensitive periods - blastocyst stage of embryogenesis and during primordial germ cell development, changes in methylation of imprinted genes and repeats are long lasting and difficult to erase. It would be wise,not to treat pregnant women with these agents, considering the irreversible effects on the epigenome of the developing fetus. Last, cancer treatment should be administered to children with caution, always considering fertility issues that may arise (epigenetic alterations of gametes).</p></div>
