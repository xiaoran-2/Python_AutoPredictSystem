    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG islands are not/hipo methylated and we see methylation in repetitive elements, intergenic region and intronic regions. In cancer cells the patterns is the opposite and we see more methylation in the CpG islands, but not in the regions mentioned above (or alternatively they are hipo methylated).</p>
<p>DNA methylation serves as a way to silence gene expression, in cancer the suppression can occur in tumour suppressor genes, leading to a tumour cells that are more likely to survive due to increased growth. This alteration in normal functioning is considered as one possible hit of the multiple hits that it are needed to induce cancer (Knudson hypothesis). This tumour suppressor hypermethylation is even more frequent than genetic mutations and confounds with the methylation due to aging.</p>
<p>The methylation at CpG islands increase as there is progression to aggressive tumors and the pattern of methylation depends on tumour type. Besides these, the pattern also correlates to prognosis and responses to therapy.</p>
<p>In the repetitive elements and intergenic regions we have more commonly hipomethilation, leading to genome instability, causing illegitimate recombination between repeats; activation of repeats, transposition and promoters; occurrence of deletions and insertions; and disruption of neighbouring genes. All this can unduce tumour cells or increase pathogenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In this case we have a loss of imprinting, leading to total loss of expression or expression of both alleles (maternal and paternal), resulting in overexpression. The observed occurrence of this phenomenon is explained by the importance of imprinting in the control of gene expression of genes involved in growth, important to the generation of tumour celss. In this situation we can have either hipomethylation or hypermethilation, but for the specific example we are talking about, we have hypermethylation.</p>
<p>In the cluster above, in normal cells and in the paternal allele, there is methylation at the ICR, but not in the maternal allele. This cause CTCF to bind to ICR in the maternal allele and induce the action of the enhancer on the H19 (the Igf2 is silenced). In the paternal allele, the enhancer acts on the expression of the Igf2.  </p>
<p>In the tumour cells we see both alleles hypermethylated, resulting in the increase expression of Igf2. Being related to growth functions the overexpression will result in sustained growth of tumour cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents. It works by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme called EZH2, that methylates DNA.</p>
<p>Indeed, it has been shown that in tumour cells, there may be overmethylation, that results in higher gene silencing that in normal cells. This silencing can have an important impact when they occur in tumour-suppressor genes, resulting in a more likelihood of having an uncontrolled cell growth that can evolve to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The alterations in DNA methylation by drugs, reverting the usual overmethylation in cancer cells can have an enduring effect on the epigenome because epigenetic changes are mitotically inheritable. This means that daughter cells tends to have the same epigenetic state compared with mother cells. In this sense we can assume that cancer cells will lose aggressiveness (growth potencial and other traits) as some silencing is reverted.</p>
<p>These drugs can alter the epigenetic state, but there is a danger in that without having cell selectivity, we can change more than we wish. Particularly, the patients with developing germ cells (younger), where the epigenetic marks and machinery are still evolving, can be considered to be in a sensitive period because the alteration of the normal process, in normal cells, can lead to aberrations in development. The issue is how to revert the epigenetic changes in cancer cells without altering the normal epigenetic processes. This issue is still and will be under very active research in the near foreseable future.</p></div>
