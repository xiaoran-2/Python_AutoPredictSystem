    <div class="field-value"><p>The modification of DNA by methylation is a widespread mechanism for the epigenetic regulation of genomes. It consists in the enzymatic modification of certain cytosine nucleotides at their 5 position by the addition of a methyl group. The modulation of gene expression by DNA methylation is commonly found in normal cells, being present in  most of the CpG islands in promoters of mammalian somatic cell genes. Methylation at these sites usually leads to gene silencing and play a major part in crucial processes like gene imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and the regulation of repetitive elements. However, deregulation of methylation at CpG islands is a major factor in carcinogenesis. The hypermethylation of their CpG islands can silence tumor suppressor genes, which code for proteins that could inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. Moreover, the hypomethylation of CpG sites promotes the over-expression of oncogenes in tumor cells which could lead to the development of cancer. CpG island shores and distal regulatory elements are also kept under low methylation levels in normal cells (e.g., to allow for the binding of tissue-specific transcription factors), thus their hypermethylation in cancer cells could lead to disease. This region-specific increase in methylation in cancer cells contrast with a genome-wide hypomethylation. DNA methylation is also normally found outside genes, especially in satellite sequences of different sizes and related with the LINEs and SINEs retrotansposable repeats. Given their abundance (&gt;30% of human genomes), their extended distribution and their tendency to jump in the genome, which could interrupt the expected sequence of genes, the stability of normal cells requires the maintenance of a high level of methylation that would silence these elements. Hypomethylation of their promoters is commonly seen in cancer cells, with an increased expression activity that leads to mutations, chromosome rearrangements and undesired genome-wide rearrangements. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Gene imprinting is a common mechanism of healthy cells to control the expression of genes in a parent-of-origin manner. The H19/Igf2 locus serves as a typical model to explain imprinting by epigenetic modification by DNA methylation. These two genes are close and their transcription is linked: while H19 is expressed from the maternal chromosome, the paternal allele is silenced; and the opposite is true for Igf2. This highly concerted scheme is helped by a differentially methylated region (DMR) in between both genes and immediately upstream H19. In the paternal allele this region is highly methylated, providing a substrate for a methyl-DNA-binding protein that blocks the action of downstream enhancers, silencing the gene in consequence. These enhancers would instead increase the expression of the distant Igf2 gene. In contrast, the DMR in the maternal allele is unmethylated and can be bound by the CTCF protein, promoting the enhancer-induced transcription of H19 and keeping Igf2 gene silent. An altered epigenetic state related to the H19/Igf2 locus is observed in cancer processes like Wilm’s tumor, where the relaxation of Igf2 methylation at the DMR in the maternal allele causes it to revert to the paternal allele, leading to overexpression of Igf2 and loss of H19, both responsible for abnormal cellular overgrowth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a pyrimidine analog drug in the group of DNA methylation inhibitors. It acts by causing demethylation of repressed promoters of tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells, which are in turn reactivated and could slow the progression of disease. Its mechanism of action involves in particular the formation of permanent covalent bonds with DNMT (DNA-methyltransferases) that could promote its inactivation or degradation. In this way, the abnormal cells can no longer divide, their proliferation is inhibited and cell death could take place. Decitabine can be used for slowing the progress of myelodisplastic syndrome when administer in low dosis, but extreme care should be taken as higher than recommended dosis could be lethal.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The efficacy of standard chemotherapy in cancer must be limited by the genomic and epigenomic diversity of tumor cells. Resistant phenotypes should be characterized by certain epigenetic configurations, with DNA methylations as fairly stable and heritable marks. Drugs targeting epigenetic modifications of this kind have the potential to disrupt the regulation acquired by the resistant cancer cell and, much like an on/off switch, promote the revertion to the chemotherapy-sensitive cell type. Delivery of these drugs, however, should be made with care. Early and adult life, and even offspring life, can be influenced by the epigenetic state established specially during sensitive periods. These could be defined as those stages of development where epigenetic marks are more susceptible to change by external factors. Although the epigenome (DNA methylation, histone modifications and the different kinds of small RNAs) is laid in a critical way and subjected to many regulatory controls, it is not voided from the influence of environmental factors in particular during embryogenesis and the formation of stem cell lineages. Given our incomplete knowledge of the way that long-term epigenetic modifications are modulated, in particular with regard to histone modifications, and given the increased sensitivity of these periods and the long-term consequences of these early treatments, it is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods.</p></div>
