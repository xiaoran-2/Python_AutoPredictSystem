    <h1>Submission 2204 from Anon (session_user_id: cb118a09f48b3fea532c555f69b7701af8acd451)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA methyltranferase inhibitior. It prevents methylation of CpG islands in DNA, leading to reactivation of tumour suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because of DNA methylation is mytotically heritable, effect of DNA MT inhibitors can last on offspring of affected cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is a period of development, when cells are especially vulnerable to enviromental factors, toxic compounds(including drugs), radiation and oter harms.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods include primordial germ cells development, <span class="short_text"><span title="оплодотворение">fertilization</span></span>, implantation of embrio, blastocyst formation.</p>
<p>In sensitive period, epigenetic drugs can cause many development disorders. Even worse, if primordial germ cells formation affected, offspring of this human will have development disorders, even if pationt itself is unaffected.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in CpG islands controls gene expression. In cancer, CpG is hypermethylated, which causes suppression of tumor suppressor. It leads to uncontrollable cell proliferation and/or to impairment of cell differentiation.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions, DNA methylation controls genomic stability through regulating repeats and transposones. In cancer, they are hypometilated, leading to increased number of deletions, insertions and translocations. Effect of this mutations is unpredictable. For our case, suppressed oncogene can be translocated to strong promoter.</p></div>
