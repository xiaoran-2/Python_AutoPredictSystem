    <h1>Submission 19 from Anon (session_user_id: 0845d3921d21fac1acf55b47d4cd3438255e737d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The decitabine belong to the class of DNA Methyltransferases inhibitors, or DNMTi, decreasing the general hypermethylation present in the DNA of the cancer cells. The high methylation is a common characteristic present in many types of cancer and it's associated with the silencing of genes associated of CpG islands, including tumour supressor genes. In the other hand, this silencing of tumour supressor genes can lead the to expression the oncogenes, like EZH2, which hypermethylate histones, leading to the silencing of nearby genes and creating a chain effect: Silencing the tumour supressor genes, what causes the expression of oncogenes, leading to the development of the cancer.</p>
<p>The Decitabine is a drugs that prevents the hypermethylation of the DNA, decreasing it's rate. Because of this, the CpG islands will maintain their integrity, what may safeguard the tumour supressor genes, avoiding the expression of oncogenes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of the methylation in the CpG islands is to control the development of the cell and is unmethylated in the normal cells. In cancer cells, the CpG islands have higher methylation in comparison with normal cells. The disruption of the normal methylation of the genome can lead to the hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumour supressor genes, sequences that inhibits the tumour progression, decreasing their expression, and hipomethylation of CpG islands of oncogenes, genes that promotes the cell growth, increasing their expression, favoring the tumour expansion.</p>
<p>Normally, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated and this is essential to mantain the genomic stability, avoiding events like cromosomal deletions, insertions, translocations and transcription errors, what occurs in cancers, where another chromossome, the "Philadelphia chromosome", is present due to translocations between the chromosome 9 and 22 tipically present in some types of leukemia.</p>
<p>In cancer, the CpG islands are found more methylated and intergenic regions and repetitive elements less methylated than normal cells. This can lead to the development of a tumour because of the genomic instability caused by the translocations and transcription errors caused by the transposons, which can paste themselves over an tumour supressor gene, and repetitive elements, which may induce the expression of an oncogene.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/IGF2 cluster, the ICR of the paternal allele is found methylated, which prevents the bind of the CTCF and lead to the methylation of the H19 gene. The consequence of this is the expression of IGF2. In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, permiting the biding of CTCF, what allows the expression of H19. This causes the silencing of the IGF2.</p>
<p>The Wilm's tumour is signal of predisposition to "Wiedemann syndrome", an disease that may causes the silencing of the CDKN1C gene, which is an tumour supressor gene, and/or the overexpression of the IGF2, which is an oncogene. The inactivity of the CDKN1C causes the expression of oncogenes that should be silenced, inducing the cell to proliferate. A similar effect is present with the overexpression of the IGF2, enhancing the proliferation of the cells, the most basic pathologic trait of the cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic modifications, like methylation, in a cell are passed to the daughter cells after cell division. Because of this, drugs that influence the epigenetic mechanisms affects not only one cell, but all cells produced due to its mitosis, explaining why such drugs have effects after its use.</p>
<p>The sensitive period is when the epigenetic system undergo epigenetic reprogramming. Such periods are the primordial cells development, early development and pre-implantation periods. Changes in these periods influences directly the future generations of the patients, leading to alterations that could compromise the correct growth of the future embryos.</p></div>
