    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally,  CpG islands are mostly unmethylated, which allows for the methylation of other segmets of the genes, especially repetitive elements, and intergenic regions. CpG islands are filled with tumor supressor capabilities protecting the integrity of the genome. </p>
<p>In a cancer cell, frequently but not always, CpG islands get hypermethylated, that they cannot perform their tumor suppressor "duties" creating a hypomethylation in the repetitive elements and intergenic regions. This all shuts down the tumor supressor system and, being methylation mitotically heritable, allows for a system that prevents future generations of that cell from expressing the tumor supressor genes.</p>
<p>As the tumor supressor genes get silenced, mistakes happening in other areas of the cell like the repetitive elements and intergenic regions, are not corrected and hence it creates mutations in cells which are now inherited by the next cells. This makes cancer cells grow, reproduce and eventually metastisize and move on to othe parts of the body.</p>
<p>Methylation of repeats and intergenic intervals helps maintain genomic stability. preventic the genetic sequence from loosing or gaining chromosomes or creating illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes, minimizing any potential harmful mistakes that might arise.</p>
<p>When they become hypomethylated they are easier to access and read. This leads to a wide range of potential issues like illeginitamate recombination of chromosomes. These repeats can also jump arround the genome creating transpositions and interfering with the genetic code all over the cell, this could also activate other genes which have been silenced.</p>
<p>As new mistakes happen which do not get corrected, the genomic instability creates new tumor cells which keep replicating and interfering with other cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent which acts to inhibit DNA Methyltransferase (hence reducing DNA methylation).</p>
<p>Decitabine inhibits the DNA Methyltransferase process, which on one side prevents methylation while causing DNA to become less methylated (hypomethylation) preventing methyl groups to be added to cytosine and adenyne DNA nucleotoides.</p>
<p>As the DNA becomes hypomethylated, it would demethylate the previous methylated CpG islands on cancer cells. This would allow on one part for the tumor supression activity of the CpG islands to return, slowing down or stoping tumor grouth. Also, since the tumor supression genes are now expressed in the cancer cells, it would allow other treatments, such as chemotherapy, to be more effective since the tumor cells would be more vulnerable to attack while fighting the tumor supressor genes inside.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>lgf2 is paternaly imprinted, so it should be methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. On the paternal allele, methylation blocks binding of CTCF insulator protein, without it, methylation expands to H19 blocking it's expression and allows the enhancers to act on lgf2 to activate it. On the maternal allele, the unmethylated ICR allows the binding of CTCF which allows the enhancers to act on H19, prmoting it, but at the same time blocks the enhancers from lgf2 on the maternal side, so it is left deactivated.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the child ICR for H19/lgf2, you get two paternal like alleales and no maternal like alleale. So you get an overexpression of lgf2 which is an oncogene and promotes growth and at the sime time you have no Cdkn1c which inhibits growth.</p>
<p>Since there is an overexpression of lgf2, an oncogene, and a complete supression of Cdkn1c, a growth supressor, it causes uncontrolled growth of cells, which is an ideal scenerio for cancer cells to grow and hence contributes to the formation of tumors (in this case in the kydney).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, meaning that a cell that has been heavy methylated or demethylated in one area, will inherit that methylation patern as it replicates. So any changes in the methylation of one cell, will be inherited by the next, just like cancer cells do it. So if we are able to change the methylation pattern of a cell to overexpress tumor supressant genes, for example, these patterns would be passed on to future cells (including cancer cells).</p>
<p>Sensitive period are the development stages in which a general demethylation occurs to recover totipotency of the genome. Sensitive periods from fertilization to the formation of the blastocyst and further along development in the period when the primordial germ cells are developed.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would have permanent changes to the epigene which would seriously affect development and how genes are expressed as well as being inherited to future generations.</p></div>
