    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells DNA methylation rarely occurs at CpG islands, however there are occasions where CpG islands are methylated such as those involving the inactive X chromosome. DNA methylation at CpG islands is always synonymous with gene silencing. In cancer cells, CpG islands are much more likely to be methylated (hypermethylation) particularly those CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes, so these tumour suppressor genes are silenced. The silencing of tumour suppressor genes may along with other genetic/epigenetic ‘hits’ result in tumorigenesis. Tumour suppressor hypermethylation is frequent in many types of tumours.</p>
<p>Unlike CpG islands, DNA methylation frequently occurs at intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells. The main function of DNA methylation at these locations is to maintain genomic stability. DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to prevent abnormalities such as insertions, deletions and duplications of chromosomes while DNA methylation at repetitive elements is to prevent the transpositioning (jumping) of genes around the genome and to prevent illegitimate recombination between repeats.</p>
<p>In cancer however, both intergenic regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated therefore there is hypomethylation of the genome, which results in a high level of genomic instability. This will involve an increase in chromosomal insertions, deletions and translocations and transpositioning of genes around the gene which will result in tumorigenesis. This aberration of DNA methylation which results in genomic instability and silencing of tumour suppressor genes is a hallmark of cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the imprint control region (ICR) of the Igf2/H19 cluster region on the paternal allele is methylated. Therefore the CTCF insulating protein cannot bind to it and so the downstream enhancers can act on the Igf2 gene, so Igf2 is expressed on the paternal allele. However on the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and so CTCF binds to it, insulating the Igf2 from the enhancers which then act on H19. This results in the expression of H19 but not Igf2 on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>When there is a loss of this gene imprinting it results in hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele so that CTCF cannot bind, therefore H19 is no longer ‘enhanced’ and Igf2 is expressed. This leads to double the normal expression of Igf2 expression as it will be expressed from both the maternal and paternal alleles. This then leads to tumorigenesis (Wilm’s Tumour) because Igf2 is a growth promoter gene, thus when Igf2 is overexpressed it will inappropriately promote the growth of cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug within the class of DNA methyl-transferase inhibitors (DNMTi); it is a DNA-demethylating or hypomethylating agent. It is an FDA approved drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome which has progressed to Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML).This DNMT inhibiting cytosine nucleoside analogue is incorporated into the DNA during DNA replication, and irreversibly binds to the DNMT. This DNMT then cannot transfer the methyl group to the DNA required for DNA methylation. In small doses Decitabine has been shown to have an anti-neoplastic effect. In cancer there is hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes, if decitabine then inhibits this hypermethylation then these tumour suppressor genes can be expressed and function in inhibiting the growth and division of cancer cells. Because decitabine is a DNA replication-dependent drug it should be effective on cancer cells which notoriously divide at a higher frequency than normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation, as an epigenetic mark is mitotically heritable, therefore regions of DNA which are methylated in one particular cell will also be methylated in all of the daughter cells within this cell lineage. So, if a cell is treated with a drug such as a DNMT inhibitor, methylation will be prevented in all of the subsequent daughter cells which replicate from the original treated cell. Therefore, treatment with drugs that alter methylation will have a lasting effect on the epigenome. Yet there are periods of development during which the epigenome is particularly susceptible to alterations in the environment. Examples of such sensitive periods include during primordial germ cell development as well as during the preimplantation and early post implantation periods. These are also periods during which active remodelling of the genome occurs.</p>
<p>Treatment with drugs that alter methylation during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable as there is a chance that transgenerational inheritance of the altered DNA methylation may occur. As DNA methylation is crucial for genome stability, offspring that inherit the altered DNA methylation would be at high risk of diseases such as imprinting disorders, tumorigenesis, germ cell tumours or even early embryonic lethality.</p></div>
