    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a biological process in mammals, is fundamental for some functions like x -chromosome inactivation, supression of repetitive elements, genomic imprintining. Between 60 % and 90 % of al CpGs are methylated, this methylation is an important regulator of gene transcription. The degree of this methylation in the promoter region of the gene affect its expression. In the intergenic regions and the repetitive elementes the methylation is important to conserve the genomic integrity. Silencing of  this elements avoid transposition and transpositional interference from promoters and avoid illegitimate recombinations like deletions or activation of oncogenes (  hypomethylation  in CpG poor promoters ). Chromosomal deltions appears to be  the earliest and most frequent somatic genetic alteration during carcinogenesis, it inactivates a tumor supressor gene by loss of heterozygocity inducing haploinsufficiency, loss of expression (<strong> Leukemia, lymphoma, Prostate cáncer</strong>). When  deletions occur between tandem arrays of duplicated genes ( like the globin families) we can obtain a hemoglobin alteration like in  the case of  <strong>thalasemia.</strong> There are proteins that binds specifically to the DNA methylated , these proteins have a   MDD domain ( methyl-CpG binding domain), short regions of 0.5-4 Kb in length "CpG islands"   are rich in C + G content  and CpG 1 Kb large, frequently localized associated  with proximal regions of genes in the promotor region or first exons, these islands are unmethylated  in the germline ( and most somatic tissues ), ensuring , <strong>some of CpG islands function as strong promoters</strong> proposed to function as replication origins in mammals. 7<strong>0 % of all the genes have a CpG island  asociated, there are specific proteins that binds to this CPG No methylated Islands, this binding site</strong>s<strong> are blocked when this CpG islands are methylated. CpG islands influence chromatine structure</strong> via de CpG binding protein Cfp1.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Insuline like  growth II  factor (IGf2) and H19 genes are imprinted in human with expression of the paternal IGf2 and maternal H19 alleles. Loss of imprinting of IGf2 is associated with 80 fold down regulation of H19 gene expression. These changes  are associated with alterations in parental origen specific, tissue independent sites of DNA methylation in the H19 promoter and loss of heterozygosity allways associated with loss of H19 expression. Imprinting of a large domain of the maternal chromosome, results in a reversal to a paternal  epigenotype. this sugest a epygenetic mechanism for inactivation of H19 as a tumor supressor gene. There´s been identified epigenetic 11p15 abnormalities in 69% of W ilms tumors , 37% weew H19 epimutations and 32 % were paternal uniparental disomy ( p UPD). Wilms tumor is genetically and epigenetically heterogeneous, abnormalities of WT1,CTNNB1,WTX,loss of IGF2 imprinting were reported to be involved in Wilms Tumorigenesis en 32 % of these Tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is  a drug with dual mechanism of action : is a cytotoxic chemotherapy drug classified as an antimetabolite and also  a <strong>demethylation agent. </strong>This drug is autorized to treat Myelodisplastic syndromes, Acute Myelod Leukemia and other tumors. In some hematopoietic neoplasm including MDS, DNA hypermethylation can inactivate genes essential for the control of normal cell growth, differentiation and appoptosis, dacitabine inhibit methyltransferases that catalyze the methylation of cytosine residues in newly synthesized DNA, replicating the methylation signal, this blockage resulting in hypomethylation of the DNA and re- expression of tumor supressor genes. Multiple genes appear to be hypermethylated in MDS including p15 (ink4B),which encodes a cell-cycle inhibitor, the methylation of this gene correlates with Blastic production in the bone marrow of leukemic cells, Decitabine treatment reverse hypermethylation of p15 (INK4B) protein expression. in addition  hypomethylation of this  p15 gene has been associated with good hematologic response.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As all the drugs, the hypomethylating agents have side effects, because we do not have enough long term experience with these agents, we really do not know the consequences modifying the " natural " epigenetic response, and  cronically expose the cells to the inhibition of DNA methylation that means modification in chromatin structure, leading enduring alteration of a possible important epigenetic pathway, we really do not know the biological impact, but otherwise, for sure, we assume the great benefit and the health potential that these agents has in cáncer. The effect in DNA hypomethylation persist  after the drug is discontinued, in some cases like in leukemia, the disease come back again, but it is a fact that this hypomethylating agent improves the response to standar chemotherapy and reduces the needs for transfusions, and most important improve the quality of life and life expectancy, at least in myelodisplastic syndromes . There are iatrogenic side effects in some epigenetic modificators like Lupus Like disease, tardive diskinesia. But  the benefit with these medications is greater  than the possible side effects. It is important to identify the sensitive period. Dr. Stephen Baylin at John´s Hopkins combine histone-deacetylase inhibitor plus azacitidine for pulmonar cancer with good results.This treatment makes the cell more susceptible to standar chemotherapy.</p></div>
