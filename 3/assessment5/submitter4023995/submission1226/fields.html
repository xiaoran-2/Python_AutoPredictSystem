    <div class="field-value"><p>In mammals DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively at CpG islands, regions where more CpGs are found than predicted by chance. They tend to be found at gene promoters and are generally unmethylated, but if methylation is found, it is usually associated with gene silencing through condensation of chromatin.</p>
<p>In cancer cells the CpG islands are more likely to be progressively methylated. The CpG islands are located in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, which are epigenetically silenced. This aberrant methylation progresses over time as normal tissue moves through hyperplasia, neoplasia and eventually metastatic invasion. However this picture is complicated by similar patterns of DNA methylation alterations found with aging. Distinct patterns of high levels of CpG island methylation have been described for clinically distinct tumours (CpG island methylated phenotypes CIMPs) for example colorectal cancer, gliomas and neuroblastoma. Recent research has also identified hypermethylation at CpG island shores.</p>
<p>In cancer cells the rest of the genome including the repetitive elements, intergenic regions and even the introns of genes are hypomethylated, a reversal of the normal condition where the genome in general is methylated.</p>
<p>DNA methylation of the repeats maintains genomic stability by preventing chromosome gain or loss and illegitimate re-combinations. This genome-wide hypomethylation is found to some extent in every tumour, and it progresses with time resulting in genomic instability e.g. illegitimate re-combinations and reciprocal translocations. The repeats can also be activated – they copy themselves and transpose disrupting coding regions of a gene or activating neighbouring genes</p>
<p>This aberrant methlyation is mitotically heritable for many cell divisions,silences effectively and can be quickly selected for. The silencing of  tumour suppression genes can act as one of the multiple hits required for cancer to occur (Knudson’s hypothesis). However the methylation is reversible, providing treatment possibilities.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells display hypermethlyation of imprint control regions and loss of imprinting – genes that should display monoallelic parent-of-origin- specific expression become expressed or silenced from both parental alleles.</p>
<p> In the H19/Igf2 cluster the imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal. Where it is methylated enhancers act on IGF2 which is expressed from the paternal allele.  On the maternal allele the imprint control region is unmethylated and CTCF binds to Igf2 as an insulator with no expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>With loss of imprinting there is hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele and Igf2 is now expressed from both maternal and paternal alleles, a double dose compared with the normal cell.  Igf2 is growth promoting and this expression is associated with Wilm’s tumour.</p>
<p>The Igf2 gene codes for a hormone that stimulates growth during embryonic and fetal development. Disruption of imprinting can activate the normally silenced maternal Igf2 gene and if this occurs during egg formation or very early in development it causes Beckwith-Wiedermann Syndrome (BWS). Due to imprinting errors, the rate of BWS is very high in babies conceived using ART </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor – one of the first set of FDA approved drugs that target the epigenetic machinery to treat Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). It is a small molecule inhibitor – targeting the enzymatic epigenetic regulators.</p>
<p>It becomes irreversibly incorporated into the DNA on replication – its action is dependent on cell division.  As cancer cells are dividing and replicating much more rapidly than most other cells in the body, they are more seriously affected by the drug.  At low doses decitabine causes transient DNA demethylation and by this process normal function is restored to the tumour suppressor genes, inproving regulation of cell growth. Longer term treatment with decitabine creates  "a window of epigenetic sensitisation for combination therapies" (Lyko &amp; Brown 2005)</p>
<p>Decitabine is also an antimetabolite producing a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation in somatic cells can be transmitted to daughter cells over the entire lifespan of the individual – they are mitotically heritable, while marks established in germ cells could be transmitted to subsequent generations (see Agouti mice)</p>
<p>During early development there are a number of periods of active remodelling of the epigenome – these are known as sensitive periods, times where there is active reprogramming and laying down of epigenetic marks at different parts in the genome and in the genome as a whole. These sensitive periods last from primordial germ cell development all the way through to production of mature eggs and sperm and include early embryonic development and childhood and puberty especially in the germline of females as oocyctes remain in a haploid de-methylated state until puberty.</p>
<p>Epigenetic drugs potentially affect every cell in the body, so caution needs to applied when using them with young people. A drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery also constitutes a major environmental insult and potentially serious side effects to the foetus would be expected should they be given to pregnant women. </p></div>
