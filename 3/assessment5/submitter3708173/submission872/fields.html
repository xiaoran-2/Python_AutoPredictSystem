    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>the normal function of DNA methylation on the CpG islands is to confirm the old or new strend of the double helix. When the methylation is excessed, it becomes more potential to develop a cancer.</p>
<p>Since the tumor (cancer) supressor usually located on the CpG islands, when it is methylated, it is incativated, which means that it provides a chance to develop diseases.</p>
<p>The normal function of the DNA methylation in intergenic regions is to silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites, and that of the repeatitive elements is to Maintain genomic integrity,also silencing of repeats to prevent transposition.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repeatitive elements cause genomic instability,provide a chance to develop cancer. Also, not only cancer, some diseases should occur.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Paternal allele is methylated thus can act on Igf2, because CTCF is not binding to inactive this; on the other hand, the materhal allele is unmethylated so the Igf2 is then silenced for the maternal allele.</p>
<p>the <em>H19/Igf2 </em>locus is established post-zygotically and may cause body asymmetry and heterogeneity of the clinical phenotype. Finally, the IC1 microdeletions are associated with a high incidence of Wilms' tumour, making their molecular diagnosis particularly important for genetic counselling and tumour surveillance at follow-up.</p>
<p>Other than Wilm's tumor, there are some diseases that can be induced by the same mechanism, that is why disturping imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to diseases.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>     Decitabine is a kind of histone-deacetylase inhibitor. That is, it can progress the acetylase of histone and therefore decrease the methylation of DNA. Since the methylation of DNA is lowered, the methylation on the CpG islands are also reduced. As CpG islands are usually the cancer supressor, the methylation on them may increase the probibality of the development of cancer (tumor). As these supressor is not methylated, it means that they are active, and thus have the anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Results confirm and extend sex differences in maternal care with modest LGC effects. That both LGC and sex have enduring effects on DNA methylation of the <em>Oprm1</em> gene in brain regions associated with addiction, stress regulation, motivation, and cognition may suggest one factor that contributes to gender differences in these behaviors.</p>
<p>Seisitive period is a period of time that is important for children development. As sensitive period in development refers to the most important period of time of the development which the embryo is not sure to have expected functions. So perhaps the awarenessand the wariness that should remember about is that drugs are going to be used throughout the system until every cell could has a potential to be effected by these drugs. So maybe still need to keep in mind that younger patients, particularly those that have developing germ cells in sensitive periods is not recommand for drug using.</p>
