    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, the Cs in CpG islands are unmethylated. This unmethylated state is associated with a more open chromatin structure, which allows for genes to be accessible to the DNA transcription machinery, and thus, functional.  In cancer, however, there is locus-specific hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes.  Hypermethylation at the promoters of these genes has the effect of silencing gene expression by creation of a more compact chromatin structure.  Silencing of tumor suppressor genes in this manner can be a cause of cancer, since one of the breaks on tumor-formation is removed.</p>
<p>DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is normally methylated, but is found to be aberrantly hypomethylated in cancer.  Methylation of repeats and intergenic regions functions to maintain genomic stability, and when these areas are hypomethylated, a number of disruptions can occur.  For example, when repetitive elements are hypomethylated, they lose their silencing, and this can cause illegitimate recombination through misalignment during cellular replication.  These misalignments can cause insertions, deletions and translocations, where one part of a chromosome switches places with another.  This can alter the way the genes are expressed.  Second, transposons, which are repetitive elements that can copy themselves and jump around in the genome, can be activated in hypomethylated DNA, potentially disrupting the genes in the areas where the copied gene moves to.   Third, cryptic promoters in repetitive elements and intergenic regions can be activated in hypomethylated DNA, disrupting the normal function of neighboring genes.  The genomic instability produced by hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can lead to cancer if this disruption leads to overexpression of cancer-promoting oncogenes or underexpression of genes for DNA repair.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal case, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) on the H19/IGF2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.  In the case of the paternal allele, downstream enhancers bind to the IGF2 gene, causing expression of IGF2, and methylation of the ICR silences the H19 gene, repressing its expression.  In the case of the maternal allele, a protein, CTCF, binds to the unmethylated ICR, which has the effect of blocking the downstream enhancers from binding to IGF2, thereby suppressing IGF2 expression.  The enhancers therefore bind to the H19 gene, causing expression of H19.  H19 is growth-suppressing, whereas IGF2 is growth-promoting, so in the normal case there is a balance between the two factors, each expressed from a different parental allele.  In the case of Wilm’s Tumor, however, when the maternal allele loses its imprinting (through methylation of the maternal ICR), it functions just like the paternal allele.  As a result, there is a double dose of IGF2 expressed and a lack of H19 expression, leading to a state that favors growth to the extent that tumor-formation occurs.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a demethyltransferase inhibitor, a drug that hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.  It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia.  Decitabine interferes with DNA methylation through the use of nucleoside analogues that bind to DNA. After cellular replication, when DNMT1 comes in to make the methyl marks on the daughter DNA strands, it becomes bound to the analogues and cannot be released.  This limits the availability of DNMT1, and therefore inhibits DNA methylation from taking place.  Since cancer cells divide more frequently than other somatic cells, they are the most severely affected by the DNMT inhibition.  This inhibitory process is believed to have the most effect on hematological malignancies because these malignancies appear to be dependent on tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation. Treatment with Decitabine in these cases would presumably lead to more tumor suppressor gene expression and therefore fewer cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.  Since cancer drugs that target the epigenome affect all cells, not just cancer cells, it is advisable to avoid treating patients during certain sensitive periods when epigenetic marks are being laid down, because the drug treatment could alter them and disrupt normal functioning of the genes where those marks occur.</p>
<p>The two main sensitive periods for epigenetic modification are during primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development.  Treatment of a pregnant woman with an epigenetic modifier could cause problems for the developing fetus.  It could potentially interfere with the differentiation of cells into the right cell types as the fetus develops and it could interfere with the developing germ cells of the embryo, potentially affecting the developing child’s offspring.  An additional sensitive period for the development of the gametes occurs in children during puberty when the egg and sperm cells go through a period of final development.  It would also be inadvisable to treat these patients with epigenetic modifiers, since their egg or sperm cells could be affected, leading to infertility or genetic defects in their offspring. </p></div>
