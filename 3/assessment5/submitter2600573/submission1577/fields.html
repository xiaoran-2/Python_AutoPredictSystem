    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group on to the 5` carbon.  This occurs almost exclusively on cytosine followed by a guanine (known as CpG) because this makes a pretty symmetric dinucleotide.  CpG islands (long groups of CpG dinucleotides) are generally found at the gene promoters, and when CpG islands are methylated, they silence the gene found downstream. </p>
<p>In cancerous tissue there is not enough methylation at repetitive elements and sometimes too much methylation at the CpG islands. Both of these factors can allow for unchecked growth and tumors, because genes can be overexpressed instead of silenced, or because a mutation that is normally silenced and benign can be expressed and harmful.  Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated and silenced in healthy tissue, when they are unmethylated and active instead of silenced, they often lead to cancer and other problems.</p>
<p>In healthy tissue DNA methylation is in intergenic regions and repetitive elements probably to allow for genomic integrity, i.e. silencing mutations or odd start or splice sites.    Silenced repeats can help prevent transposition, avoid transcriptional interference from other promoters and can help avoid improper chromosomal recombination.  When certain elements are methylated when they should be unmethylated and expressed, or when things that should be active are methylated and silenced, it often causes serious health problems.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele is actively demethylated almost immediately after fertilization, during the first sensitive period of development, while the maternal allele is passively and slowly demethylated.  They are both remethylated after formation of the blastocyst, and are demethylated at an equal rate during primordial germ cell development, although it takes the maternal allele longer than the paternal allele to remethylate at this stage, because eggs take longer to mature. </p>
<p>This affects Igf2 expression due to the insulators between the promoter and the enhancer, which can be methylated (silenced) or unmethylated (active).  Usually the maternal gene is silenced because of methylation on the insulator and the paternal gene is expressed because it does not have a silenced insulator.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, the IGF2 gene is overexpressed, often because of problems with epigenetic imprinting.  The maternal allele is imprinted and the insulator is methylated which overexpresses IGF2, causing the tumor.  In most normal cases IGF2 and H19 genes are imprinted, and loss of imprinting leads to complications and tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  It inhibits DNA methyltransferase, so the gene is not methylated and is therefore not silenced, but active.  It can have an anti-tumor effect if the gene that is demethylated is a tumor-suppressor gene.  When the tumor-suppressor gene is methylated, it is silenced and the tumor can grow unchecked.  With Decitabine, however, the gene is demethylated and active, so the tumor-suppressor genes can function properly and stop the tumor from growing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that effect epigenetics can have long-lasting effects because epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, meaning they are passed on from one cell to its daughter cells, unless something specifically erases them. </p>
<p>The sensitive periods for epigenetic reprogramming are when the epigenetic marks are cleared and then put back.  There are two sensitive periods in development: during primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation period of early embryonic development. </p>
<p>During the sensitive periods the epigenetic marks are cleared so that the cell can recover totipotency.  If you gave patients epigenetic drugs during the sensitive periods, the epigenetic marks would not be cleared, and the cell would not become totipotent.  This means the cells would not be able to differentiate into all the different types of cells needed to make a complete organism, which would lead to many adverse effects.  </p></div>
