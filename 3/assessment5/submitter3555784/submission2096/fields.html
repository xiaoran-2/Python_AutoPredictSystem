    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">CpG methylation is itself mutagenic because it is more likely that the 5met-cytosine to be transformed in thymine. In normal cells, CpG islands, acts as DNA expresion regulators, being susceptible sites for DNA methylation. Since CpG islands are located near the promoter regions, the modification inhibits the transcription of the gene (silencing) by means of disrupting transcription machinery assemblage. In contrast, cancer cells display abnormal CpG hipermethylation that can be elicited by mutations in, for example, Tet proteins, which function is to promote DNA demathylation via hydroxylation. The disruption of normal CpG methylation can lead to cancer development when gene silencing occurs in tumor suppresor genes, causing the cell to be unable to regulate cell growth. Epimutations can also accumulate during tumor progression in a kind of multistep process that may occur in genetic mutations. Additionally, DNA methylation constitutes a more stable transcription silencing that may replace the more labile histone gene silencing H3K27, that is the scenario for de development of some cancers.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">On the other hand, DNA methylation in other DNA regions like intergenic regions and DNA repetitive elements inhibits transcriptional interference over gene expression and prevents the unregulated expression of nearby genes by silencing cryptic promoters. It also maintains genomic integrity by means of preventing chromosomic mutation events due to illegitimate recombination avoidance. Furthermore, methylation of repetitive elements like IAP’s prevent its expression and mobilization thus inhibiting the transposable activity that could lead to an insertion/inactivation in a tumor suppressor gene. These mechanisms may appear when the proteins that remove methylation marks (Tet proteins) and laid down DNA methylatiion are mutated. Genomic instability in general may lead to cancer development and other diseases by the disruption of normal gene expression or the direct mutation over some genes (tumor suppressor or protooncogenes in cancer).</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some imprinted control regions, regulates the expression of protooncogenes so the disruption of normal epigenetic states in those imprinted sites could lead to cancer development. An example of this situation is the H19/Igf2 ICR. The ICR is composed of a methylating site between Igf2 (a growth promoter) and H19 (a lncRNA) that is paternally imprinted (methylated). The methylation of this ICR inhibits the CTCF insulator binding and allows enhancers located downstream H19 to promote Igf2 rather than H19 ncRNA expression. In the absence of CTCF methylation also spreads to the H19 promoter causing a double repression of this gene. On the other hand, in normal cells, the maternal copy isn't imprinted and CTCF is able to bind the methylated site thus inhibiting Igf2 and promoting H19 expression. When the maternally inherited copy (inherited from the mother) resembles the paternal imprinting status there is an excess of Igf2 gene product that may contribute to Wlim’s cancer a disease associated with Beckwith Widemann’s syndrome that also leads to other overgrowth caused manifestations like macroglossia. This is caused because the growth promoting activity of Igf2 is augmented and it can also be evidenciated in prenatal and postnatal overgrowth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA demethylation promoting drugs like</span> Decitabine are nucleoside like molecules that are able to get inserted in the DNA during replication. When DNMT1 recognizes it, the enzyme becomes irreversibly inactivated. Inasmuch as Decitabine doesn’t display incorporation specificity in the DNA, it can lead to generalized reduction of DNA methylation, including the hypermethylated CpG island that are found in cancer epigenome. Thus, it could reduce the methylation over tumour suppressor genes and have an antitumoral effect. In spite Decitabine affects all cells, it may have a therapeutic action because  it relies on the DNA replication and cell proliferation, so cancer cells, with such an accelerated growth and division rate would be more susceptible to the drug. Furthermore, it could be used in treatments, in the background of making cancer cells more susceptible to chemotherapeutics and improving in a synergic manner the effect of other epigenetic drugs like HDAC’s inhibitors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Once epigenetic therapy is started, i.e. with demethylation promoting agents, it could elicit the stablishment of epigenetic marks (demethylated sites) that would remain unmethylated and would be mitotically heritable. This make sense considering that DNMT1 only recognizes hemimethylated DNA, so the enzime would only maintain the methylated DNA in replication regardless of the further presence of the drug. If those DNA promoted modifications are deleterious for cancer cell, future treatments with chemotherapeutics would be more effective since there would be a previous regression in the tumor progression (less cancer promoting marks). <br />Such treatments that alters the epigenetic machinery may be quite dangerous to utilize in sensitive periods; those periods when is given an active whole genome epigenetic remodeling, like the preimplantation, primordial germ cell development and germ cell development stages. Unlike the adult stage when all the tissues are differentiated and the epigenetic marks are maintained throughout cell lineages, in sensitive periods there is an active de novo laid down of those marks The application in these periods must be minimized because it could elicit a fail in the reestablishment epigenetic marks considering that the inhibition of epigenetic machinery would disrupt this process and induce genome generalized epigenetic aberrations.</p></div>
