    <div class="field-value"><p> CpG islands are generally unmethylated.  When located at a gene promoter region, a methylated CpG island is correlated with the silencing of the corresponding gene.  In cancer cells, the methylome is disrupted in two ways. </p>
<p>On the one hand, there is a loss of methylation at the global scale of the genome.  Such loss of methylation carries with it genomic instability and deregulation of both tissue specific and of imprinted genes.  Intergenic methylation is believed to act to maintain genomic integrity. The loss of methylation in intergenic regions means that transposable, repetitive and oncogene elements which are normally silent in normal DNA methylation, can become active, contributing to genomic instability as these elements start spreading to arbitrary places on the genome.  Also, this demethylation can cause effects such as deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions in the genome.  The deregulation of imprinted and tissue specific genes will result in faulty workings of the cell of the nature seen in cases where such malfunction occurs in individuals born with various congenital syndromes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in cancer cells, CpG islands will tend to become hypermethylated.  Such regional methylation can be associated with the silencing of tumor suppresor genes which control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair.  The loss of such controlling mechanisms in a cancer cells can lead them to exhibit aberrant behavior such as unregulated growth and spreading.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is paternally imprinted as the imprinted control region is methylated on the paternal allele.  This methylation spreads downstream onto the H19 region silencing its expression. As the the H19 is not expressed, the downstream promoters will bind to the Igf2 region and express it from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the unmethylated imprint control region allows for the insulating CTCF protein to bind.  CTCF will then insulate the Igf2 region from the downsteam promoters which will instead act on the H19 region.  As the H19 region is unmethylated, it expresses the H19 lncRNA.  So, Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>Igf2 promotes growth.  When there is a loss of imprinting through mutation/deletion, uniparental disomy or epigenetic disruption one can end up with a situation which effectively acts as having two paternal alleles. This means that having lost the functionality of the maternal allele,  the cell gets too much Igf2 (growth promoter) and there is no Cdkn1c(growth inhibitor) being produced.  In Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, such loss of imprinting and thus disregulation of Cdkn1c/Igf2 will predispose the individual to overgrowth and Wilm's tumors as the growth promoters/growth suppresors are out of balance.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of the epigenetic drugs which acts as a DNA de-methylyzer.  By reducing hypermethylation at cancer CpG islands, it might undo some of the changes induced by cancer whereby some tumor suppresor genes have been silenced and thus bring the tumor under control.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylome's stability is maintained across cell divisions.  Thus, drug induced alterations to the DNA methylome can continue to be in effect after treatment has stopped.  Periods when the epigenetic marks are cleared and then set anew are considered particularly sensitive periods. Such periods are especially the time of early embryonic development and also the time of germ cell epigenetic reprogramming.  Altering the patterns of epigenetic marks through a blunt device such as epigenetic drugs would have very broad and wide ranging effects on the developing individual and so would not be advisable at such times as they might cause more harm than good.</p></div>
