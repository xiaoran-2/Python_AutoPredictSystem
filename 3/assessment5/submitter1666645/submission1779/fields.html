    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands could include, silencing of gene expression, by formation of repressive chromatin structure and alter gene expression</li>
</ul><ul><li>DNA methylation at CpG islands, in cancer, is disrupted by Hypermethylation at CpG islands, CpG island shores and imprinting control regions; and  Hypomethylation of repetitive elements, intergenic regions and CpG poor promoters.</li>
</ul><ul><li>The effect of disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands depends on the region affected. In CIMP tumours  the CpG island hypermethylation occurs in sets of genes and in a tumour-specific pattern. and If the CpG islands is located in tumour suppressor genes, let to the expression decrease, which stimulates tumour growth.</li>
</ul><ul><li>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repeats occurs almost exclusively at CpG dinucleotides in mammals. In general, this methylation means maintaining genomic integrity and stability. In repetitive elements, the methylation avoid transcription of strong promoters, Prevent illegitimate recombination, Prevents transposition, Increase the rate of methylated 1cytosine to thymine, which also prevents transposition. </li>
<li>In intergenic regions, methylation maintains genomic stability and also avoids activation of cryptic transcription and splicing sites.CpG islands are usually unmethylated</li>
</ul><ul><li>In cancer, the disruption of methylation consists on reducing methylation at these regions, and hypermethylation in CpG islands. The hypomethylation leads to an increment of genomic instability, because all the repressive mechanisms are now activated, and the CpG islands hypermethylation silencing gene expression.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a somatic cell, the H19/Igf2 is control by an insulator protein, CTCF which avoid the binding of enhancers to Igf2 promoter.</p>
<ul><li>In the paternal allele, the imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated and this blocks the union of CTFC. The enhancers interact with Igf2 promoter and start expressing it because a physical change in the DNA. The methylation at ICR spreads to the H19 locus and blocks its expression. In the paternal allele, methylation blocks expression of H19 and allow expression of Igf2</li>
</ul><ul><li>In the maternal the ICR is not methylated, so CTFC binds it. This binding isolates Igf2, so it is not accessible for the enhancers. The enhancers promote the expression of H19. In the maternal allele, methylation silences Igf2 and H19 is expressed.</li>
</ul><ul><li>In the case of Wilm’s tumour, the cluster is altered: maternal allele shows the same pattern of methylation as the paternal allele. The dosage of Igf2 is increased, because both alleles express Igf2 (there is no isolating due to CTCF binding).</li>
</ul><ul><li>This increase in Igf2 dosage is responsible for the growing of tumours because it is a mitotic activator, and regulates cellular growth and development.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. It is a nucleoside like-inhibitor (cytosine-like), it is incorporated to DNA after chemical conversion. When DNMTs try to methylate this cytosine-like compound, the complex decitabine DNMT it is blocked and degraded by proteasome. Decitabine works avoiding the DNMT action.<br />The anti-tumour effect mediated by decitabine is because when blocking DNA methylation, promoters of genes are activated. This activation includes promoters from tumour-supressor genes and other genes related to cellular growth control, so this leads to the decrease of tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The drugs used in the treatment of tumours could have and enduring effect on the epigenome. These effects would be visible if the treatment affects any of the sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming.</li>
</ul><ul><li>A sensitive period is a period in development in which the epigenetic marks are reprogrammed.</li>
<li>During the pre-implantation period, the parental genome suffers a rapid and active demethylation, while maternal genome is passively demethylated. Other sensitive period is the primordial germ cell development (mid-gestation). In this period, epigenetic marks are re-establish in somatic cells in a lineage-specific way, and cells that will be primordial germ cells need to be reprogrammed.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Due to the relevant events that are establish during these two sensitive periods- any deffect would lead to serious health problems in the future life, (sterility, development disorders, cancer…) it is not advisable using these drugs in sensitive periods (pregnant women and/or childhood)</li>
