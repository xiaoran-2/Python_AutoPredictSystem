    <h1>Submission 1550 from Anon (session_user_id: 55b2c1a344803090d5d8bf91f8c67f8ab932c322)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that belongs to the group of <span> DNA-demethylating agents. This drug inhibits DNA methytransferases in an irreversible manner forming a covalent complex in the serine residue of the active site of these enzymes. As result of this inhibition, the DNA become hypomethylated. Decitabine has an anti-tumor effect in <span>myelodysplastic syndromes because it decreases the aberrant hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands, which allow the expression of the tumor supressor genes that are inadecuatelly silenced in this type of cancerous cells.</span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA  methylation at CpG islands is to control the gene expression. If the CpG islands present in the promoter region of a gene are methylated, the gene is silenced.</p>
<p>DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted so that  these islads become hypermethylated. As result, the CpG islands in the promoter regions of many tumor supressor genes become methylated. This produces the silencing of these genes, which contributes to the developement of cancerous cells.  </p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements help to maintain the genomic integrity because it silences repeats to prevent transposition and illegitimate recombination. The disruption of the DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements permits the expression of transposons and repetitive sequences (remnants of retroviral insertions, satellites, etc) that produces genomic instability (transposition, mutations and recombinations), which lead to the generation of cancerous cells (the genomic instability promotes the overexpression of oncogenes and the inactivation of tumor supressor genes). </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR on the maternal allele remains unmethylated allowing CTCF and its cofactors to bind. This interaction <span>blocks the downstream enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promoter and they instead</span> access the H19 promoter. Therefore, H19 is expressed.</p>
<p>The ICR on the paternal allele is methylated so that CTCF and its cofactors cannot bind. The H19 promoter is methylated and cannot be expressed. As result, the enhancers acces the Igf2 promoter. Therefore, Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p><span>Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted <span>in Wilm’s tumours </span>so that <span>H19 become inactive and <span>Igf2 is <span>biallelically active. Igf2 is an oncogene (involved in cell proliferation) so when it is active and is not controlled by the H19 (which is inactive) promotes de development of cancerous cells as in Wilm’s tumours. </span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation pattern is mitotically hereditary, so the modifications of the DNA methylation produce epigenetic effects that are inherited by the descendent cells. As result, the epigenetic modificatons caused by one drug can persist during many cell generations.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals because epigenetic reprograming occur during that time. The sensitive periods during development are: early development and primordial germ cell development. The treatment with drugs during sensitive periods is inadvisable because these drugs can easily produce epigenetical modifications that can be transmited to the next generations. As result, the offspring can be more susceptible to develop diseases related with epigenetic modifications.</p></div>
