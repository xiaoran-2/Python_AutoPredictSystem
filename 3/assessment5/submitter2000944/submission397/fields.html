    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><span>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands includes at least 1) govern X-chromosome inactivation; 2) essential for the maintenance of imprinted genes; 3) determining the cell-type-specific expression patterns of genes; 4) <span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>formation of heterochromatin (silencing of gene expression).</span></span></li>
<li><span>In cancer cells, CpG islands, which are usually unmethylated, tend to become hypermethylated. </span></li>
<li><span>Hypermethylated CpG may </span><span>cause genomic instability,deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes, which are contributable to disease. </span></li>
<li><span><span class="Apple-converted-space">The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity, including silencing/mutation of repeats to prevent transposition, and to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and may also prevent illegitimate recombination.</span></span></li>
<li><span>In cancer cells,</span> intergenic regions and repetitive elements , which are usually methylated, tend to become hypomethylated.</li>
<li>Hypomethylated DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements may lead to genomic instability and oncogene activation.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><span>In H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal copy of H19 is methylated and silent, which results in the expression of Igf2.</span></li>
<li><span>In H19/Igf2 cluster, the maternal copy of H19 is hypomethylated or unmethylated, which results in the slience of Igf2.</span></li>
<li>In Wilm’s tumour, Igf2 is overexpressed due to hypermethylation of <span>imprinting control regions</span> (ICR).</li>
<li>Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster results in the loss of its maternal imprinting, which may lead to genomic instability and oncogene activation.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><span><span class="Apple-converted-space">Decitabine belongs to </span>DNA-demethylating agents</span></li>
<li>It can hypomethylate DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</li>
<li>It can demethylate or interfer with the methylation of tumor suppressor genes, thus normal function of the tumor suppressor genes may be restored. Meanwhile, it also have chemotherapy effect (antimetabolites) that causes death of dividing cancer cells.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><span>DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark</span> which can be <span>passed on to offspring cells.</span></li>
<li><span>Senstive period means period when <span>reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs</span>. Reprogramming is erasuring and remodeling of epigenetic marks</span></li>
<li>Sensitive periods include periods during gametogenesis (germ cell development) and after fertilization (early embryonic  development ) where DNA methylation r<span>eprogramming happens.</span></li>
<li>Treating patients during sensitive periods will affect <span>reprogramming of DNA methylation </span>which is very important for development.</li>
