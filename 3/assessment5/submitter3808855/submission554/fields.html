    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in several ways in cancer.  One is that CpG islands in the promoter region, which is usually unmethylated, becomes hypermethylated in cancer cells.  This methylation causes the silencing of the tumor suppressor genes, which leads to abnormal growth in somatic cells.  In normal cells, Intergenic regions, introns, and repetitive elements are methylated.  Repetitive elements are also further compacted by chromatin remodelers, so that they are tighly packed and silenced.  In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements become unmethylated, which leaves the DNA in these regions open to abnormal transcription, mutation, or transposition.  Another way is that the oncogene, which is normally methylated, becomes hypomethylated.  This activates the oncogene and leads to abnormal cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CTCF binds to the inprint control region (ICR) of the maternal allele.  This causes the enhancers to act on H19, which has the effect of restricting growth.  The ICR and H19 gene of the paternal allele are methylated.  This causes the enhancers to act on and express Igf2, which has the effect of increasing growth.  Because Igf2 is slient in the maternal allele, only the paternal copy of Igf2 is expressed.  The combination of the active H19 gene on the maternal allele and the active Igf2 gene on the paternal allele maintains normal cell growth.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, ICR and H19 are methylated and Igf2 is expressed on the maternal allele.  Since Igf2 is also expressed on the paternal allele, this leads to a double dose of Igf2, which causes abnormal cell growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  It removes methylation marks on sections of genes.  Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, by inducing <span>hypomethylation in neoplastic cells.  This limits the growth of tumour cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so that it's maintained through cell division.  Sensitive periods are time intervals where rapid epigenetic reprogramming occurs, such as during early fetal development or formation of sex cells.  Treating patients during these sensitive periods should be avoids, because it could lead to hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions, which may cause geneomic instability.</p></div>
