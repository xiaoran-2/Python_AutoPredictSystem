    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is FDA approved epigenetic drugs, known on the market as Dacogen, made by Eisai, Japan. Drug is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursor of the acute myelogenous leukemia.Decitabine is DNMT inhibitor, nucleoside analogues, incorporated into DNA, therefore replication independent. In addition, Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent which hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Cancers are caused by mutations that make enzyme overactive, so Decitabine is used to inhibit enzyme activity. Drug is targeting the enzymatic epigenetic machinery since enzymes are readily targeted by small inhibitor’s molecule and because epigenetic machinery is reversible so we are able to treat cancer. In the beginning (around 1970s) high doses are used to treat patients but nowadays, lower doses usage has anti-neoplastic effects and better results. Mechanism of action is still unclear and clinical trials are undergoing but patient's life quality is better and life expectancy is extended.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The whole concept behind epigenetic drugs treatment is to do the reprogramin of chemical changes that affect the DNA of cancer cells and develop memory antitumor response. Epigenetic changes are passed on a daughter and granddaughter cells until they are all actively erased. Once erased, they should not return. It might be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. Sensitive period are any period when we would like to avoid treating patients with the epigenetic drugs that affect epigenetic marks. Mechanism of action is still unclear so the drugs could cause side effects over a long time period. Sensitive periods of development could be periods when this therapy have effects on embryonic development, genomic imprinting (allele-specific expression), X-chromosome inactivation, transcription and preservation of chromosome stability. In addition, using this therapy in early stage of disease or in younger patients should be, also, looked carefully.</p>

    <div class="field-value"><p class="norm">DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification and takes place in covalent transfer of the methyl group at the 5' carbon of the cytosine ring by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), giving 5-methylcytosine which successfully inhibits transcription. In human DNA, 5-methylcytosine is found more frequently at sets of genes, small stretches of DNA called CpG islands. These islands are usually found in or near promoter regions of genes, where transcription is initiated. CpG islands in germ-line tissue and promoters of normal somatic cells stay unmethylated, allowing gene expression to happen. Most DNA methylation is essential for normal development, and it plays a very important role in a number of key processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and suppression of repetitive element transcription and transposition and, when contributes to diseases like cancer.</p>
<p class="norm">Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as an important component of cancer development. One of therm, hypermethylation, normally occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation and has concerned influence in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms. In a cancer, gene promoter CpG islands acquire hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing.Gene silencing by hypermethylation is relatively common in human cancer and may have a causal relationship with tumor development and progression.Tumor suppressor genes and those encoding cell adhesion molecules and growth-regulatory proteins are often silenced by DNA hypermethylation.</p>
<p class="norm">The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity while the function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is to protect the genome from transposable elements. Both of these regions are usually methylated. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability (illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The IGF2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called insulin-like growth factor 2. This protein plays an essential role in growth and development before birth. For the IGF2 gene, the copy that is inherited from a person's father is the only active copy in most parts of the body. This sort of parent-specific difference is caused by genomic imprinting. IGF2 is part of a cluster of genes - H19, which is also involved in growth and development. Increased activity of the IGF2 gene has been associated with many types of cancer. Normally, the IGF2 gene undergoes genomic imprinting and only the copy inherited from a person's father is active. In some cancers, however, both the paternal and the maternal copies of the gene are active, increasing the amount of IGF2. This is known as loss of imprinting, common feature of cancer. Without CTCF isulator protein (insulate IGF2) DNA methylation spreds to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access IGF2 to activate. An increased amount of IGF22 may stimulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells from being destroyed. Loss of imprinting of the IGF2 gene has been identified in several types of cancer known as embryonal tumors. These tumors include a rare form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor.</p>
