    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since CpG islands are often found in the promotors of genes, CpG dinucleotide methylation is associated with the gene silencing. A repressive chromatin structure forms around the methylated nucleotides, which keeps transcription factors away from them. If the CGI of a tumor suppressor gene is methylated in this way, the tumor suppressor will not be expressed. This epigenetic abnormality is common in cancer. </p>
<p>Most intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in a healthy genome. This prevents illegitimate DNA recombination, the expression of transposons, and the activation of cryptic promotors that could disrupt normal gene expression. In all tested cancers, these regions lose methylation, leading to increased genomic instability and more frequent mutations. Cellular architecture becomes more irregular as mutations multiply, which may account for the gross structural abnormalities seen in cancer cells.</p>
<p>As cancer progresses, CpG islands typically become increasingly hypermethylated, while the genome as a whole becomes hypomethylated. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Problems with genomic imprinting are often found in cancers, including Wilm's tumor. The H19/Igf2 cluster consists of four major elements: the Igf2 gene, an ICR that can bind CTCF proteins, a lncRNA site (H19), and downstream enhancers. A normal paternal allele will express Igf2 and the downstream enhancers, but have repressive methylation on the H19 site. A normal maternal allele will <em>not</em> express Igf2 because the CTCF proteins and the H19 lncRNA will block the enhancers. </p>
<p>Igf2 is a growth factor. Cancerous growths, including Wilm's tumor, may result when it is upregulated. It becomes upregulated when The CTCF-binding ICR and the H19 lncRNA site are methylated on both the maternal and the paternal allele, leaving the enhancers free to act on both copies of the Igf2 gene. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decibatine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It acts as a nucleoside analog that inserts itself permanently into the genome, where it blocks DNA methylation. It reduces the overall CpG island methylation on the genome, which allows increased expression of tumor suppressor genes. This is how the drug counteracts blood cancers. Since DNMT inhibitors are toxic at high doses and the long-term side effects are still unknown, researchers are exploring treatments that give small doses of decibatine combined with other drugs. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is so important that mouse embryos that can't produce DNA methyltransferase die in utero. Unfortunately, we do not yet have the technology to target specific parts of the genome for epigenetic reprogramming. A DNMT inhibitor demethylates at random, and it could alter the expression of all kinds of other genes as it activates the target tumor suppressors. DNMT inhibitors act as nucleoside analogs, and it is currently impossible to remove a nucleoside analog from the sequence once it has been inserted. Alterations made by these drugs are permanent.</p>
<p>It is inadvisable to expose patients to drugs that disrupt DNA methylation during sensitive periods of development when the genome is experiencing a stripping and resetting of methylation. These sensitive periods include the preimplantation and primary germ cell development stages of the human embryo, so it would be dangerous to give these drugs to a woman who is pregnant or who may become pregnant.  </p></div>
