    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:left;">In cancer, we see an aberrant DNA methylation profile that typically leads to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, among other effects. DNA methylation normally functions as a mitotically heritable, inactive epigenetic mark. It is laid down by DNA methyltransferases (e.g., DNMT1) and can be removed passively or actively. At CpG islands found at promoters, which are usually unmethylated, DNA methylation results in the silencing of gene expression. This can occur either via a primary mechanism that involves the formation of heterochromatin or more rarely, by a secondary mechanism that involves the inhibition of transcription factor binding. In cancer, we typically observe hypermethylation of CpG islands, thereby effectively silencing tumor suppressor genes and allowing cancer cells to proliferate sans regulation.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements functions to maintain genomic stability by silencing cryptic start/splice sites, preventing illegitimate recombinations, and protecting the genome from transposable elements. In cancer, we observe genome-wide hypomethylation. Specifically at repeats and intergenic regions, hypomethylation results in genomic instability. This can occur due to illegitimate recombinations between the repetitive elements, activation and transposition of the repeats, and activation of cryptic transcription start sites or splice sites. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:left;">Although the mechanism of different ICRs varies, ICRs generally function to control parent-of-origin expression at the imprinted cluster. At the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is methylated, which blocks CTCF, an insulator factor, from binding. Without CTCF binding, the H19 promoter is also methylated and silenced, allowing downstream enhancers to access and activate Igf2 upstream. Therefore, methylation of the paternal ICR ultimately leads to the imprinted expression of Igf2. On the maternal strand of this cluster, the ICR is unmethylated, which allows CTCF to bind. H19 is not methylated and is thereby expressed. The downstream enhancers are blocked by CTCF and unable to activate Igf2. We can look at Wilm’s tumor to illustrate the importance of ICRs. Wilm’s tumor is a tumor of the kidney. In this disease, we observe a loss of imprinting due to hypermethylation of the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster. ICR hypermethylation leads to the maternal strand behaving like the paternal strand and the overepression of Igf2. In disease, disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster either via hypomethylation or hypermethylation often results in the silencing of growth restricting genes and the overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:left;">Decitabine is an FDA-approved, DNA methyltransferase inhibitor used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. When incorporated into DNA, Decitabine works by acting as a nucleoside analogue and binds to DNMT irreversibly, thereby effectively preventing DNMT from laying down more methyl groups. Following cell replication, we can observe a decrease in DNA methylation. Therefore, the usage of Decitabine has an anti-neoplastic effect due to  the demethylation of the DNA, thus leading to expression of important tumor suppressor genes and other genes necessary for the control of cell proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p align="left">Changes to DNA methylation, an inactive epigenetic mark, can be passed on during cell division to daughter cells and can only be erased by active mechanisms. By definition, epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable. Thus, epigenetic drugs can have effects on the epigenome that last beyond the period of drug treatment. One should avoid administering these drugs during sensitive periods (i.e., periods of epigenetic reprogramming such as early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development). During these sensitive periods, epigenetic marks are cleared in order to restore total potency between generations. Therefore, administering epigenetic therapies during these sensitive may not have an effect on the patient since the epigenome will be cleared at this time. Furthermore, it may have an unwanted impact on the patient’s germ cells and lead to possible complications/disease in the patient’s offspring.  </p></div>
