    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is silencing of gene expression.   CpG islands normally are hypomethylated. Small subsets of CpG islands are methylated in different cell types. In cancer CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated. This leads to inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. (DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation to silence tumor suppressor genes). Cancer cells may fail to differentiate well.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is maintaining genomic integrity. These regions are usually methylated. In cancer these regions are hypomethylated. This leads to genomic instability of cancer cells (deletions, Insertions, reciprocal translocations). Also transposed repetitive elements may activate oncogenes.</p>
<p>The other hallmark of cancer is ICRs loss of imprinting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CTCF is an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancer.  DNA methylation at ICR on a paternal allele blocks binding of CTCF,  methylation also spreads to H19 promoter and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate.  On maternal allele, with no methylation and presence of CTCF, enhancers act on H19. </p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor ICR on maternal allele is methylated as if it were paternal allele. So global overexpression of Igf2 occurs. Expression of H19 is decreased.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It is a DNA-demethylating agent (DNMT inhibitor). Mechanism of action still anclear. Replication dependent – nucleoside analogues irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA. Toxic, nonspecific. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and rarely removable in time other than sensitive periods.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. These periods are primordial germ cells development and early embryonic development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it could interfere epigenetic reprogramming process and alter epigenetic marks genome-wide in all tissues of organism or descendents organism in case of (PGC) </p></div>
