    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is characterized by DNA methylation abnormalities. The global level of methylation (i.e. intergenic regions and repetitive) decrease during the progression from normal tissue to cancer (genome-wide hypomethylation), but, at the same time, the level of methylation in some CpG islands (CGIs) tends to increase (locus specific hypermethylation).</p>
<p>In normal tissue CGIs methylation in the promoter inhibits the expression of the gene. In general CGIs are hypomethylated in normal tissue, in cancer CGIs results to be hypermethylated, in particular in tumour suppressor genes. CGIs methylation is mitotically inheritable, so this is a good way to keep these genes silenced in cancer.</p>
<p>In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive are hypermethylated and this play an important role in genome stability keeping this DNA densely packaged in heterochromatin and “protected”. In cancer intergenic regions and repetitive are hypomethylated and this less heterochromatized DNA can be easily affected by illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and trasposons and activation of cryptic promoter or disruption of gene coding region. An important evidence of this genomic instability comes from ICF syndrome in which mutations in DNMT3 lead to genomic instability.</p>
<p>However we must consider that the role of DNA methylation is context dependent and it is strongly related to the nature or of the state of tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and CTCF binds the insulator element and the enhancer can act on H19, but because of Igf2 is silent on maternal allele the expression is silenced. In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and the enhancer act on Igf2 because CTCF is not binded and Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumot, with the losing of this imprinting, also the maternal control region result to be methylated and Igf2 is expressed also in the maternal allele. This cause and overexpression of Igf2 (double), and Igf2 is a growth factor that can contribute to stimulate abnormal cell proliferation in Wilm’s tumour</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">Decitabine is nucleoside analogue that acts as DNA-demethylating agent that hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs inhibitor). This molecule act as an “epigenetic drug” reducing DNA methylation and once the methylation is removed it not pass to the next generation of daughter cells. We can hypotised to use Decitabine in epigenetic therapy to remove abnormal methylated region (i.e. on tumor suppressor genes) in order to block the gene silencing in all the next geneation cells. This could be interesting thinking to a possibile adiuvant effect of this molecules in chemotherapy, for example we can rmove the methylation form the promoter of MGMT gene in glioma cells to increse the efficiency of Temozolomide (MGMT is required for the conversion of temozolomide in the active form).</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modification are mitotically inheritable and are passed on during cell division to the next generation of daughter cells. When DNA methylation is removed it will be not present in the next cell division and will remain in the epigenome. It is important to consider, before the administration of epigenetic drug, the potential effect on the epigenome whit particular attention to sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are periods of time in which the environment (meant as external agents) can influence the epigenetic makeup. In particular are consider sensitive the periods of active remodelling of epigenome such as: from the primordial germ cell development to the production of mature eggs and sperms and the pre-implantation to the early post implantation period.</p>
<p>Treating a patient in this period is not recommendable because in sensitive period there is an active epigenomic reprogramming with changes in the epigenetic marks in different part of the epigenome. A treatment with drugs that can interfere with epigenetic con affect in a not controlled/predictable way this process.</p></div>
