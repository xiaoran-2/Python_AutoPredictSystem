    <div class="field-value"><p>The majority of CpG sites in human DNA are methylated, however CpG islands tend to be protected from DNA methylation. Methylation of CpG islands is associated with gene silencing when found at the gene promoter. By keeping CGIs methylation free it is possible that these areas are less susceptible to mutation pressure, and are maintained to enable gene expression when required. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable due to the action of DNA methyltransferases. In cancer the DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted. Hypermethylation occurs at promoter associated CpG islands, causing silencing of the affected gene. This is permanent as the methylation marks are copied during mitosis. Hundreds of thousands of genes can be silenced by hypermethylation of CGIs in human cancer.  However, methylation varies in individual patients and different cancer types. Methylation of tumour suppressor genes, DNA repair genes, transcription factors and many other gene types contribute to cancer. Single gene CGI hypermethylation occurs in cancers such as retinoblastoma, but sets of genes can also be affected in some types of cancer.</p>
<p><br />In contrast to CGIs, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in DNA are normally methylated.  This methylation contributes to the maintenance of genomic stability by preventing or reducing the incidences of deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations in intergenic DNA, with the silencing of repeats to provide additional protection from transcriptional interference from strong promoters, mutations or illegitimate recombinations of genes in DNA. In cancer, hypomethylation can be found at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, causing genomic instability. The hypomethylation contributes towards illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transpositions, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring alleles. Mice with impaired DNMT1 function show widespread genomic hypomethylation, which can cause aggressive T lymphomas to develop, and activated retroviral elements. Evidence of genomic instability caused by hypomethylation has been reported in many human cancers. DNA methylation depletion can suppress or enhance tumourigenesis, depending on the stage affected, and the tumour type.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Igf2 gene is normally expressed on the paternal allele. Methylation at the imprint control region (ICR) prevents the binding of CTCF, allowing the enhancers on the H19 side of the insulator to access Igf2, which is then expressed. The H19 promoter is also methylated, silencing H19.  The H19 gene is expressed on the maternal allele. CTCF binds to four binding sites within the ICR. This generates an insulator that prevents Igf2 accessing the enhancers on the H19 side of the insulator. The ICR remains unmethylated, which allows the downstream enhancers access to the H19 promotor, expressing the H19 gene.</p>
<p><br />Wilm's tumour is the most common childhood kidney tumour. The imprinting of the Igf2/H19 cluster shows disruption in the case of Wilm's tumour. The ICR is methylated on the maternal allele, together with the H19 promoter region. This prevents CTCF binding, which leads to H19 no longer being expressed, and Igf2 being over-expressed as it is expressed from the paternal and maternal alleles.  Igf2 undergoes a loss of imprinting in most Wilm's tumours. The loss of imprinting of Igf2 is associated with an eighty-fold down regulation of H19 gene expression.  The loss of H19 expression causes inactivation of H19 as a tumour suppressor gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an drug authorised for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. It is a DNA methytransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).  Decitabine irreversibly binds DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA and is replication dependent. Decitabine is comprised of nucleoside analogs. DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 binds to a nucelotide to copy the methylation from the parent strand to the daughter strand. Decitabine causes DNA methyltransferase to be bound irreversibly and can no longer be released. Dose is important as high doses are toxic, but not acting in the range that causes DNA demethylation, so are also ineffective.  Decitabine induces DNA demethylation, which enables the re-expression of epigentically silenced genes. These genes may be a combination of tumour suppressor genes, and growth control genes, that once re-expressed create normal cells, rather than cancer cells and reduce the balance of cancer cells to healthy cells. It can also increase sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, which can be used as a combined therapy to promote an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is passed on to daughter and granddaughter cells during cell division. Epigenetic changes caused by imprinting, development, or as a response to the environment, drug therapy or normal ageing processes are therefore passed on, altering the epigenome as the altered cells proliferate. In the case of epigenetic drug therapy the altered epigenetic marks are passed on during cell division, and in the case of DNA demethylation, epigenetic changes are passed on until the marks are erased, at which point they do not return, and the epigenome is permanently altered.  Epigenetic marks are cleared between generations to enable totipotency. The paternal and maternal genome are demethylated, and repetitative elements and imprinted genes undergo variant epigenetic reprogramming. The periods in which this epigenetic clearing occurs are termed sensitive periods. These sensitive periods of development occur during early embryonic development, and during primordial germ cell development.  Epigenetic drugs have the potential to affect every cell in the body, not just cancer cells. Young patients may still have developing primordial germ cells. Prescribing a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery may have wide reaching, poorly understood effects, if prescribed during sensitive periods, and should be avoided unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential harm. Treating pregnant women is also inadvisable as it could have serious consequences for the developing fetus. </p></div>
