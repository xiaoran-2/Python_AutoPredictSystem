    <h1>Submission 690 from Anon (session_user_id: ea633c2a7b6f04bc269d28b96592fe90f8059b10)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methylating inhibitor.  <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">It prevents DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) from operating during DNA replication by binding to it irreversibly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">When DNA replicates, methylated CG nucleotides gain unmethylated  pairs on the other strand.  DNMT is attracted to the hemi-methylated DNA and adds methylation </span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">de novo</em><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> to the unmethylated strand.  With this action being inhibited, further DNA replication increases the abundance of unmethylated nucleotides and overall methylation is passively degenerated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Since many tumor suppressor genes are silenced by DNA methylation, the effect of decatabine is to reactivate the expression of these genes to control cell growth and induce apostosis.  For decitabine to be active, it must be incorporated into the DNA of the cell, which can cause mutations in daughter cells if the cell does not have programmed death. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an essential feature of stages of embryonic development, and in mature somatic cells, including interaction with the environment. It is also vital in the process of imprinting parental genes.  Cancer - abnormal cell growth - is characterised by disruption and imbalance of methylation within the genome.   DNA methylation of chromatin is disrupted by both hypermethylation on certain loci and a genome wide hypomethylation of intergenic regions.  Whether either more or less methylation activates tumour growth is dependent on the type and even the stage of development of the cancer type.</p>
<p>Methylation occurs overwhelmingly at CpG dinucleotides, with the notable exception of large CG clusters (called CpG islands) often found in or near promoters for gene expression that are usually unmethylated and are protected from methylation under normal circumstances.   In cancerous cells, the CpG islands and nearby CG groups (called island shores) become methylated, causing the associated promoters to be inactive and thus vital proteins expressed by the associated genes will be under-produced.  Tumour suppressor genes may not be functional due to their silenced promoters, and on imprinted genes there is loss of imprinting, which causes a number of serious conditions and may at times be fatal.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions, CpG methylation  normally occurs in the regions containing introns, repeats, mobile elements, transposons, etc.  Methylation greatly reduces activity  in these regions, silencing cryptic transcriptions, preventing illegitimate recombinations, reciprocal translocations, transcriptional interference and generally promotes widespread genomic stability. </p>
<p>When these methylation marks are removed, the intergenic elements can become active, allowing new insertions or deletions, activiation of cryptic promoters and recombinations,  causing instability and disruption to genes elsewhere possibly resulting in mutations, activation of oncogenes, and silencing of tumour suppressor genes, allowing some uncontrolled growth.  Again, these actions will also lead to loss of imprinting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In imprinting, an allele is only expressed if inherited from a ‘preferred’ parent, the other allele of the particular gene from the other parent is silenced (i.e. imprinted). </span></p>
<p><span>For example, in the IGF2/H19 gene cluster,<span> t</span></span><span>he paternal allele is imprinted by DNA methylation of the imprint control region (ICR), and this methylation also helps suppress gene H19.  The nearby enhancers in the cluster will act on the growth-promoting igf2 and igf2 is expressed.</span></p>
<p><span>The maternal allele has an unmethylated ICR, which allows CTCF (a regulating protein) to bind to it, blocking the enhancers’ access to igf2.  Instead, the enhancers act on H19, and igf2 is silenced.  Thus the normal combined output from both of these alleles is expression of igf2 and H19.</span></p>
<p><span>With a loss of imprinting, the ICR of the maternal allele is methylated, and consequently it acts in the same manner as the paternal allele – the enhancers promote the expression of igf2, and H19 is silenced.  The outcome is that from this cluster, igf2 is over-expressed and H19 is under-expressed.  Excessive expression of igf2 promotes unregulated growth, </span><span>and is directly linked to Wilm’s tumour, a kidney cancer found in children.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span> Methylation is heritable, so epigenetic changes made during the treatment of cells to suppress tumorogenesis will be passed on to daughter cells during mitosis. Therefore, any treated cells will continually reproduce daughter cells in the altered (treated) state.  Epigenenetic drugs that inhibit DNMT will induce passive demethylation through successive daughter cells.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Methylation for development is reset during what is  known as sensitive periods.  During this time the epigenome is being actively re-modelled – methylation being removed just after egg/sperm fertilisation when cells are restored to their pluripotency state through the pre-implatation period, and then during primordial germ cell development in the fetus in the mid-gestation period.</span></p>
<p><span>The epigenome is an interface between the genome and its environment, and is responsive to environmental and pharmaceutical factors not only during development, but also throughout the cell's life.  Alterations to methylation during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because of the risk of disrupting the establishment of methylation marks in differentiation of cells from pluripotent state to fully differentiated. Patients who are likely to be in very early stages of pregnancy, for example, should avoid treatment as the developing embryo could be highly vulnerable.</span></p></div>
