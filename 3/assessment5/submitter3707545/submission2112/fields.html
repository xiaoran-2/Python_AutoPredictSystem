    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation almost exclusively happens at CpG dinucleotide and not at CpG islands, in general they’re hypomethlated. When it comes to Cancer cells, generally the CpG islands are methylated in tumour suppressor genes. CpG island hypermethylation has been described in almost every tumour type. Hypermethylation of CpG islands promoters can result in silencing of those genes, which allows the cells to grow and reproduce uncontrollably leading to tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Majority of the Genome is made up of intergenic regions and repetitive elements which are both usually methylated to maintain genomic stability and integrity. In a cancer cell you will general find that these CpG’s are hypomethylated. Hypomethylation of these CpG’s will cause genomic instability such as chromosomal deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Parent-of-origin-dependent gene expression of <em>Igf2</em> and <em>H19</em> is regulated in <em>cis</em> by the <em>H19 </em>ICR on the maternal chromosome, the unmethylated ICR binds the transcription factor CTCF, and this binding organizes the region into loop domains that prevent <em>Igf2</em> expression by blocking interactions between the <em>Igf2</em> promoters and the downstream enhancers. At the same time, these maternal chromosome-specific loop domains induce enhancer activation of the <em>H19</em> promoter. On the paternal chromosome, methylation of the ICR prevents its recognition by the CTCF protein, thus inducing alternative DNA looping domains that drive <em>Igf2</em> expression by permitting interaction of the <em>Igf2</em> promoter with the shared enhancers. When imprinting leads to the activation on transcription of the normally silent maternally inherited Igf2 allele, both Igf2 alleles are expressed which causes over expression which causes disrupted Igf /H19 imprinting which causes Wilms tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The two main drugs on the market to treat cancer at the epigenetic level are Azacitidine and Decitabine, both of these drugs are DNA-demethylating agents which works by inhibiting DNA-methyltransferase at low doses and causing hypomethylation at higher dosages. Azacitidine works both on DNA and RNA whereas Decitabine only works on DNA. There is speculation that these epigenetic drugs alter the tumour cells in some lasting way that makes them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect due to epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, they don’t return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop cancer growth without having to kill all its cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation alteration with drugs have an enduring effect on the epigenome because the epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to the daughter cell and the granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are times during development where drugs, environment and other things can have an effect on our epigenome and our Genetic make-up, a couple of this periods are in utero, pre-teen (during puberty) and pregnancy. Treating patients during these sensitive periods of development is inadvisable as it can have lasting effects to not just our epigenome, but also our grandchildren’s. </p></div>
