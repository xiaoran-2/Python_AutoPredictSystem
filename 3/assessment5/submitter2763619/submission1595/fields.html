    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;">DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine base in the DNA and in general is associated with gene repression. This process is carried out by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) enzymes and is almost exclusively found in the context of a cytosine followed by a guanine (CpG). The genome-wide DNA methylation pattern in all cells of the body is bimodal, with the majority of CpG dinucleotides modified at high levels, and CpG islands largely unmethylated. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The CpG islands found in the gene promoters tend to be protected from methylation. The lack of methylation is associated with open chromatin that allows the binding of the transcription machinery. A small subset of CpG islands are methylated such as in imprinted control regions and the inactive X chromosome.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated helping to maintain genomic integrity. In the case of intergenics regions DNA methylation prevent deletions, duplications, translocations and insertions in the chromosomes; and repress transcriptional noise silencing cryptic transcription start sites and splicing sites. The DNA methylation on repetitive elements also maintains genomic stability by silencing transposable elements, avoiding transcriptional interference for strong promoters and prevented illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In cancer, there is a genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, concurrent with a hypermethylation at normally unmethylated CpG islands. The hypermethylation of promoter with CpG islands causes gene silencing, which is particularly important in tumor suppressor genes. The lack of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements induces genomic instability that produce illegitimate recombination, transposition of repetitive elements and activation of cryptic promoters that altered the gene expression; inducing silencing of gene suppressor or activation of  oncogenes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;">Genomic imprinting is the monoallelic gene expression on a parent-of-origin manner. The Igf2-H19 tandem gene is paternally imprinted. Igf2 and H19 coding regions are separated by a differentially methylated region (DMR) that is methylated on the paternal chromosome and unmethylated on the maternal chromosome. Methylation of the DMR on the paternal chromosome prevents binding of CTCF insulator protein and allows the transcription of Igf2 mRNA by an enhancer from the paternal chromosome. In contrast, DMR is unmethylated in the maternal chromosome and allow the binding of CTCF, this mechanism prevents the activation of the Igf2 promoter by its enhancer. As a result, only H19 mRNA is transcribed from the maternal chromosome.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Wilms' tumor, a pediatric kidney malignancy, DMRs within Igf2-H19 are methylated in both, maternally and paternally chromosomes. As a consequence of the ‘loss of imprinting’, there is an increased expression of Igf2 and a decreased expression of H19. Both alterations result in an increase of Ifg2 (a growth factor) that induces uncontrolled cell growth and decreases H19 (a non-coding mRNA), which is a precursor of several microRNAs that negatively affect cell proliferation. Overall these alterations can lead to tumor formation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;">Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that at low doses inactivates the DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT-1) producing DNA demethylation (hypomethylation). The specific incorporation of Decitabine into the DNA causes the degradation of the DNA-DNMT complex, which restores the DNA without methylation and as a result, the DNA methylation pattern can no longer be reproduced toward the daughter strands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The anti-tumoral effect of Decitabine effect can be mediated by re-expression of previously silenced genes by hypermehtylation, in particular in cancers with a methylator phenotype, because contrary to DNA mutations, DNA methylation is reversible.  The reactivation of genes involved in mismatch repair, tumor suppressor genes and cell cycle-regulation could induce cell differentiation, reduce proliferation, and/or increase apoptosis of the daughter cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;">There is a period when the epigenome is more susceptible to epigenetic changes through environmental influences, this sensitive period occur when there is an extensive epigenetic reprogramming that produce removal and resetting of the epigenetics marks. Periods of particular vulnerability include early stages of embryonic development (pre-implantation and implantation) and early life, when the primordial germ cells are developing.  In early embryonic state, the DNA methylation is erased and then reestablished in each individual at the time of implantation through a developmentally regulated program. Although there is a global DNA demethylation, some sequences remains methylated during this period such as tandem repeats and imprinted control regions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Environmental agents that interfere with process that governs reprogramming could disrupt this establishment of epigenetics marks. The treatment of patients with demethylating drugs during sensitive period is inadvisable because the exposure to these drugs during early pregnancy can alter the establishment of epigenetic marks and produce altered methylation patterns that could be mitotically inherited and induce diseases like a cancer in later stages of life. On the other hand, the treatment of patient during childhood, in particular females, can disrupt the epigenetic state of the gametes. The alteration in the epigenetic state of gametes can have a transgenerational effect passing altered epigenetic program to the offspring.</p></div>
