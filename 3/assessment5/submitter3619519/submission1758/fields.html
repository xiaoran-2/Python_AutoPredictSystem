    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is established by specific DNA methyltransferases. It is import for proper embryogenesis and development, sustaining chromosomal stability, telomere length and pre determined gene expression.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in cancer; the promoter CpG islands in cancer cells become type- methylated therefore leading to silencing of underlying gene.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in cancer could be genome wide loss and regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes, silencing of tumor suppressor genes that controls cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair by hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands.</p>
<p>There is high frequency of DNA methylation at the CpG rich sites (that is the CpG island methylator phenotype) in colorectal cancer. There is CpG island stores of approximately 2kb, which is hypermethylated in the colorectal cancer. This region has relation with genes expression, also detected in tumor cells and nerve sheath tumors.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The genes in imprinted areas of an organism genome are expressed depending on the parent of origin. And inheritance of both the maternal and paternal genes is required for normal development to proceed. These two genes (h19/ igf2) are imprinted normally, only in the maternal copies of H19 and the paternal copies of IGF2 are expressed.</p>
<p>H19 is a non- coding RNA of unknown function and can suppress growth factors 2, which is highly expressed in many types of tumors. But in cancer cells both H19 and IGF2 lose their imprinting. It is known that the function of H19 is to turn off IGF2 expression, and then the loss of H19 expression may result in over expression of IGF2 therefore leading to tumor formation. Wilm’s tumor is a result of loss of imprinting of maternal chromosome and a switch to paternal pattern of methylation. H19 mRNA expression leads to a decrease in most wilm’s tumors by approximately 20 folds, therefore this shows that H19 is inactivated in tumor cells. This will result into over expression of H19. Loss of imprinting at the H19/ IGF2 locus results in uncontrolled cell growth that can lead to tumor formation.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor; 2- deoxy- 5- azacytidine. It is for treating myelodysplastic syndromes a precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It reverses epimutations and reactivates epigenetically silenced tumor surpressor genes.</p>
<p>Decitabine effects on DNA methylation; as an analogue, it is incorporated into replicating DNA and they form a covalent bond with DNA methyltransferase. This will lead to passive demethylation during DNA replication and cell division. Decitabine demethylate CGs in a non- CG island more efficiently than those in CG island. Also treatment with decitabine can lead to a non- random and reproducible DNA methylation patterns.</p>
<p>Low dose of decitabine can lead to sustained anti- tumor effects even after treatment discontinued, an active immune response may be induced in the treated patient. Transcient and low dose also result into induction of anti- tumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response that mediates tumor repression.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation leads to epigenetic changes that passed from daughter to granddaughter cells through cell division, till actively erased. And it could be that epigenetic therapies might affect changes which could stop cancer growing without killing all its cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are the periods of epigenetic reprogramming; the alteration or removal of the normal processes that can results in epigenetic abnormalities. Sensitive periods can be early development (fertilised eggs to blastocyst) at IVF culture invitro embryo handling; primordial germ cell (PGC) do not and germ cell harvest. </p>
<p>Treating patients at sensitive periods may results imprinting defects, as a result of disrupted epigenetic reprogramming. Since imprinted genes contribute to growth in placenta. Somatic nucleus that have not been through PGC epigenetic reprogramming ICR is not reset and germ cell genome packaging not attained, ICR methylation erodes at early development reprogramming and lastly PGC cleaning and resetting skipped.</p></div>
