    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands are found at the promoters of genes where the transcription machinery binds.  When the CPG islands are hypermethylated the associated genes are silenced.  In cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands leads to the silencing of tumour supressor genes.  These changes are mitotically heritable leading to the genes of the daughter cells also being supressed.  These cells then have a competitive advantage and divide more rapidly leading to the cancerous state.</p>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated.  This contributes to genomic stability as the DNA is densely packaged and cannot be transcribed.  In cancer cells, these regions are hypomethylated and the DNA is no longer densley packaged.  The euchromatin state allows repetitive elements to line up in an aberrant manner which can result in illegitimate recombinations and reciprocal translocations.  When hypomenthylated, repeats can also be activated to make copies of themselves, transpose and disrupt or activate surrounding genes.  The genomic instability leads to abnormal karyotypes with deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.  In mouse models hypomethylation via the use of Dnmt1in specific tissues has led to the development of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltansferase inhibitor.  It is a cytadine analogue which is incorporated into the DNA.  It can then irreversibly bind DNA methyltransferase to it.  The result is that available DNA methyltransferase is reduced.  One mechanism for the development of cancer is hypermethylation of CpG islands associated with tumour supressor genes and the silencing of these genes.  If DNA methyltransferase is not available, methylation at CpG islands does not take place and the tumour supressor genes can be expressed with a resultant reduction in tumour growth.  This process is dependent on cell replication.  Cancer cells are rapidly dividing and will be most susceptible to the actions of the Decitabine. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Patterns of DNA methylation are mitotically heritable meaning that they will be passed on to daughter cells.  The impact of drugs which alter DNA methylation in the parent cell will therefore be seen in future generations of that cell line even if the drug is no longer being administered.</p>
<p>In terms of epigenetics, sensitive periods are when epigenetic marks are being established rather than maintained.  Sensitive periods of development are primarily during embryogenesis and gametogenesis.  During these periods cells are pluripotent or are becoming differentiated into different tissue types via epigenetic processes.  Cancer cells are susceptible to treatments targeting the epigenome due in part to their similarities to pluripotent cells.  Treatment with drugs that alter DNA methylation during sensitive periods would be more likely to result in unwanted effects.  Any alterations in the epigenome caused by the drug would be mitotically heritable throughout the development of the organism.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the imprint control region of the paternal allele is methylated. The insulator element CTCF cannot bind to the ICR and the enhancers are then able to act on Igf2 which is expressed.  On the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated and the CTCF insulator element can bind to it. This results in the enhancers acting on H19 which is expressed.  Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the ICR on the maternal allele is methylated.  CTCF does not bind resulting in IGF2 expression from the maternal allele.  As is commonly found with imprinted genes, the H19/Igf2 cluster is involved in cell growth.  When the gene is expressed from both maternal and paternal allele the double dose effect results in tumour growth - in this case Wilm's tumour.</p></div>
