    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands serves as a gene silencing mechanism, as CpGs typically contain promoters of genes. Typically, these islands are protected from methylation, but in cancer, there is generally an abnormally large amount of DNA methylation of CpG islands, leading to hypermethylation in those regions. IF the methylation silences genes that would normally check growth and suppress tumors, disease and result. Normally, silencing intergenic regions and the repeats ensures genomic stability and prevents instabilities that may lead to apoptosis or uncontrolled cell growth. In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated, resulting in instabilities that lead to characteristics we see in this diesease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the gene for CTCF protein, which insulates the upstream igf2 from enhancer binding, is methylated. This methylation spreads downstream to also methylate H19, and because of the absense of CTCF, Igf2 is expressed. In the maternal allele, the imprint control region at the CTCF is not methylated and therefore neither is the downstream h19; the expression of CTCF leads to silencing of igf2. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele is abnormal and behaves like the paternal allele. This means that there's an upregulation of igf2, which happens to ben an oncogene and can therefore lead to inappropriate growth promotion that predisposes the carrier of such abnormality to early childhood tumors. This is one exmaple of how disease can arise from imprinting disruption of this H/19/Igf2 complex. In addtion, loss of imprinting of this H19/Igf2 complex can lead to abnormalities such as fetal and post-natal overgrowth as effected by the overexpression of igf2. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent that works by demethylating the genetic regions that are abnormally methylated. As cancer can arise when certain regions, such as CpG islands, get overmethylated, these demethylating agents can reverse the anti-tumour effects by removing methyl groups from those regions. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation on the genome of a tumor cell can either activate or inactivate certain genetic regions that can lead to silencing or turning-on of genes or other places such as imprint control regions. These changes in turn can affect the whole epigenome permanently. </p>
<p>A sensative period is the period during which epigenetic reprogramming occurs. This can occur during pre-implantation development and germ cell development. Treating patients during sensitive patients may permanently alter the epigenome of the patient and result in unwanted side effects. </p></div>
