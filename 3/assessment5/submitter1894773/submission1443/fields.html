<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>The normal function of DNA methylation in CpGs is to reduce gene expression, especially in adult somatic cells. Unmethylated CpGs are often found in groups called CpG islands, present in many 5' regulatory regions of genes. Their function is to promote gene transcription. In cancer, CpG islands hypermethylate resulting in the silencing of the transcription of genes and loss of imprinting. These hypermethylations can be inherited by the daughter cells. These hypermethylated promoters in front of tumor suppressor genes can result in enhanced and uncontrolled growth. Hypermethylation contributes to the development and/or progression of various diseases such as retinoblastoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer and gliomas and colorectal tumours. In these examples, single genes (RB, MLH1, BRCA1, MGMT) result in the hypermethylation of CpG islands, which cause the uncontrolled  growth and division of cells. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, CpGs are often methylated in the normal cell. One of their function is to silence these regions and prevent either their transcription or encourage their splicing in mRNA. Another function is to suppress the expression of endogenous retroviral genes and other harmful stretches of DNA. In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated resulting in genomic instability. Genomic instability will effect the recombination between repeats, the activation of repeats and transposition, and the activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes. One result could be an abnormal karyotype. In mice, hypomethylation can be achieved by the deletion of Dnmt1 in certain types of tissues. This results in genomic instability. In humans, mutations in DNA-methyltransferase-3b gene result in ICF syndrome. ICF syndrome is a very rare recessive immune disorder, characterized by the reduction in serum immunoglobulin.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the methylation of the imprint control region prevents the binding of the CTCF (an insulator protein, which acts to insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers). Thus enhancers can activate the expression of Igf2 and DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, silencing its expression.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the ICR isn't methylated, resulting in the binding of CTCF. CTCF blocks the access of downstream enhancers to Igf2. Also, the H19 promoter region doesn't get methylated, so that transcription of H19 is activated. The enhancers act on H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, there is an overexpression of Igf2, because of the methylation of the ICR in the maternal allele. Therefore, CTCF cannot bind to either allele. This results in the development of cancer in the kidneys. The disease occurs typically in children. </p>
<p>Overexpression of Igf2 can cause hypoglycemia (in islet cells) and overgrowth, whereas overexpression of H19 can cause various cancer and is associated with genome instability </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is chemically a cytidine analog and is a hypomethylating (DNA-demethylating) agent by inhibithing DNA methyltransferase. It incorporates itself into DNA and acts similar to azacitidine by interfering with DNA methylation. It can have an anti-tumour effect by demethylating regions of hypermethylation in tumour cells, such as CpG islands in promoter regions of tumour-suppressor genes. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When altering DNA methylation, it can have enduring effects, since DNA methylation can be passed on to daughter cells in cell division. Therefore, changing the epigenetic makeup of the parent cell will have an effect on the daughter cells. </p>
<p>During sensitive periods, it should be avoided to treat patients with epigenetic drugs. Sensitive periods in development are periods during which DNA methylation changes drastically in the paternal and maternal genome. These periods are usually marked by a large decrease in DNA methylation. Also sensitive periods can be understood as the time when epigenetic control is most sensitive to the environment.</p>
<p>Early development is a sensitive period during which the fertilised egg form into a blastocyst. Germ cell development is another sensitive period. Childhood before puberty and during puberty (age: 8-12) can also be seen as a sensitive period.</p>
<p>It would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods, since the reaction and side effects of a drug amount cannot be estimated easily. There can be effects on the epigenome that will effect the normal development of the patient during the sensitive period.  </p></div>
