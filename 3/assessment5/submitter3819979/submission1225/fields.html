    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a mechanism used for silencing gene expression and maintaining genomic stability. It is very important as there are large amounts of repetitive sequences in DNA which, if not silenced could bring about diseases such as cancer. This can occur by the activation of aberrant recombinations that cause transcriptional deregulation of neighboring genes, as well as the activation of transpositions and cryptic promoters.

DNA methylation patterns undergo many changes in cancer, one of them being hypomethylation, where the total number of methylated cystosines decreases. DNA methylation occurs at intergenic regions as well as repetitive elements to maintain genomic integrity by preventing deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions and transpositions. So, when hypomethylated, these regions lead to the formation of illegitimate recombinations that create genomic instability and thus cancerous cells.

A CpG island is where you find more C-G dinucleotides than expected and they are usually unmethylated. In cancerous cells, however, they are found to be hypermethylated so as to silence tumor suppressor genes that are found in within them.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, a DNA-demethylating agent (DNA methyl transferase inhibitor) that targets epigenetic machinery, is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, which has progressed to acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). AML is dependent on CpG island hypermethylation. 

Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue so it becomes included in DNA upon replication. Once included in DNA, Decitabine binds irreversibly to DNA methyl transferase which then prevents DNA methyl transferases from further methylating CpG islands. This leads to an anti-tumor effect as the CpG islands (now unmethylated, thus not silenced) can express tumor suppressor genes that prevent any uncontrolled cell growths. 

As Decitabine targets epigenetic machinery, changes that occur within cells can be passed onto further generations of daughter cells. This is favorable, as once the changes are erased after passing through many daughter cell generations, they do not return.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes that occur in cells may be passed on to further generations of cells because epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, are mitotically heritable. Therefore, methylation is a stable epigenetic mark as DNA methylation will be copied by DNMT1 (an enzyme), onto the new daughter strands. This allows drugs that alter DNA methylation to have effects that last beyond the period of treatment as through continuously dividing, the daughter cells will maintain these new modifications. However, these epigenetic modifications will not be maintained during periods of epigenetic reprogramming, also known as sensitive periods. Instead, new epigenetic marks will be established. There are two phases of this epigenetic reprogramming. 

The first is during the pre-implantation period. During this period, DNA methylation and histone marks are removed from the genome until the blastocyst stage. This restores totipotency which can then ensure that the right embryonic genes are expressed during the resetting of embryonic epigenetic marks. The second, occurs during primordial germ cell development, where cells go on to become the eggs or sperm, depending on the sex of the embryo. Somatic marks are removed and specialized germ cell chromatins, as well as particular epigenetic signatures are laid down.

As a result of this reprogramming, treating patients with drugs that can alter DNA methylation during either one of these sensitive periods would evidently be inadvisable. This is due to the fact that during reprogramming, epigenetic marks are removed from the DNA to restore totipotency so any modifications made by the drugs would be erased during the reprogramming and would not be passed onto further cell generations.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations of DNA methylation at imprint control regions (hypomethylation or hypermethylation) can result in the loss of expression of growth restricting genes, resulting in the over expression of growth promoting genes. This is commonly an early event that can often be seen in pre neoplastic tissue, such as in the over expression of the H19/IGF2 genes, which lead to the development of a Wilm’s tumor. 

The IGF2 gene (insulin-like growth factor 2) has a vital role in the growth and development of a fetus leading to its birth, as does H19, a gene within the same cluster as IGF2.  Despite the IGF2 gene being distinctly active throughout fetal development, it does not play such a big role in an adult. 

A person typically inherits one copy of genes from their mother and one copy from their father. However, in the case of the IGF2 gene, the paternal copy is the active copy in most of the body, this is known as genomic imprinting. Genomic imprinting occurs when certain genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin specific fashion. Parent specific genomic imprinting of both IGF2 and H19 clusters is controlled by a H19 differentially methylated region.

Increased activity of the IGF2 gene has been associated with many types of embryonal tumors. This is caused by both the maternal and paternal copy of the gene being activated and is known as the loss of imprinting. Large quantities of IGF2 may cause the development of tumor cells and stop any aberrant cells from being destroyed. These tumors include a type of kidney cancer known as Wilm’s tumor.
