    <div class="field-value"><div>"DNA methylation at promoter regions is inversely correlated to gene expression (see Hassler/Egger, Biochimie. 2012 November; 94(11): 2219–2230, doi: 0.1016/j.biochi.2012.05.0072012). However CpG islands are different, which are found in 60 % in promoter regions (see Hassler/Egger, 2012):„In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene” (Hassler/Egger, 2012).</div>
<div>The DNA methylation within promoter regions of genes is negatively correlated with expression levels of the gene except in CpG islands, which are normally kept free of methylation (Hassler/Egger, 2012, fig. 1).</div>
<div>"The altered nuclear morphology of cancer cells is associated with re-arranged active and inactive territories and chromatin, global DNA demethylation and local DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands, which results in silencing of underlying genes” (see Figure 3 of Hassler/Egger, 2012).</div>
<div>"Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been identified at intergenic sites outside protein-coding genes containing H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 domains. Many of these biological active lincRNAs can physically associate with chromatin remodeling complexes such as PCR2 and are needed for pluripotency and differentiation" (Hassler/Egger, 2012).</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine is a „DNA-demethylating agent[s], in the form of a zacitidine“ (see Economist).</div>
<div>Therefore it demethylates DNA.</div>
<div>Since the epigenetic makeup of cells is changed to more DNA-methylation a demethylating drug can counter-act the tumor motor and thereby make cells more normal again.</div>
<div>Methylation of DNA makes it less useful (it cannot be transcribed and therefore it is quiet – the genes in question will remain quiet, e.g. tumor-suppressor genes).</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is inherited by cell devision in somatic cells and the blood.</div>
<div>DNA methylation results in making genes quiet, because methylated DNA is packed densly and not transcribed.</div>
<div>Sensitive periods are times in which the methylation and other epigenetic changes to the DNA are reversed, e.g. for the creation of oocytes and sperm cells and also the early development of the fetus.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When treating patiens during these sensitive periods the drugs will be changed and the inherited methylated DNA is also altered.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The effect of epigenetic drugs is apparently that they could alter cancer cells from DNA methylation back to less methylated DNA. And these altered cells could be better attacked by the conventional chemotherapeutic drugs.</div>
<div> </div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>See the review paper from Abramowitz/Bartolomei, Curr Opin Genet Dev. 2012 April, 22(2): 72–78.</p>
<p>"The maternally-expressed H19 gene and paternally-expressed Igf2 gene share enhancers and their reciprocal imprinting is governed by a CTCF-dependent insulator that is located between the genes. On the maternal allele in mouse, CTCF binds to 4 binding sites within the ICR, generating an insulator that prevents Igf2 from accessing the shared enhancers that are located on the H19 side of the insulator. Thus, the insulator effectively acts as an enhancer-blocker. On the paternal chromosome, methylation at the ICR not only prevents CTCF from binding, allowing Igf2 to engage the enhancers, but it is also required for methylation at the H19 promoter and silencing of H19" (page 2). Important are the two genes: "maternally expressed H19 and paternally expressed Igf2 genes. On the maternal allele the ICR remains unmethylated allowing CTCF and its cofactors (cohesins and  p68/SRA) to bind. This interaction mediates enhancer blocking allowing downstream enhancers to access the H19 promoter. Paternal methylation at the ICR prevents CTCF binding and together with methylation at the H19 promoter allows the enhancers to access Igf2. " (figure 2a on page 11). Wilms-Tumor is depending from the gene WT-1 and WT-2 (see Dome/Huff, 2006, GeneReviews).</p></div>
