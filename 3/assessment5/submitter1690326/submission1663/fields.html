    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>While in ordinary cells the CpG islands are left unmethylated to maintain genomic integrity and ensure stablility, in cancer cells these CpG islands are methylated and therefore unexpressed.  Because CpG methylation is an epigenetic mutation and therefore mitotically heritable, it has a tremendous impact on disease.  Most often, tumor suppressor genes are methylated, allowing tumors to accumulate without proper regulation.  One gene effected is RB in the eye cancer known as retinoblastoma.  CpG methylation can also be tracked as a biomarker among similar cells, in order to point out cancerous cells.  In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated and unexpressed, while in cancer the opposite is true.  This abnormality is known as hypomethylation, rather than the aforementioned hypermethylation.  Hypomethylation leads to illegitimate recombinations and other forms of genomic instability.  When superfluous genes are activated, tumorigenesis is accelerated as a result, leading to chance of disease.  Overall, this reversal of the natural genetic order--methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions, as well as the unmethylation of CpG islands--wreaks havoc on otherwise healthy cells and leads to the development of often malignant cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of a paternally imprinted gene.  In this case, the maternal h19 is unmethylated, and the paternal Igf2 is methylated.  CTCF is present on the maternal allele to prevent methylation from spreading to H19 and preventing Igf2 from activating.  When abnormalities occur in the imprinting of this cluster, tumors develop.  An example of this is Wilm's Tumor, an affliction of the kidneys that typically occurs in childhood.  Numerous imprinting errors, if they cause the maternal allele to behave like the paternal allele, can lead to the development of Wilm's tumor.  One such error is the upregulation of Igf2 and the loss of the tumor suppressor Cdkn1c.  Because imprinted genes are closely tied to growth, the disruption of imprinting is often tied to cancer.  For instance, when DNA methylation is lost in ICRs (imprint control regions), this leads to abnormal growth and the development of malignant tumors.  Overall, the H19/Igf2 is just one of many imprinted genes, that if tampered with, can cause disease in an otherwise healthy organism.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of the few epigenetic drugs on the market, and is an example of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor, meant to slow tumor growth in otherwise cancerous cells.  By reducing histone methylation considerably, tumor growth slows as a result, without affecting the health of neighboring cells.  By reducing overmethylation, tumor suppressor genes can be properly activated and can perform their duties effectively.  Therefore, these new drugs such as Decitabine can have dramatic effects on the proliferation of cancer by using epigenetic means.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, changes made can affect future daughter cells, and these changes include DNA methylation.  This is especially true during sensitive periods, in which marks are established instead of maintained.  These marks occur at two pivotal points, early embryonic development and the generation of primordial germ cells.  Because the immediate effects of cancer do not affect future generations, altering the epigenome during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable, for fear of adverse effects on future generations.  These marks need to be removed at appropriate times in order for normal development to take place.</p></div>
