    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normally functioning cells, CpG islands tend to be found in the promotors of genes and are generally unmethylated. If you do find methylation in a CpG island, it is usually correlated with silencing of gene expression, based on the closing of the chromatin structure and prevention of transcription factor binding. In cancer, the CpG islands and the shores of CpG islands (most notably the tumor suppression genes) are hypermethylated, causing them to be silenced. Silencing of tumor suppression genes allows cancer tumors to grow.</p>
<p>In normally functioning cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated and therefore inactivated. In cancer, these intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated. This can lead to the activation of repeats and transposition, where they can make copies of themselves and jump around the genome, leading to increased incidence of genetic deletions, additions, and reciprocal translocations. Because methylation may have been keeping the chromatin closed, its demethylation may also cause the chromatin to open up and alignment of repeats could lead to illegitimate recombination. These both lead to general genomic instability. This genomic instability is related to tumorogenesis and cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Igf2 gene is normally only expressed from the allele inherited from the father. There is an imprint control region which is bound by an insulator protein called CTCF. On the paternal allele, this imprint control region is methylated and on the maternal allele, it is unmethylated. On the paternal allele, when it's methylated, the CTCF insulator protein cannot bind to it, methylation spreads to the H19 long noncoding RNA, and nearby enhancers are freely available to bind to Igf2 and be expressed. On the maternal allele, the imprint control region is unmethylated and the CTCF insulator protein can bind to it, insulating and preventing expression of Igf2 and the enhancers act instead on H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, both the paternal and the maternal allele is methylated (the maternal allele is actually hypermethylated), allowing both alleles to express Igf2, leading to a double-dosage of Igf2. This overexpression of the Igf2 growth factor is associated with Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. They are incorporated into the DNA during replication and when DNA methyltransferase goes to copy the methylation to the daughter cells, it is irreversibly bound and unable to be released. It is dependent on cell division. In cancer, tumor cells tend to divide and replicate much more rapidly than regular cells and so are a good target for such drugs. The effect of these type of drugs is DNA de-methylation. This reverses the hyper-methylation described in Q1 and may allow for tumor suppression genes to be expressed.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. It is copied from a parent cell to a daughter cell by DNMT1. Sensitive periods are times when epigenetics are reprogrammed, like during early embryonic development as well as germ cell development. During these times, the epigenetic marks accumulated so far are removed. If patients are treated with drugs which disrupt the epigenetic machinery during such sensitive periods, this disruption is also likely to affect the normal removal of epigenetic marks, laying down of new marks, or reading of existing epigenetic marks and cause abnormal reprogramming functionality.</p></div>
