    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer. The remarkable characteristics are: genome-wide hypomethylation and locus specific hypermethylation. CpG islands are genomic regions that contain high frequency of CpG dinucleotides with a minimum of 200 bp, more than 50 % of GC and an observed-to-expected CpG ratio greater than 60%. CpG islands are found in approximately 60 % of promoters and normally lack of methylation. In normal cells, unmethylated CpG islands correlate with active tumor suppressor genes, preventing the development of neoplastic mass. However, DNA hypermethylation is observed at introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributing to maintain the genomic stability in normal cells. In cancer, CpG island hypermethylation constitutes an alternative to genetic mutation in order to silence tumor suppressor genes, and becomes one of the hits in Knudson's hypothesis as well. The inactivation of tumor suppressor genes promotes hyperplasia and metastasis, both typical events of cancer. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable but reversible–unlike mutations–, a relevant aspect for the treatment of neoplasia. CpG island shores constitute ±2kb neighboring CpG islands; methylation status in these regions correlates well with gene expression, as in normal tissue differentiation. It raises the question whether CpG island shore methylation (hyper or hypo methylation) is a better predictor of gene expression than CpG island methylation. Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation is one of the oldest epigenetic abnormality found in the early 80's. The consequence of DNA hypomethylation relies on location. Hypomethylation in repeats and intergenic intervals increase genomic instability through improper recombination between repetitive elements, activation of repeats and transposons, and triggering of cryptic promoters with disruption of neighboring genes. These events yield abnormal karyotypes–insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocations–that produce or contribute to the establishment of several pathologies, like mutation in DNMT3B, which produces ICF (Immunodeficiency-Centromeric instability-Facial anomalies) syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR located between Igf2 and H19 genes is patternally imprinted, thus it is methylated and unmethylated in the paternal and maternal chromosomes, correspondingly. The methylation of the paternal ICR prevent the binding of the CTCF protein and produce the spread of DNA methylation to the H19 promoter, silencing the H19 promoter and permitting the action of the enhancer in the Igf2 promoter which results in the expression of the Igf2 gene. Contrarily, the unmethylated maternal ICR allows the CTCF binding to occur, blocking the access of the enhancer to the Igf2 promoter. Consequently, the enhancer binds to the H19 promoter by secondary affinity, producing the expression of H19 gene in the maternal chromosome. In Wilms tumor, bi-allelic expression of <em>Igf2</em> has been reported in association with gain of methylation at the correspondent ICR on the maternal allele. Briefly, both chromosomes act as paternal, resulting in overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth promoter gene. Deletion/ mutation, uniparental disomy and epigenetic disruption can cause diseases as a consequence of loss of imprinting. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is another example of imprinting abnormalities with loss of function in a tumor suppressor gene (Cdkn 1c) and upregulation of an oncogene (Igf2).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent classified as DNMTi (DNA Methyl Transferases inhibitors). It acts as a nucleoside analogue, which is incorporated into the DNA during replication and binds irreversible to the DNMT at the time of copy of methylation; therefore it is cell division dependent. Consequently, cancer cells–which divide faster–are more affected than normal cells. When most of the DNMTs have been taken, new cells will not have available transferases to establish methylation, and DNA methylation decreases. Currently, Decitabine is used in low doses to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Due to its toxicity and previous study results, Decitabine is used at small dosage. Decitabine effectiveness against myelodysplastic syndromes can be explained by the dependency of those in CpG island hypermethylation. Decitabine anti-tumor effect could be related to hypomethylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters that will activate them, preventing the formation of carcinomas.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation alterations can have a lasting effect–even beyond the treatment period–because they are mitotically heritable. DNA methylation passes on to daughter and granddaughter cells during cell division until they are actively erased in the presence of DNMTi. Once DNA methylation has been erased, it does not come back. Sensitive period is a lapse of time during organism development in which the genome suffers active epigenomic remodeling; most of the epigenomic marks are removed and then re-established. During those periods the genome is more sensitive to alterations in the environment as well. There are two sensitive periods, the first is from embryo pre-implantation until early post implantation and the second is during primordial germ cells development and gametes formation. In females, the maturation of oocytes extends the sensitive period until the adolescence. Treating patients during those terms is not advisable due to the severe undesirable effects that the treatment could have later in their lives or even in next generations. As an example, lack of DNMTs (generated by DNMTi treatment) during sensitive periods will prevent the establishment of normal DNA methylation, producing aberrant epigenomic modifications (abnormal X chromosome inactivation or genomic imprinting), causing several pathological states, as well.</p></div>
