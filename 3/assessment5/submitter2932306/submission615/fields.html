    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in normal cells assures the proper regulation of gene expression and stable gene silencing. CpG islands are found at the promoters of the genes and in general they are unmethylated. Methylated CpG islands are associated with gene silencing and are responsible for the condensation of the chromatin. They are bound by methylated CpG binding proteins (MecP1 and MeCP2) which can alter transcription because they possess a transcriptional repression domain. Methyleted CpG islands stop a transcription factor binding so gene transcription is unable to be done.</p>
<p>DNA hypomethylation in cancer cells promote tumourigenesis by transcriptional activation of oncogenes and loss of imprinting. Gain of CpG methylation can also be a feature of cancer cells. Methylated cytosines are highly unstable bases aand this will predispose to gene mutation as the methylated cytosines are converted to thymine. This conversion can lead to inactivation of tumour suppressor genes (TSGs). In addition, TSGs’ promoter methylation can cause silencing of expression of this gene.</p>
<p>DNA methylation also occurs in intergenic intervals and repetitive elements. The functions of DNA methylation of these features are to maintain genomic integrity and stability. DNA methylation of intergenic intervals helps maintain the expression of the genes that need to transcribe and do some silencing of expression of a cryptic promoter or a cryptic splice site. The repetitive elements are associated with methylated CpG’s. This methylation cause silencing of repeats to prevent transposition or avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, mutation of the repeats to prevent transposition and prevention illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, intragenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated. So there are genomic instability, reciprocal translocation, mutations, increase (or decrease) amount of DNA in the genome, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes (c.f. <em>A</em>vy and <em>Axin</em>fu alleles).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf 2 cluster is involved in imprinting disruption and linked on human chromosome 11.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is on the paternal chromosome while the maternal one is unmethylated.</p>
<p>A long noncoding RNA, called H19, is produced from the maternal allele and is bound by CTCF, an insulator protein, in unmethylated ICR in the maternal allele. So it insulates CTCF's binding insulate Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. These enhancers enhance H19 expression on the maternal allele causing a chromatin looping between the enhancers and Igf2. However, when CTCF blocks this by its binding, the enhancers loop to H19 to enhance H19 expression.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele when ICR is methlyated, CTCF cannot bind to the enhancers. So these enhancers act on Igf2 and promote Igf2's expression from the paternal allele. The reason that H19 is no longer active on the paternal allele is because of DNA methylation which is found at the ICR and spreads downstream into the H19 promoter causing silencing.</p>
<p>Igf2 is an oncogene and promotes embryonic or childhood tumor growth such as Wilms tumor which is found in the kidney. The loss of imprinting and over expression of growth promoting genes due to loss of DNA methylation at ICRs is a cause of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation, may alter epigenetic homeostasis by direct or indirect mechanisms. Direct effects may be caused by drugs which affect chromatin architecture or DNA methylation while indirect effects may be caused by drugs which have transcription factor activity. A two-tier mechanism is postulated for indirect effects in which acute exposure to a drug influences signaling pathways that may lead to an alteration of transcription factor activity at gene promoters. This stimulation results in the altered expression of receptors, signaling molecules, and other proteins necessary to alter genetic regulatory circuits. With more chronic exposure, cells adapt by a process that results in more permanent modifications to DNA methylation and chromatin structure, leading to enduring alteration of a given epigenetic network. Therefore, any epigenetic side-effect caused by a drug may persist after the drug is discontinued. However there are periods of development that treatment with these drugs must be avoided.  So the period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms seems to be one sensitive period. The second sensitive period is the pre-implanted and early post implantation. Both of these are periods of active remodeling of the epigenome so changes caused by drugs would be permanent and treating patient is inadvisable.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine is the cytosine analogue 2’-deoxy-5-axacydine and it is a DNA methyltransferases inhibitor. The inhibitor traps DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and target these enzymes for degradation. DNA synthesis in the absence of these enzymes results in hypomethylation in the daughter cells and eventually to reactivation of silenced gene expression. </p>
<p>Decitabine has an anti-cancer effect by reducing the telomerase activity in cells accompanied by down-regulation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). The hTERT promoter and other regulating genes, such as c-myc, p15, p16, p21, E2F1, and WT1, are not methylated and so their transcription is suppressed avoiding tumor growth.</p></div>
