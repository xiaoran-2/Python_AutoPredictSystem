    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methhylation of GpG islands in the promoter regions is normally associated to gene silencing in normal conditions. What is observed in cancer is that CpG islands in the promoter regions are hypermethylated and the CpG in the intergenic regions are hypomethylated (genome wide hypomethylation). this can contribute to genomic instability (hypomethylation of CpG intergenic regions) and much more gene silencing of Tumor suppressor genes (hypermethylation in CpG islands of Tumor suppressor promoter genes and this is considered as an alternative to mutations in tumor suppressor genes). The normal  function of DNA methylation is to prevent abnormal translocations (chromatine more packed with methylation). In cancer Intergenic regions are hypomethilated causing genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The problem arises with the loss of imprinting (ICR - Imprinted Control regions). it can cause a gain of function in the second copy of a parental allele that should have stayed silent. in the case of igf2 wich is a gene promoting cell growth, this can cause abnormnal growth. the methylation of ICR in pathernal allele prevents CTCf from binding to it. this cause the enhancers to promote igf2 transdcription. In mathernal allele non methylated ICR allows CTCF to bind to it. this prevents enhancers to bind and promote igf2 transcription, promoting instead H19. This way in normal condition we have one copy of igf2. by disrupting this and methylating also ICR in mathernal allele, CTCF can no longer bind to it so enhancers bind and promote both alleles.igf2 is a gene promoting cell growth, this can cause abnormal proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It contributes to reduce of DNA methylation. this can enhnace tumor suppressor genes expression by reducing their promoter hypermethylation. By combining<span>n a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine (DNA De-methylating agent) can slow tumour growth in some cases with advanced lung cancer. Hystone -deacetylase inhibitor can reduce overall gene expression because the less acetylation makes  Histons more "attractive" for DNA turning the chromatine in a more packed form.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>epigenomics marks are mitotically inheritable.</p>
<p>a sensitive period is when epigenetcs reprogramming occurs.</p>
<p>sensitive periods are:</p>
<ol><li>pre implantation period - early development; </li>
<li>Primordial germ cell development</li>
</ol><p>would be inadvisable because this kind of treatment could change epigenome in a lasting way by erasing or changing epigenetic marks. Interfering in sensitive period could lead to unpredictable consequences</p></div>
