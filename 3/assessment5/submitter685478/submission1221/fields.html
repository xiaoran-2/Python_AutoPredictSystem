    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG sites are regions of DNA where a cytosine occurs next to a guanine. Cytosine can be methylated  through enzymatic enzymes known as methyltransferases which results in conversion of cytosine to a thymine disrupting the DNA transcriptional transfer.  This usually results in turning a gene off, which is required in normal biological development.. However, in some cases these mutations can go awry as over-methylation can occur leading to diseases such as cancer.(1)</p>
<p>CpG islands are regions within the genome where there are higher concentrations of CpG sites. In addition, while most CpG sites are methylated in normal cells, unmethylated sites are usually clustered in these islands. As unmethylated genes usually act as promoters, when hypermethylation occurs promoters can turn off tumor suppressors, resulting in cellular cancer.(2) </p>
<p>In other diseases, such as Rett's Syndrome, hypermethylation which tightly binds the chromatin is replaced by undermethylation resulting in abnormal chromatin remodeling allowing some genes to  potentially mutate and be functionally disabled. (3) </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive regions are stretches of DNA located between genes. They  seem to play a role in maintaining genetic stability by silencing DNA splice and transcription sites. In normal cells when CpG islands are hypomethylated the Intergenic and repetitive regions are hypermethylated. In cancer, however, this is reversed with CpG islands being hypermethylated and the intergenic and repetitive regions being hypomethylated. This is thought to be due to the activating DNA splice and transcription sites resulting in increased potential for mutations, thereby reducing genetic stability.(4) </p>
<p>In another disease, called ICF, an immune deficiency response occurs when genetic instability leads to a mutation in a DNMT gene. As these genes are involved in methylation, their silencing can lead to genetic instability as the protective influence of methylation is thwarted.(5) </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation (either hypo or hypermethylation) can result in loss of expression in growth restricting genes and over expression of growth promoting genes. One such growth promoting gene is Igf2 which, as an expression of mono allelic, parent-of-origin imprinting, is particularly interesting. Igf2 as a growth promoting gene is normally expressed from the paternal side, while expression from the maternal side is usually silenced.  This is because the paternal imprinting region is methylated silencing a gene called H19 allowing "Enhancers" to activate the Igf2 whereas the maternal imprinting region is unmethylated allowing H19 to be expressed directing "Enhancers" to concentrate on H19, thus keeping the maternal Igf2 gene silenced. (1)</p>
<p>As Igf2 is a controlled growth enhancing gene (too much of a good thing can can lead to disorders), a loss of imprinting that results in a double dose (both maternal and paternal activation) can lead to  a cancer called Wilm's tumor, a childhood disease of the kidney. (1)</p>
<p>Because imprinting loss can disrupt development of pre-neoplastic tissue, a broad array of tumor types can occur suggesting that such imprinting disorders can be instrumental in very early stages of a broad array of tumor types. (1)</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a an epigenetic inhibitor identified as a DNA-methytransferase inhibitor (or a hypomethylating agent)</span>.  Hypomethylating agents function by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Because methylation of chromatin usually results in a silencing of genes, unfortunately, at times the genes silenced can include tumor suppressing genes. Because hypomethylating agents act to demethylate DNA, they can activate these tumor suppressing genes, so that drugs such as Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect when applied appropriately.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased this could very well be a path in which Dr Baylin's use of epigenetic drugs that were discontinued could continue to elicit beneficial effects under standard chemotherapy. </p>
<p>A sensitive period is a time during development when an individual is more receptive to specific types of environmental, including drug, influences. In the case of epigenetic functioning one period comes to mind when germ cells are developing. During this period DNA methylation is reduced and in the process of increasing methylation as gametes are produced. Thus one can see how use of a methyltransferase inhibitor during this period could severely hinder normal germ cell development as the normal methylation sequence is being inhibited. This precaution should particularly apply to younger patients and pregnant women.</p>
