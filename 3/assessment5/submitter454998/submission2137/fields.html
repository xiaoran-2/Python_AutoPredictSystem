    <div class="field-value"><p>During DNA methylation a chemical modification takes place which leads to the addition of a Methyl (CH3) group at the carbon 5 position of the cytosine ring. <span>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. </span></p>
<p><span>Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands.</span></p>
<p><span>Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. </span>There are two types of DNA Methylation - <strong>Locus Specific DNA hyper methylation</strong> &amp; <strong>Genome wide DNA hypomethylation</strong>.</p>
<p>In a normal cell what you see is a hypomethylated CpG Island, you find that the genome is methylated at the repetitive elements throughout the intergenic regions. </p>
<p>In cancer cells, the CpG Islands are more likely to be methylated and the rest of the genome including the repetitive elements and the introns become hyper methlated ,this distruption contributes to diseases. </p>

<p>Thus the hyper methylation of intergenic regions causes diseases. </p>
<p>Hypermethylation of CpG Island - Set of genes can cause cancer. So colorectal cancer,gliomas and neuroblastoma belong to this cateogry of cancer. These types of cancers are clinically distinct and are receptive to epigenetic theraphy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine</strong> is an epigentic drug and belongs to a new class of drugs know as<strong> DNA methylating agents </strong>and is sold under the marketing name of <span><strong>Dacogen</strong> and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which is a precurser to a form of <strong>leukamia (A type of blood cancer)</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>DNA methylation</strong> is  a major mechanism that regulates <strong>gene expression</strong> in the cells of our body.When there is an<strong> increase in DNA methylation it can block the activity of suppressor genes</strong> that regulate cell division and growth, when suppressor genes are blocked cell division becomes unregulated allowing for the formation of cancer.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Decitabine is a hypo-methylating agent which inhibits DNA methyltransferase</strong> leading to DNA hypo-methylation. </span>Decitabine works by demethylating of by interering with the methylation of DNA. By the effect of demethylation the normal function of suppresor genes is restored thus regaining control over cell growth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have an effect beyond the drug treatment because in some cases epigentic drugs can alter tumour cells so that they become more susceptible to chemotheraphy but not killing them. These epigenetic changes are the passed on during cell division to daughter and grand daughter cells and are eventually erased.Thus in epigenetic therapy you could stop a cancer from growing without having to kill it's cells. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods refer to that time period  when altered environments have an effect on epigentic controls of the cell. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are when when the the embryo is developing into a fetus.Some of the stages at which is sensitive is as a from the development of primordial germ cells to the production of gametes.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because it would affect normal development and result in abnormalities. This is because epigenetic drugs do not discriminate between cells and can impact both tumor cells and normal healthy body cells during the senstive period.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells usually display a loss of imprinting.This is because Imprinted genes promote or suppress growth in some way or the other.</p>
<p><strong>H19/Igf2 is methylated in the paternal allele and is unmethylated in the maternal allele. </strong></p>
<p>When it is<strong> methylated (paternal allele)</strong> the enhancers can act on the Igf2 because CTCF is not binding to it and cannot insulate it from the enhancers thus <strong>Igf2 is expressed.</strong></p>
<p>When it <strong>unmethylated (maternal allele)</strong> CTCF will bind to the insulater and the enhancers will act on H19 and will not act on Igf2 , thus it will remain<strong> silent and unexpressed. </strong></p>
<p>When there is <strong>loss of imprinting it results in Hypermethylation of imprint control region</strong> and both the maternal and paternal gene now exhibit hypermethylation, this is associated with  Wilm's Tumour ( A type of kidney tumour).</p>
<p>What happens in Wilm's Tumor is that the <strong>disruption of imprinting at H19/Igf2 results in a double dose of Igf2 being expressed</strong> on both the maternal and paternal alleles and since it is growth promoting it is known to cause Wilm's Tumour. </p>
