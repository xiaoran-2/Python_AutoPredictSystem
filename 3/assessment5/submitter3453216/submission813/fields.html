    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, compared with normal cells, we see genome wide hypomethylation and hypermethylation at CpG islands.  The identity of the CpG islands which are hypermethylated is tumor specific.  </p>
<p>In normal somatic cells, CpG islands are not methylated, but repetitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated.  In cancer cells, we see the reverse: there is methylation of CpG islands with hypomethylation of repetitive regions and intergenic regions.  These CpG islands (CGIs) tend to be in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes, and methylation results in a silencing of tumor suppressors.  Turning off tumor suppressor genes gives the cell an advantage over neighboring cells (the cells with silenced tumor suppressor genes can grow in an uninhibited way).  DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so daughter cells will also have silenced tumor suppressor genes.  As a global rule in cancer, tumor suppressor gene silencing from CGI hypermethylation is seen more commonly than mutations in DNA causing cancer.  CGI methylation progresses with time and with stage of tumors.</p>
<p>One of the functions of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic stability (prevent the gain or loss of chromosomes and prevent illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes).  In a normal genome, repetitive elements are methylated and therefore bound up in chromatin.  During mitosis, chromosomes pair up to be distributed to daughter cells.  If repeats are similar to areas on other chromosomes, there may be pairing with wrong chromosomes, and there can be translocations, insertions or deletions.  There is evidence from many cancers that hypomethylation leads to genomic instability.  Translocations can cause promoters to be inserted upstream of oncogenes with their subsequent activation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation of imprint control regions is a common feature of cancer.  Many imprinted genes are involved in growth.  Alterations in DNA methylation at imprint control regions (ICRs) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes.  </p>
<p>An example of imprinted genes is the linked genes H19 and Igf2.  These genes share an ICR which is located between them and upstream from H19.  Normally, the paternal allele is imprinted (the ICR is methylated) and the maternal allele's ICR is not methylated.  CTCF is an insulator protein and binds to the unmethylated ICR.  This insulates the Igf2 gene on the maternal allele from enhancers downstream of H19.  The maternal allele does not express Igf2, but does express H19.  The paternal allele with a methylated ICR cannot bind the insulator (CTCF), and thus the Igf2 gene is activated by the enhancers.  The methylated ICR turns off the paternal H19 gene.  (The paternal allele expresses Igf2, and does not express H19.)</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, there is loss of imprinting and both the maternal AND the paternal alleles have a methylated ICR.  This leads to suppression of expression of H19 and overexpression of Igf2.  Loss of imprinting leads to over and underexpression of genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  It acts as a DNA-demethylating agent.  It is a nucleoside analogue and is incorporated into DNA during replication.  It irreversibly binds to DNA methyltransferase, therefore preventing DNA methylation.  Cancer cells will be more significantly affected by DNA methyltransferase inhibitors than normal cells because they are dividing more rapidly.  This class of epigenetic inhibitors works well for hematologic malignancies because the tumor cells are dependent upon tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation for their growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs like DNA methyltransferase inhibitors affect the epigenetic marks in all cells that are exposed to them.  The effects are likely to be more signficant in cancer cells than normal cells because they are dividing more rapidly and thus replicating DNA more frequently.  Changes in the epigenome are mitotically heritable.  Daughter cells will have the same changes in the epigenome that the original exposed cells have, and will pass these changes on to their daughter cells.  Epigenetic drugs will have an effect on the epigenome for the life of the person.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are times when the epigenetic marks are being laid down de novo.  This occurs two times in the life of an individual: during early embryogenesis (prior to implantation) and again during the development of the primordial germ cells.  Exposure to epigenetic drugs during these times would disrupt the normal patterns of epigenetic marks.  This would result in over and underexpression of genes and most likely abnormalities in differentiation of tissues.  If the dosage of epigenetic drugs were high enough, and given early in gestation, the embryo would most likely not survive.  It would cause sterility in embryos exposed during the development of their primordial germ cells.</p></div>
