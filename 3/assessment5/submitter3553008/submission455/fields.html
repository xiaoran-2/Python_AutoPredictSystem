    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated. CpG islands are typically found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, and methylation is usually associated with silencing of gene expression. In cancer cells, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, which can lead to the suppression of tumor suppressor genes. This would lead to an increased risk of cancer, since tumor suppressor genes normally suppress growth or the development of tumors. This can be one of the "hits" in the Knudson hypothesis, which says that multiple hits (such as decreasing expression of a tumor suppressor or increasing expression of an oncogene) are needed to cause cancer. DNA methylations is mitotically heritable, so they can be passed on as cells divide to form a tumor. Epimutations are also rapidly selected for, so over time, the cells that have this hypermethylation of CpG islands that silences tumor suppressor genes will become more prominent, when compared to normal cells, leading to the development of cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated. DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is associated with the maintenance of genomic integrity, perhaps by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or splice sites, by preventing transposition, avoiding transcriptional interference, or by preventing illegitimate recombination. In cancerous cells, there tends to be genome-wide hypomethylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Hypomethylation of repeats can lead to illegitimate recombination because chromosomes can misalign because of the identical repeat regions. Hypomethylation in these regions can also lead to the activation of transposition, promoters, or the disruption of neighboring genes. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can also lead to the activation of oncogenes, which promote growth and the development of tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the paternal allele ICR of the Igf2/H19 cluster is methylated, while the ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele. On the maternal allele, when the ICR is unmethylated, CTCF binds to it, which allows enhancers to enhance expression of the H19 gene. This results in the silencing of the Igf2 gene and activation of the H19 gene from the maternally inherited allele. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, so CTCF does not bind to it. This leads to the methylation and inactivation of the H19 gene and allows the enhancers to enhance expression of the Igf2 gene on the paternal allele.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, there is methylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele, in addition to the paternal allele. This leads the maternal allele to have a similar methylation pattern to the paternal allele. There is now expression of Igf2 and silencing of H19 on both alleles instead of just on the paternal allele. This leads to twice as much Igf2 as in a normal cell, and since Igf2 promotes growth, this can lead to the development of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic drug Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. Decitabine decreases DNA methylation, and since hypermethylation can lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, this could have an anti-tumor effect. Also, epigenetic drugs are particularly useful because scientists have not discovered effective ways to repair the DNA directly and epigenetic changes are inherited mitotically. Therefore, these epigenetic changes can be inherited and erased in daughter cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effecs on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable. As cells divide, the daughter cells can inherit the methylation patterns of the parent cell, and by repairing the inappropriate methylation patterns, these changes will be propagated through the daughter cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming. The sensitive periods of development are during early development in the blastocyst stage and during the development of primordial germ cells, where epigenetic marks are at a low because of epigenetic reprogramming. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because these epigenetic marks need to be cleared and reset appropriately. If you treat these patients during these times, you will lead to inappropriate epigenetic marks in the blastocyst or germ cells. If these drugs can transfer to from a pregnant mother to her growing infant, this would also be in an inappropriate time to provide these drugs because they could have inadvisable effects on the child or the child's germ cells. </p></div>
