    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually hypomethylated in normal tissue but in cancer they tend to be hypermethylated, causing the silencing of the underlying gene.  CpG islands are found in about 60% of promoters of genes.  In cancer disruption of CpG island DNA methylation  in the promoter regions of genes leads to silencing of the underlying gene. CpG island hypermethylation has been described in almost every tumour type and many cellular pathways are inactivated by this type of epigenetic lesion including DNA repair, cell cycle, apoptosis, cell adherence, and detoxification etc . . .</p>
<p>Intragenic DNA demethylation and repetitive elements play a part in chromatin compartmentalization and gene regulation, i.e. they play a part in the 3D arrangement of DNA within the nucleus.  Intragenic and intergenic regions are widely modulated during physiological processes and disease, and seem to be actively involved in multiple gene regulation processes.   Intragenic DNA methylation may be involved in alternative promoter usage, regulation of short and long non-coding RNAs, alternative RNA processing, and enhancer activity.  This is disrupted in cancer by providing or denying access to genes for transcription or silencing, resulting in over-expression or under-expression of the gene product (protein or RNA).  This in turn leads to silencing of tumour-suppressor genes and the expression of oncogenes.</p>
<p>Approximately half of the human genome is made of repetitive elements.  Hypomethylation of repetitive DNA elements is a common epigenetic event in cancer and although it is believed that this impacts chromosomal and transcriptional stability of the genome, the extent of the contribution of repetitive sequences to the development and progression of human cancers remains to be clarified.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>lncRNAs (Long non-coding RNAs) are involved in imprinting. </p>
<p>In the paternal allele the expressed lncRNA name AIR is correlated with repression or silencing of all three Igf2r/Slc22a2/Slc22a3 genes on the paternal allele.  In addition, Air RNA overlaps just one of these genes in an antisense orientation.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele is required for expressing the three Igf2r/Slc22a2/Slc22a3 genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating drug.  It is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA, and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis.  Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in rapidly-dividing cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of Decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and Decitabine incorporated into DNA.</p>
<p>It is believed that this hypomethylation caused by Decitabine affects the regulation of gene expression, cell cycle, DNA damage, and apoptosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has enduring effects on the epigenome because the epigenetic marks are faithfully maintained for the life of the cell and its daughter cells in a tissue i.e. DNA methylation is mitotically inherited in cell lines.</p>
<p>DNA methylation predominantly occurs during early cellular development in embryos and in the formation of gametes.  These are the periods of greatest sensitivity to environmental effects on the genome and the epigenome.  Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because the enzymes and drugs which have effects on cancers are also having effects on normal cellular processes and therefore may have widespread and devastating consequences on physiology, metabolism and development of a patient.</p></div>
