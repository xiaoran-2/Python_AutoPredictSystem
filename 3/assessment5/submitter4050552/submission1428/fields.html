    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands has the function of preventing the gene next to the island to be transcribed by blocking the promoter, this methylation means that the gene has not to be transcribed. In cancer, you can have CpG islands hypermethilation, this leads to a low genetic expression of a lot of genes, if the unexpressed genes are tumour supressor genes, the probability of having cancer due this disruption is very high. The DNA methylation of the intergenic regions has the function of increase genomic stability by preventing excessive recombination of the repetitive elements, because this recombination is mutagenic due to the change in the genome structure. In cancer, you can have these regions with hypometilation, which leads to genomic instability; the hypomethylation removes the restriction and allows these regions to recombine at any random locus of the genome causing potential mutations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the DNA methylation of H19 prevents the binding of CTCF with the enhancers, this permits the enhancers to act in Igf2, increasing its expression. In the maternal allele, H19 is unmethylated, and CTCF binds to the enhancers of the cluster, preventing them to increase the expression of Igf2. In Wilm's tumour, H19 is hypermethylated in both alleles, causing an overexpression in both alleles of Igf2, this leads to have a double dosage of Igf2, which is a growth promoting gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent; this drug causes hypomethylation to the applied tissues. In the cases that cancer is caused by hypermethylation of CpG islands, hypomethylation can remove this metilation and allow the tumour supressor genes to act, avoiding the tumour formation and growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is spreaded and inherited by mitosis, if the DNA methyltransferase is acting normally. A sensitive period is a period of intense epigenetic reprogramming, included DNA demethylation, During embryo preimplantation and the formation of the germ cells are two sensible periods of development. The appliance of epigenetic drugs in these periods would be potentially harmful, because the re-methylation of the genome is required in these periods for the correct formation of the embryo and the gametes. Avoiding this re-methylation by drugs can lead to embryo malformation or dead during early pregnancy (first period) or to infertility or congenital defects of the progeny in mid-late pregnancy (second period).</p></div>
