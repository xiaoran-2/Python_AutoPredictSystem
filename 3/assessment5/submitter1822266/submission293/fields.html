    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an addition of a methyl group to cytosine at position 5.Almost exclusively happens on cytosines preciding guanine (CpG) in the DNA sequence.The total amount of methylated cytosine is usually decresed (global hypomethylation) simultaneously focal hypermethylation in distint subsets of promoter CpG islands in cancer.CpG dinucleotide is involved in one third of point mutations causing human genetic disorders,so DNA methylation on CpGs plays a protective role by silencing. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated, maintaining genomic integrity and protects from transposable elements. In cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions may cause activation of cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic slice sites to appear leading to abnormal karyotype..At repetitive elements disruption of DNA methylation causes transposition of DNA elements,unwanted transcriptional interference from strong promoters and illegitimate recombination of DNA.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele the imprint control region is methylated(silenced),but at maternal allele this region is unmethelated and bounds to CTCF(insulator protein- thats insulates Igf2 gene) and the enhancers then follow the 2nd pathway by enhancing H19 expression.While on paternal allele methylated region does not bounds to CTCF-insulator and so enhancers  freely act on Igf2 gene. Igf2 is an oncogene and it's overexpression may lead to Wilm's tumor (by a mutation/deletion that causes loss of imprinting,either uniparental disomy-2 copies of the paternal allele or rarely epigenetic disruption for loss of imprinting).As a result there is a higher dossage of the expressed paternal Igf2 oncogene,that is more than normal causing the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents.Decitabine demethylates by inhibiting the activity of  EZH2(enzyme that attaches methyl groups to histone proteins).Mutations make EZH2  overactive on methylating histones  during lympomas,consequently silence of surrounding tumor-suppresor genes.Decitabine has anti-tumour effect by blocking the activity of EZH2. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is established with specific DNA methylotransferases and is required for proper embryogenesis and development, for sustaining chromosomal stability,telomere length and predetermined gene expression states.Sensitive period is the period of epigenetic reprogramming.Clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks occurs in primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development and global hypomethylation with focal hypermethylation (during cancer).Treatment during these periods when DNA is less protected-silenced may lead either genes are demethylated are more prone to mutations with unpredictable results for patients. </p></div>
