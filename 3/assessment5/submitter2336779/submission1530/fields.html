    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the DNA (at cytosines).</p>
<p>In mammals DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively at CpG dinucleotides. Many CpGs are found in what we call CpG islands where you find more CG dinucleotides than expected by chance. CpG islands tend to be found at the promoters of genes. Methylation of a CpG island is synonymous with silencing of gene expression and doesn't tend to occur in normal cells. </p>
<p>While in a normal cell we see hypomethylated CpG islands, at a cancer cell the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. In general CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes and by methylating them a cancer cell is able to inactivate them. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable this is a very good locking down mechanism. These epimulations can be rapidly selected for since this cell has a competitive advantage. Over a period of time the cells that have this epimutation are more likely to divide more rapidly or to not die as much and therefore will take over. </p>
<p><strong></strong>The regions of the genome that tend to be DNA methylated in normal cells are intergenic intervals and the repetitive elements.</p>
<p>The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity. It is also involved in silencing of expression of cryptic promoters to avoid transcriptional interference and silencing of particular splice sites.  </p>
<p>DNA methylation at repetitive elements has a similar function. Repetitive elements make a copy of themselves and paste themselves somewhere else in the genome. This is clearly mutagenic as it may disrupt other genes and there is a drive in the cell to silence them. </p>
<p>In cancer cells intergenic intervals and their repetitive elements are unmethylated and hence we find genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster is controlled by enhancer blocking. It is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele (paternally imprinted). A long non coding RNA is produced, H19, which has a role as a reservoir for a particular micro RNA.</p>
<p>When this imprint control region is unmethylated it is bound by CTCF protein which insulates it from Igf2 binding. The enhances act on H19 and enhance its expression on the maternal allele. </p>
<p>On the paternal allele the imprint control region is methylated, CTCF can no longer bind and the enhances promote Igf2 expression. Thus Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Igf2 is an oncogene. If we have loss of imprinting by mutations or deletions two paternal like alleles are created and thmucho have over expression of Igf2. This can happen when two copies of chromosome 11 are inherited from the father (uniparental paternal disomy) in the Beckwith Wiedermann  syndrome. </p>
<p>Loss of imprinting can also occur because of disruption of those DNA methylation imprint. This predisposes to embryonic or childhood tumors but not to adult tumors (Wilm's tumor in the kidney). Loss of imprinting is a hallmark of cancer. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor which is a nucleoside analog to 5-azacitidine. When the cells replicate it gets incorporated in their DNA and then when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. Cancer cells which are dividing more rapidly than most other cells in the body will be more severely affected. However, they seem to be causing DNA methylation and we don't know the consequences on normal cells. We still don't know if that is their only mechanism of action. They seem to be most effective in MDS and it is speculated that the reason is because they might be dependent on CpG island hypermethylation. They are also in clinical trials for a number of other malignancies including solid tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is heritable for many cell divisions and can be heritable for maybe a 100 years. There are two hypotheses on the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance through gametes: (a) somehow they might be escaping epigenetic reprogramming, (b) there is some sort of messenger molecule in the germ cells that is being transmitted through the gametes.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are when we have active reprogramming of the epigenome. The first is during primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms. The second is the pre implantation and post implantation period. Both of these are periods of active remodeling of the epigenome.</p>
<p>There are also other tissue specific sensitive periods. These are brief windows in time when particular organs undergo tissue specific differentiation.</p>
<p>These new epigenetic drugs are not cancer cell specific and have the potential to affect all cells of the body. Their exact mechanism of action is unknown and they may be  causing many epigenetic alterations that we don't know about. Thus physicians should consider the sensitive periods especially when they are treating younger patients that have developing germ cells and may pass on the epigenetic alterations to the next generation.</p></div>
