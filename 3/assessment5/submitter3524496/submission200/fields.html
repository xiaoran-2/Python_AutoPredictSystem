    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Basically there are 2 types of alteration in DNA methylation in cancer: 1) hypermethylation of CpG islands; and 2) hypomethylation of the genome in general, mainly in intergenic and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>CpG islands are found in promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Therefore, they are hypomethylated in order to maintain those genes active and avoid tumor growth. However, in cancer, those islands are hypermethylated, hence inactivating the genes and promoting cancer development.</p>
<p>In normal cells, the genome is generally methylated in repetitive and intergenic elements in order to maintain imprinting and recombination. Nevertheless, in cancer cells there is a global hypomethylation that promote chromosome instability, probably due to illegitimate recombination, chromosome rearrangements, aneuploidy, loss of imprinting, activation of repeats and transposable elements, and unblocking of alternative transcription start sites and cryptic promoters.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer due to imbalance of certain molecules expression, e.g., IGF2 in Wilm's tumor.</p>
<p>Regarding this example, the imprint control region on the paternal allele is methylated; therefore, the enhancers will act on IGF2 gene, expressing this factor. But on the maternal allele, imprint region is not methylated, so CTCF binds it, allowing that enhancers act on H19 gene, thus repressing IGF2 gene.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm's tumor, there is a double expression of IFG2 gene, because maternal imprint control region is also methylated. IGF2 encodes a fetal peptide hormone that regulates cellular proliferation and differentiation, and its overexpression promotes tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) class, which hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting the enzyme DNA methyltransferase. This drug is analogue of cytidine nucleoside; therefore, the cells incorporate it in DNA during replication, inhibiting methyltransferases and, consequently, causing demethylation.</p>
<p>In cancer, there are hypermethylated regions (CpG islands) that repress tumor suppressor genes. Decitabine induce hypomethylation of those regions, expressing those genes, which control cellular differentiation and proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last because epigenetic changes are inheritable through mitosis, propagating the alteration to daughter, granddaughter cells and so on.</p>
<p>There is an increase of researches of epigenetic treatments for cancer; however researches and physicians should take into consideration that there are some periods of development when it's inadvisable to give the drug. Those periods comprise germ cell development and early-gestational that are known as sensitive periods, because that's when epigenetic reprogramming happens.</p>
<p>Therefore, treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable since those drugs may inhibit epigenetic machinery, causing methylation alteration and loss of imprinting.</p></div>
