    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated although there is methylation between genes, in intergenic and repetitive regions. The normal methylation at CpG islands allows tumor suppressor genes to function. CpG islands are often located in the promoters of tumor suppression genes. CpG islands are hypermethylated in cancer allowing the silencing of tumor suppressors. This disruption creates an enviroment where cells can divide more rapidly and die more slowly, contributing to disease. Cancer is caused by the activation of oncogenes and the inactivation of tumor suppressors.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to allow for the proper functioning of the tumor suppressor genes. In cancer, DNA methylation in intergenic reigions is disrupted by silencing the tumor suppressor gene. This is achieved by locking in acyl in the active state. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, this is a very effective mechanism to “lock down” or silence the tumor suppressor genes. As CpG islands are increasingly methylated, the intergenic regions and repetitive regtions become hypomethylated. The resulting epimutations are rapidly selected, and due to the fact that they are mitotically-heritable,  the resultant cells can quickly outcompete the surrounding “normal” cells. Age is a known variable that impacts the increased methylation of CpG islands, increasing the likelihood that many in the population will develop cancer over time.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the igf2 is methylated. The enhancers can, therefore, allow for the expression of igf2. In the maternal allele, the ifg2 is unmethylated.  CTCF acts as an insulator. The enhancers work on the H19 gene. The result is that igf2 is not expressed.  Wilms' tumor results when there is a lack of imprinting on the maternal allele, resulting in overexpression of igf2, basically a double-dose. The lack of imprinting is the result of hypermethylation in the ICR (Imprint Control Region). Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene. This “double-dose” of this growth-promoting gene results in Wilms' tumor, a tumor of the kidney.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs referred to as  "DNA-demethylating agents." It was discovered that some lymphomas are the result of mutations that make EZH2 overactive. This overactivity methylates histones more than they should be and silences the genes that surround the histones, including tumor-suppressor genes. Researchers found that they could treat the lymphoma cells with an inhibitor that dramatically reduced the amount of histone overmethylation. DNA-demethylating agents such as Decitabine are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia and a rare illness called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. These are the first epigenetic drugs that have been used successfully against a solid tumor.Even those who did not demonstrate a good initial response went on to show an unexpectedly good reaction to routine chemotherapeutic drugs. It is speculated that these durgs alter the tumor cells making them more susceptible to chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr. Baylin's claim is possible. "Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example) epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, they do not return." So these drugs have the potential to leave enduring effects on the epiginome. The "sensitive period" refers to the time of our development where we are undergoing active remodeling of the epigenome when there is both the removal and laying down of epigenetic marks. There are two particularly senitive periods: 1) the period of primordial germ cell development through the production of mature eggs and sperm, and 2) during pre and post implantation of the blastocyst/early embryo. There are brief windows when particular organs may have a sensitive time period, but not as sensitive as earlier stages of development. When we are in the somatic maintenance period (for the majority of our lives), we are in a period of less sensitivity.  Epigentetic drugs are most appropriate when administered to an older patient where there is less concern for long-term consequences. Because changes can be mitotically inherited, it is not advisable to treat younger patients.</p>
