    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">Describe the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.</span></li>
</ul><p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In normal cells, DNA hypomethylations are frequently observed at CpG islands (CGIs). Hypomethylation at CpG-rich promoters allow ease of access to transcription factors, enhancers, DNA polymerase binding which activate gene expressions.</span></p>
<ul><li>Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.</li>
</ul><div>In human cancer cells, epimutations in which hypermethylation of CpG islands associated with the promoter regions of tumor suppresor genes suppress gene expressions.  The inactivation of tumour suppressor gene expression is one of the major factors leading to uncontrolled growh in cancer cells.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<ul><li>Explain how disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease.</li>
</ul><div><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Changes or disruption in methylation patterns at CpG island can suppress expression of tumor-suppressor,  disrupt program-cell death, activation of oncogenes, loss of imprinting contribute to disease in human. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"><br /></span></div>
</div>
<ul><li>Describe the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</li>
</ul><div>In normal cells,  hypermethylations are observed at intergenic regions, repetitive elements and introns.  It's believed that DNA hypermethylation  suppresses repeat activity, prevents transposition of chromosomal recombinations, and stabilizes genomic integenic regions.</div>
<div> </div>
<ul><li>Describe how DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.</li>
</ul><div>In cancer cells, the DNA methylation patterns are reversed to those of normal cells.  Specifically, hypomethylations are likely observed genome-wide specifically at internic regions and at repetitive elements, introns.</div>
<div> </div>
<ul><li>Explain how disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease.</li>
</ul><p>Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions can cause genomic instability. Hypomethylation can activate repeats, create illegimate transpositions during chromosomal recombination, activate cryptic promoters that disrupt neighbor genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status. <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> </span></li>
</ul><div>At Ifg2/H19 cluster imprinting control regions (ICRs), the paternal allele at H19 is 'methylated' preventing CTCF insulator bindng to ICR that  leads to the enhancers to act on Ifg2 gene expression from the paternal allele.</div>
<div> </div>
<ul><li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status.  </li>
</ul><div>At Ifg2/H19 cluster imprinting control regions (ICRs), the maternal allele at H19 is 'unmethylated' allowing CTCF insulator binding to ICR that  prevents enhancers to act to Ifg2 gene expression from the maternal allele.</div>
<div> </div>
<ul><li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.  </li>
</ul><div>In Wilm's tumour, we observed hypermethylation at H19/igf2 ICR.  Besides methylated patenal allele, maternal allele is also methylated as well.</div>
<div> </div>
<ul><li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease.</li>
</ul><p><span style="font-size:14px;">In Wilm's tumour, hypermetylation disrupt imprinting by methlating maternal allele at H19 locus blocking the CTCF insulator binding and cause expression of igf2 genes.  The cell now produces double dosage of igf2 growth factor which subsequently contribute to tumorgenesis. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.  </li>
</ul><div>Decitabine or <strong>5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</strong> is an DNA-demethylating agent (or DNA-hypomethylating agent).</div>
<div> </div>
<ul><li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation. </li>
</ul><div>Decitabine can be incorporated into DNA strand and inhibits DNA methyltransferase activity, limiting DNA methylation process leading to hypometylation at  [1].</div>
<div> </div>
<ul><li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.  </li>
</ul><p>Decitabine can have anti-tumour effect in certain type of tumours by reversing hypermethylation occurred at CGIs of the tumour suppressor genes.  In particular, Decitabine is being used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes [2].</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome</li>
</ul><p><span style="font-size:14px;">Alterations of DNA methylation or changes in epigentic epigenetic marks are preserved mitotically through celluar divisions.  Subsequent cell lines carry predecessors epigenetic marks. Thus, DNA methylation could have long lasting effects in epigenome.</span></p>
<ul><li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period. </li>
</ul><div>Sensitive periods are period in which genetic or enviromental impacts on imprinting process that could have severe or long lasting effects.</div>
<div> </div>
<ul><li>Identify sensitive periods of development. </li>
</ul><div>In human development,  during fertilized egg pre-implantation early development and primordial germ cells development are considered sensitive periods where massive epigenetic reprogramming occur.</div>
<div> </div>
<ul><li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable. </li>
</ul><p>Treament during sensitive periods during massive epigenetic reprogramming may cause unintended long lasting epigenetic effects; thus it's inadvisible to treat patients during sensitive periods.</p></div>
