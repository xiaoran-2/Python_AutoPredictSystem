    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally DNA methylation is found on CpG sites throughout the genome and is associated with gene silencing. CpG islands are areas with an unusually large amount of CpG sites clustered and are normally unmethylated. In cancer CpG islands become hypermethylated and CpG sites throughout the genome become hypomethylated. CpG island hypermethylation often leads to silencing of tumour suppressor genes thus contributing to cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated silencing these genes and stabilizing the genome. However, in cancer these regions are hypomethylated, decreasing genomic stability and leading to illegitimate recombination between repeats, transposition, and disruption of normal gene expression thereby increasing tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At the H19/Igf2 paternal allele H19 is methylated blocking the enhancers from interacting with the H19 promoter instead leading to enhancement and expression of Igf2. At the maternal allele H19 is unmethylated so the enhancers act to increase H19 expression and Igf2 is not expressed. In Wilm's tumour the maternal allele becomes hypermethylated leading to a loss of H19 expression but more importantly an expression of the maternal Igf2 gene, doubling the tumour cell Igf2 expression. Since Igf2 is a cell growth promoter this increases the growth potential of the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that becomes incorporated into the DNA upon cell division. When the DNMT tries to methylate decitabine it becomes irreversibly bound to the DNA so that it cannot methylate other sites in the genome. It therefore decreases DNA methylation of dividing cells and since cancer cells divide more rapidly than other cells in the body these effects are concentrated in the tumour tissue. Lack of methylation in these cells causes cell death therefore having an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is conserved through normal somatic cell division by DNA methyltransferases which copy the methylation marks on the parent DNA strand onto the daughter DNA strands. Altering DNA methylation can change the DNA methylation patterns and since methylation patterns are conserved by dividing cells this altered methylation will be transferred to the daughter cells leading to a loss of the original methylation pattern.</p>
<p>During sensitive periods (periods of epigenetic reprogramming) DNA methylation is erased and new methylation patterns are established. These periods occur immediately following conception and during gametogenesis.</p>
<p>Treatment with drugs altering DNA methylation during these sensitive periods is especially dangerous as these periods lay an epigenetic foundation for the development of their offspring, either by directly altering conceptus methylation patterns or altering the potential conceptus through changes in germ cell methylation.</p></div>
