    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA METHYLATION IS ALTERED IN CANCER: the modification of the C5 position of the cytosine base (5 mC) is found in approximately 70-80% of Cpg dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells and to some extend in non-CPG sequences in embryonic stem cells. DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. Exceptions are CPG island, which are found in about 60% of promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. </p>
<p>The epigenome of cancer cells displays numerous alterations in comparison to the epigenome of their normal counterpart. Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprented genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes- controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair - by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands. Interestingly, no global hypomethylation but rather a directed hypomethylation at satellite repeats could be detected in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors using a genome- wide approach.  Numerous changes in modifiction patterns have also been observed at the level of posttranslational histone modifications. the los  of repressive heterochromatin is reflected by a depletion of repressive histone marks such as H4K20me3 and H4k16ac in these regions. Further, H3k27me3 seems to occur mutually exclusive to DNA methylation and promote de novo silencing of genes in different cancers. Many developmental genes that are silenced by H3k27me3 in embryonic stem cell are silenced by DNA methylation in cancer cells, establishing an epigenetic switch from a dynamic to a more stable silencing system that promotes a stem cell.like signature of cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation Pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines igf2 expression status: the genomic impinting is a genetic phenomenon by wich certain genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. It is an inheritance process independent of the classical mendelian inheritance. Imprinted alleles are silenced such that the genes are either expressed only from the non-imprinted allele inherited from the mother H19 or CDKN1C or in other instances from the non-imprented allele inherited from the father IGF-2, from of genomic imprinting have been demonstrate in insects, mammals and flowering plants. Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process that involves DNA methylation and histone methylation in order to achieve monoallelic gene expression without altering the genetic sequence. Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process in wich the activity of gene is determined by its parent of origin. mechanisms governing genomic imprinting are just beginning to be understood. however, the tendency of imprinted genes to exist in chromosomal clusters suggests a sharing of regulatory elements. To better understand imprinted gene clustering, we disrupted a cluster of imprinted genes on mouse distal chromosome 7 using the cre/loxP recombination system. In mice carrying a site-specific translocation separating Cdkn1c and Kcnq1.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Interactions between histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) and decitabine were investigated in models of diffuse large B-cell limphoma (DLBCL). A number of cell lines representing both germinal center B-like and activated B- cell like DLBCL, patient-derived tumor cells and a murine xenograft model were used to study the effects of HDACIs and decitabine in this system. All explored HDACIs in combination with decitabine produced a synergistic effect in grwth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in DLBCL cells. This effect was time dependent, mediated via caspase-3 activation, and resulted in increased levels ao acetylated histones. Synergy in inducing apoptosis was confirmed in patient-derived primary tumor cells treated with panobinostat and decitabine. Xenagrafting experiments confirmed the in vitro activity and tolerability of the xenografting experiments confirmed the in vitro activity and tolerability of the combination. we analyzed the molecular basis for this synergistic effec by evaluating gene-expression and methylation patterns using microarrays, validation by bisulfite sequencing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Among all the epigenetics research conducted so far, the most extensively studied disease is cancer, and the evidence linking epigenetic processes with cancer is becoming extremely compelling.The researchers found times as many differentially expressed genes between a pair of 50 years old twins compared to 3 year old teins, and the 50 year old twin with more DNA hypomethylation and histone hyperacetylation had the higher number of overexpressed genes. The degreee of epigenetic change therefore was directly linked with the degree of change in genetic function. Sometimes the effects of epigenetic mechanisms show up in living color. Changes in the pigmentation of mouse pup fur, ranging from yellow to brown, were directly tied to supplementation of the pregnant mothers diet with vitamin B 12, folic acid, choline and betaine. The color changes were directly linked to alterations in DNA methylation. Substances aren,t the only sources of epigenetic changes. The licking, grooming, and nursing methods that mother rats use with their pups can affect the long-term behavior of their offspring, and those results can be tied to changes in DNA methylation and histone acetylation at a glococorticoid receptor gene promoter in the pup`s hippocampus. Comprehensively studying all the epigenetic and epigenomic factors related to a multitude of diseases and health conditions will take much more work.</p></div>
