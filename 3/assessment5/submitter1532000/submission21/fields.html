    <h1>Submission 21 from Anon (session_user_id: c3d6b1173445f3d9ff0d23f5ff6c0325f4603528)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="float:none;">Decitabine is classiffied demethylating and antimetabolite agent. It is a cytosine analogue modified in the position 5 of the pyrimidine ring. </span></li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="float:none;">Decitabine is a demethylating agent that induce transient DNA hypomethylation in the promoter regions of genes rich CPG island, by mechanism in w/c the DNA - nucleoside analoque complex binds to inhibit DNMT. </span></li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="float:none;">It inhibits a group of enzyme DNA methyltransferase (DNMTs) thereby causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular diffrentiation or cell death. </span></li>
<li>Decitabine anti-tumor effect is by inhibiting  DNMT resulting in the hypomethylation of the DNA and the re-expression of the tumor suppressor gene ( Leone et al 2002: Das and Signal, 2004) </li>
</ul><div> </div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Modifying DNA methylation have an enduring effects on the epigenome because these changes is mitotically heritable - can be passed on during cell division from daughter cells to grandaughter cells until the acitively erased and once erased they do not have the capacity to returm.  In epigenetic therapies of cancer this means modifying DNA methylation may affect the structure of the chromatin which possibly cause side effects over a long period of time. </li>
<li>Sensitive period  are the  early embryonic development and the primordial germ cell. The reprograming of DNA occurs These  are the sensitive period of epigenetic re-programming. </li>
<li>Treating patients during the sensitive period my disrupt the normal regulatory processes of the cell-cycle. </li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li> DNA methylation at the CPG islands is essential in the development of the normal cell.  It plays an important part in cells-regulatory processes that govern gene transcription, in the mechanism of X-chromosome inactivation,in the maintance of imprinted genes and it determines the cell-type-specific expression patterns of genes in some cases. </li>
<li>In abnormal cell growth like Cancer the DNA methylation at the CPG islands is prone for hypermethylation thereby causes the underlying gene to be silenced. </li>
<li>It silences the tumor suppressor gene by hypermethylating their promoter CPG island causing problem in controlling cell-cycle, DNA repair, and programmed cell death. </li>
<li>Recent studies have hypothesized that DNA mehtylation  in the intergenic and repetitive elements possibly control transcriptional noise from alternative start sites,inhibits antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing.  </li>
<li>In Cancer cells the intergenic region w/c comprises the majority of a cell-methyl content exhibit hypomethylation thereby making the transposable elements to become active contributing to the genomic instability. </li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The expression of H19 and Igf2 genes are imprinted. Even though these neighboring genes share enhancer - Igf2 is expressed only in maternally inherited allele and H19 in paternally inherited alelle. </li>
<li>A region of paternal-specific methylation upstream of H19 appears to be site of an epigenetic mark that is required for the imprinting of these genes. Deletion within this region results in loss of imprinting of both H19/Igf2. </li>
<li>In the maternal allele there is an upstream (left) promoter that is unmethylated and active. Binding of transcriptions to this upstream promoters enables of the sense strands of the gene to produce Igf2r mRNA. There is also a downstream set of CpG Islands that are methylated. Source: Internet Nature: (Oct 16, 1997) Wutz et. al </li>
<li> Studies have indicated that in Wilm's tumor there is a loss of imprinting in the maternal chromosome and methylation is shipted to the paternal patttern of methylation. In Wilms tumor H19 is inactivated (reduced expression) resulting to the overexpression of IGF2. Since H19 slows cell growth and IGF2 promotes cell growth, loss of imprinting at these locus results to uncontrolled cell growt leading to tumor formation. </li>
