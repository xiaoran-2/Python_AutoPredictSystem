    <h1>Submission 1881 from Anon (session_user_id: e2b611538f4464cd9c1cb3cc645064862b1d7deb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, therefore, it will cause hypomethylation. Since cancer cells have the distinct feature of being able to divide and proliferate rapidly, it can be assumed that the genes that encode proteins that control proliferation should be silenced in cancer cells by DNA methylation. Therefore, if we can inhibit DNA methytransferases by this drug, we can reactivate genes that control cell division and stop the uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells. This drug is proved to show no effect on normal cells since they do not proliferate as rapidly as cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have long lasting effects on epigenome because epigenetic changes are inheritable which means that same epigenetic pattern can be seen in daughter cells after cell division. Sensitive periods are when epigenetic reprogramming takes place during development. They are called sensitive periods because cells show<span class="st"> more sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic changes.</span> Passage from fertilized egg to blastocyst, gastrulation, generation of primordial germ cells and gamettes are the sensitive period in which epigenetic reprogramming takes place. I wouldn't be advisable to use epigenetic drugs for long lasting effects beyond drug treatment since there is a dynamic process going on during these periods. We want our epigenetic change to be inheritable in this case, but epigenetic reprogramming would not allow this to occur since the marks will disappear or reappear during these periods.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, there is DNA methylation at ICR which will prevent CTCF(insulator which insulates the access of enhancers to Igf2 gene) to bind and thereby DNA methylation will spread through H19 promoter and cause its silencing whereas enhancer will be able to activate Igf2 gene. On the maternal allele there is no DNA methylation at ICR thereby enhancer will act on H19 but the CTCF will insulate the activation of Igf2. In Wilm's tumour, there is DNA hypermethylation on ICR and thereby Igf2 will be active on both allese and imprinting will be disrupted. Igf2 which promotes growth will contribute to uncontrolled proliferation of Wilm's tumour cells. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, DNA methylation at CpG islands results in silencing of a gene. In cancer cells CpG islands become more hypermethylated as they become more invasive. As hypermethylation increases, more and more genes will become silenced. Those genes will contain tumour suppressor genes which normally regulated cell growth and proliferation. In normal cells, DNA methylation in intergenic regions is to maintain genomic stability by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. If there is hypomethylation in those regions, then these cryptic sites will be active and they will cause abnormalities such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations which will cause genomic instability. In these deleted regions for example there may be tumour suppressor genes, adversely, insertions may cause overexpression of oncogenes. Genes that encode for repair enzymes could be disrupted and it will cause DNA damage accumulation which will also contribute to cancer development. As for DNA methylation in repetitive elements, again in normal cells, they are methylated so that genomic stability is maintained by inactivating these elements so that we can stop transpositions, to prevent stronger promoters from interfering transcription of other genes and to hinder recombination events which may cause problems. Also, since methylated Cytosine is converted to thymine rapidly, this can hinder transposition, too.  These events will eventually cause the same problems which are seen in DNA hypomethylation of intergenic regions in cancer cells, since repeats are also hypomethylated in cancer cells. </p></div>
