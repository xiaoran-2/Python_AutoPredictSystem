    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpG islands are regions lacking of methylation that have a higher G+C content than the genome average. When cancer begins, the tumor supressor genes that are present at CpG islands are no longer produced. <span>Disrupting any of the systems that contribute to epigenetic alterations can cause abnormal activation or silencing of genes. D<span>NA methylation in non-promoter intergenic regions and gene bodies promotes gene expression by functionally antagonizing Polycomb repression. When a change in the gene system in intergenic regions occurs, this means there is a presence of cancer. The genes can no longer develop regularly and are now considered a tumor. <span>DNA methylation contains a silent chromatin state by collaborating with other proteins that adjust nucleosomes. </span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Genomic imprinting is a </span><span>process that involves DNA methylation </span><span>in order to achieve </span><span>gene expression without altering the genetic sequence. These epigenetic marks are established </span><span>and can be maintained through mitotic divisions. Both the paternal and materal alleles are involved this is process. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is chemotherapy drug used in treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Decitabine is classified as an "antimetabolite" and a "demethylation" agent. Decitabine belongs to the HDAC class of inhibitors. The Decitabine helps the DNA methylation produce the anti-tumor genes it was producing before the cancer took over. The anti-tumor effect deteriorates the tumor in the body. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA could start to pick up on the use of drug. The body could notice that it is helping and could adpot the code needed to help keep the cancer away. The sensitive period a person goes through could affect the effect of their treatment. It is best that treatment does not take place during this time because patients are more prone to shock. </p></div>
