    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>islands are regions of the genome that is rich with cytosine and guanine, usually marking genes, or more accuratelly, places with high transcription rate. Because of this high transcription rate hey are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. Healthy cells can usually be distinguished from cancer cells promoter because CpG islands in cancer cells tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. Overall, this genome-wide loss and regional gain of DNA methylation causes genomic instability, as well as the silencing of tumor supressing genes.<br />Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA. It has been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and also relates to replication timing, so cancer can disrupt those elements of healthy cell production- it has been shown that a directed hypomethylation (but no global hypomethylation) at satellite repeats could be detected in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors using a genome-wide approach.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. The anti-tumour effect is based on demethylation of DNA, so epigenetic changes that are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells are actively erased. Once they are erased, they do not return which is most welcome because by using epigenetic therapies, changes can be made which stop division and growth of cancer cells without killing its, as well as the neighbouring, healthy cells.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Unlike transcription and translation changes, as well as mutations in some cases, epignetic changes are permanent: epigenetic changes are passed to future genrations of cells, daughter and granddaughter cells and so on, until they are actively erased by special mechanism, after wich they do not sponatneously return. That may be the reason why some cells can be more susceptible to standard chemotherapy: treated cells are different, they epigenetic marks are different in coparison with normal, epigeneticly unchanged cells, making it more challenging to treat with standard treatments, eg. chemotherapy.</p></div>
