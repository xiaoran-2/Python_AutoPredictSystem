    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer the DNA methylation of CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are disrupted. Therefore studying these regions and comparing the role of methylation in DNA between normal and cancer cells can be used in diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>The normal role of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression, and there is little methylation at this location in normal cells. However, CpG islands are characteristically hypermethylated in cancer cells. This hypermethylation can either be at single genes or for sets of genes, as seen in CIMP. Increased methylation of CpG islands leads to silencing of tumour suppressor genes, thereby removing barriers to cancer cell growth.</p>
<p>However, cancer cell growth is also related to the abnormal DNA methylation across the genome seen in cancer cells. In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to silence gene expression and therefore maintain genomic integrity. In cancer cells, and particularly for repeats, these regions are hypomethylated, leading to the expression of these regions. This expression can lead to increased deletions and insertions of genes and illegitimate recombination between parts of genes. The lack of methylation at these regions means that DNA is not densely packed into heterochromatin and is more available to be expressed. Overall, the over-expression of these regions leads to increased genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19 / Igf2 cluster is an example of how the methylation of an imprint control region (ICR) can contribute to cancer. In a normal cell, the paternal allele exhibits a methylated ICR, which prevents the binding of the CTCF protein. The methylation of the ICR spreads to the H19 promoter and acts to silence this CpG island promoter. Downstream enhancers can then directly act on Igf2 and increase the expression of this growth factor. Thus the H19 / Igf2 cluster has a growth promoting role on the paternal allele. Alternatively, on the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and this allows the CTCF protein to bind to this region. This binding prevents the enhancers from activating Igf2, and instead they act on the H19 promoter directly. Given the inactivated growth factor, the maternal allele role is therefore in growth silencing.  In Wilm’s tumour, the ICR on both the maternal and paternal allele are methylated, thus CTCF is unable to bind on either allele. Both alleles therefore exhibit Igf2 expression and act as growth promoting genes. The overexpression of Igf2 therefore leads to cancer cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the epigenetic inhibitor class of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT’s). The role of DNMT is to copy the methylation pattern of parent cells into subsequent daughter cells during replication. In cancer cells, the hypermethylation of CpG islands leads to the inactivation of tumour suppressor genes, thus DNMT binding leads to continued hypermethylation at these sites for subsequent cells and tumour suppression genes continue to be inactivated. Decabitine works as a hypomethylating agent in two main ways. It can be incorporated into the DNA and induce hypomethylation at CpG islands, thereby allowing the expression of tumour suppressor genes and limiting tumour growth or metastasis. Alternatively it can bind to DNMT’s to prevent their role in DNA synthesis and thereby stop cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. This means that daughter cells have tissue homogeneity, which is essential for cell identity and function. However, there are two sensitive periods in which epigenetic reprogramming is occurring to restore the totipotency of cells. These sensitive periods are during early development at the zygote and primordial germ cell development. Early development is characterised by demethylation, rapidly occurring on the paternal genome and passively on the maternal genome.  While primordial germ cell development is characterised by DNA methylation, occurring during egg and sperm cell development.</p>
<p>During a sensitive period, it would be inadvisable to treat patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation as it can have far-reaching effects on cell development. Specifically, during sensitive periods repeats tend to maintain their levels of methylation despite epigenetic reprogramming, thus drugs which affect methylation may induce changes in the expression of repeats leading to increased genomic instability. Similarly, genomic imprinting occurs during epigenetic reprogramming and this ensures that only one of the two parental alleles is expressed in cells. This imprinting is essential for embryo survival and thus changing methylation may influence the mortality of embryos.</p></div>
