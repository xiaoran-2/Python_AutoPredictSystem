    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are normally unmethylated  which allows for the expression of genes that we typically think of as good for us. With cancer, we often see the methylation of CpG islands and therefore the lack of expression of those desired genes. This can contribute to disease because a key protein that the gene codes for is no longer being made. The protein could be key in tumor suppression or management of cell growth and division, or any one of a number of key processes. Normally, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated, thus blocking the expression of these sections of DNA. With cancer they are often unmethylated. Repetitive elements can be very bad due to their ability to cause genomic instability. This could be in the form of illegitimate recombination where normally heterochromatinized and methylated repeats can line up across chromosomes and lead to incorrect swapping of parts of chromosomes. It can also be in the form of simple activation of repeats whereby they copy themselves and transpose throughout the genome. (In essence leading to deletions or insertions.) Finally it could lead to the expression of cryptic promoters that lead to the expression of undesired genes.  Both genetic instability and the expression of genes by cryptic promoters can lead to odd behavior in cells and could ultimately lead to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can lead to cancer. In the normal case of the H19/Igf2 cluster the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated, which allows enhancers to act on the Igf2 gene and leads to its expression.  The typical maternal allele ICR is unmethylated, which allows for the CTCF to bind and then block the enhancers from reaching the Igf2 gene. Instead the enhancer acts on the H19 gene. With Wilm’s tumor, the maternal allele is methylated just like to paternal allele, leading to a double dose of Igf2 and no doses of H19. The Igf2 gene is a growth enhancer.This leads to unregulated growth and a tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, which means it removes methylation. If it helps to remove methylation then genes which might have previously been methylated that play a role in regulation cell growth and division, (i.e. tumor suppresors), could then be active and hopefully slow-down or stop the cancer from growing and spreading.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can last beyond the period of drug treatment because methylation is mitotically heritable. DNA methyltransferase or DNMT1 actively identifies half methylated base pairs in DNA and methylates the other half.  This insures the changes remain beyond the period of drug treatment. An epigenetically sensitive period is one in which there is active re-programming of the epigenetic marks. Such periods include early development of the embryo from fertilization to the blastocyst, and the development of primordial germ cells. It would be unwise to administer treatments that encourage or discourage methylation during these sensitive periods. If a mother received treatments during the early development of her baby then the correct epigenetic marks might not be laid down for the baby’s somatic cells. If these treatments were administered during primordial germ cell development than the germ cells might not properly reprogram and be free of most somatic marks, and/or it might interfere with the imprinting of specific genes.</p></div>
