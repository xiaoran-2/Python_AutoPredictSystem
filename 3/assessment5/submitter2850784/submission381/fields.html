    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation controls many essential functions in the genome for the normal development, such as: gene recombination, replication control, control of DNA parasites that invade the human genome, and stabilization of gene expression, regulation of cell differentiation and X chromosome inactivation. Typically, CpG islands are not methylated. However, there is a different situation in cancer. Errors during DNA replication, errors in pairing or exposition to carcinogenic agents can lead to changes that can be recognized by methyltransferases. These enzymes are responsible to the hypermethylation of regions such as CpG islands, causing silencing of tumor suppressor genes and repair genes. On the other hand, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, under normal conditions, are generally hypomethylated, collaborating with chromosomal stability. But in cancer we have high hypomethylation of these repetitive elements or the intergenic regions, increasing the chromosomal instability and allowing translocations to occur. This can disrupt conding regions of genes. Furthermore, activation of oncogenes can also occur. Both hypermethylation of CpG islands and hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements can lead to more mutations and uncontrolled cell growth, which are remarkable features in cancer.<br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-62b424570dd5bd9a05508f14/970238/asst-5/970238-52070173954fd4.37633412.pdf">WRITING ASSIGNMENT Q1.pdf</a></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster works in this fashion: H19 acts suppressing tumors, and Igf2 promotes the fetal growth. The paternal allele of this cluster is hypermethylated, promoting the expression of Igf2 and suppressing H19. On the other hand, the maternal allele is hypomethylated, suppressing Igf2 and promoting H19. Both genes present monoallelic expression. In this normal condition, the fetus can grow normally. But in tumors with loss of imprinting, the maternal chromosome looks like the paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter. Then, Igf2 turned on, and H19 turned off. The activation of growth factor and the silencing of suppressor gene cause increased cell growth. Loss of imprinting of IGF2 is linked to reduced expression and abnormal methylation of H19 in Wilms' tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-62b424570dd5bd9a05508f14/970238/asst-5/970238-520708013762b9.91280538.pdf">WRITING ASSIGNMENT Q3.pdf</a><br />Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methytransferase. This drug can be incorporated into DNA strands, avoiding the action of methyltransferases, that add methyl groups in the DNA. So, as the DNA replication and cell division occur, the new strands in the daughter cells are becoming free of methylation. This may up-regulate factors required for chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-62b424570dd5bd9a05508f14/970238/asst-5/970238-520708149d00a8.76712307.pdf">WRITING ASSIGNMENT Q4.pdf</a><br />Drugs that alter DNA methylation can incorporate into the DNA upon replication, and then, when the DNA methyltransferase, for instance, tries to bind the nucleotide, the drug binds first. <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can’t be released anymore. Then, that enzyme copy the methylation to the daughter strand. </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Therefore, as the action of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent and cancer cells divide much more rapidly than the normal cells, these cancer cells will be more severely affected and this epigenetic mark, the methylation, will not be maintained. </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development are the sensitive periods. In these periods, the epigenetics of the genome is being reprogrammed. </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">If we treat pregnant patients during sensitive periods, the fetus can be suffer abnormal epigenetic reprogramming; If we treat patients (in this case men are included) during the germ cell development, abnormal epigenetic reprogramming can occur in the germ cells.</span></p></div>
