    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are normally hypomethylated and tumor suppressor genes are expressed.  In cancer the CpG islands become hypermethylated. This leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes.  Normally there is relative DNA hypermethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  In cancer, this hypermethylation is lost leading to expression of these genes and repetitive elements, the appearance of transcriptional noise fom alternative start sites that are no longer repressed, and appearance of antisense transcription.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can result in the loss of expression of growth restraining genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes.  In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal H19 is methylated and therefore not expressed and Igf2, which is growth promoting, is expressed, in the maternal allele H19 is not methylated and Igf2 is not expressed.  In Wilm's tumor, because of hypermethylation, the maternal H19 allele also becomes methylated which leads to expression of the maternal Igf2 growth promoting gene.  You now have an abnormal situation with both the maternal and paternal Igf2 growth promoting gene being expressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methylation. DNA methyltransferase is inhibited, and in cells that are actively dividing, this leads to new cells without the DNA being methylated, becoming in effect, demethylated.  By demethylating CpG islands this way, tumor suppressors are again expressed leading to an antitumor effect.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of the drug treatment. They can have downstream effects if methylation is increased the action of DNA methyltransferases will continue the process.  Sensitive periods are during germ cell development, primordial and and early embryonic development when the environment is able to influence the epigenetic makeup during active remodeling of the epigenome.  Patients being treated during germ cell development will have the epigenome altered and it may set them and their progeny up for future malignancies by taking an epigenetic hit, as well have teratogenic effects.</p></div>
