    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are mainly found in promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes.  In normal cells CpG islands are not methylated allowing therefore gene expression.</p>
<p>However, in cancerous cells they frequently become hypermethylated leading to epigenetic silencing of genes, thus enhancing oncogenesis.</p>
<p>Tumor suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than genetic mutation and considered one of the hits in Knudson hypothesis.  The facts that this locus-specific DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and epimutations are rapidly selected for leads to proliferation of tumour cells and eventuate cancer.</p>
<p>The sets of hypermetylated CpG island differ by tumour type and the methylation increases as the cancer progresses over time. However, this same sort of DNA methylation also occurs as people normally age, accumulating epigenetic mistakes that could lead to some kind of tumour.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In general the intergenic region and the repetitive elements in normal cells are methylated leading to heterochromatin.</p>
<p>Whereas in cancerous cells these regions become hypomethylated (not methylated). Genome wide hypomethylation that is common in all cancerous cells is the earliest epigenetic abnormality found and progresses with time. Hypomethylated repeats lead to genomic instability. They allow illegitimate recombination between non-identical chromosomes with recombination between repetitive elements. It is possible since the chromosome is not tightly packed (euchromatin) due to the lack of methylation. Further, repeats can be activated due to hypomethylation allowing to copy and transpose themselves causing new mutation in genes or unwanted gene activation through influencing promoters. In summary, hypomethylation of repeats leads to genomic instability through deletion, insertion or reciprocal translocation of chromosomes.</p>
<p>The less frequent, hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can lead to gene activation, such as <em>R-RAS </em>in gastric cancer.</p>
<p>Role of DNA methylation (hyper/hypo) is context dependent either suppressing of enhancing tumourgenesis depending on the type or lifespan of the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is the monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression of genes. Common feature of cancer cells is the loss of imprinting. They become either expressed or silenced from both parental alleles.</p>
<p>In case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, which is paternally imprinted, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the parental allele and un-methylated on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In un-methylated (maternal) state the ICR is bound by the CTCF insulator element thus blocking the action of enhancers and silencing the Igf2 gene, however enhancing H19 expression.</p>
<p>In contrast, when ICR is methylated (paternal) no insulator can bind and the enhancers act on Igf2 to express.</p>
<p>In case of Wilm’s tumor, the imprinting is lost, so both alleles are methylated. Methylation of the ICRs leads to expression of both Igf2 genes. Double dose of the growth promoting Igf2 causes this specific childhood kidney tumour.</p>
<p>Contribution to disease. Disruption of imprinting changes the methylation status of the maternal allele at the H19/Igf2 cluster. It leads to overexpression of growth promoting genes and loss of expression of growth restricting genes, eventuating in oncogenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA metyltransferases inhibitor. It is an FDA approved drug for treating myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia.</p>
<p>Dectabine gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication. When the DNA methyl- transferase comes along the integrated drug binds the transferase irreversibly. Therefore, no copy of the methylation can be passed on to the DNA daughter strand.</p>
<p>These inhibitors are replication dependent. Since cancer cells are dividing much more rapidly than other body cells they are more affected. Mechanism of action is not yet fully known. However, they have been most effective against haematological cancers, where CpG islands are highly methylated causing tumour suppressor gene silencing. With the drug, silencing would not occur thus expression of tumour suppressor genes would be enhanced and herewith reduction in the tumour achieved.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable therefore any alteration is passed on to the next generation of cells.  Epigenetic changes are passed on from cell division to cell division until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sensitive period is referring to the times when epigenetic reprograming occurs during development.  The removal and laying done of epigenetics marks in the genome. Cells are most sensitive to environmental changes at these times.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These sensitive periods are the early development during fertilization (pre-implantation and early post implantation period) and the primordial germ cell development. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Treatment of patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods are dangerous since any alteration of epigenetic marks would affect a wide range of cells and tissue not just tumour cells. Further, due to the transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through the gametes any alteration would be passed on to the next generation through the epigenetically altered germ cells.  It is yet unclear what proportion of epigenetic changes are meiotically or mitotically heritable.</p></div>
