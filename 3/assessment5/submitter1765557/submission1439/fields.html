    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG islands are generally unmethylated on DNA. If the CpG islands are not DNA methylated, gene can be expressed. Otherwise, intergenic and intronic region and repetitive element are hypermethylated on DNA. Thanks to DNA methylation, repetitive element are stabilized in a normal cell. Indeed, hypermethylation of repetitive element prevents the transposition of transposons and leads to genomic stability. Moreover, DNA hypermethylation of intronic or intergenic regions prevents cryptic promoters from being expressed.<br />On the other hand, in cancer cells, DNA methylation of CpG island is enhanced. There is a problem with CpG island of tumour suppressor genes because DNA methylation of CpG island silences these genes (for example : RB in retinoblastoma) and can lead to proliferation and apoptosis resistance of tumour cells (as mutations can do). Indeed, in cancer cells, genes which promoter regions are in the CpG islands can be silenced because CpG island are hypermethylated. Tumour suppressor genes can be inactivated by this mechanism (like other genetic alterations : deletion, mutation...) and can be one hit of the knudson hypothesis. Moreover, DNA methylation can be transmitted to the daughter cells because it is mitotically heritable. In colon cancer, CpG island hypermethylation is paradoxally associated with a good prognosis in old women. Otherwise, intergenic region and repetitive element are hypomethylated in cancer and can lead to genomic instability. Indeed, the hypomethylation of repetitive element leads to activation of the repeats and transposition. Neighbouring genes can be disturbed  by activation of cryptic promoters if intergenic (or intronic) regions are hypomethylated. Furthermore, abnormal recombinaisons between repeats can occur by hypomethylation of these repeats. So abnormal karyotype can be observed in tumours (deletions, insertions and/or translocations are frequent). Finally, the hypomethylation of "CpG poor promoters" can lead to oncogene activation in cancer cells (R-RAS in gastric cancer).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation can lead to cancer. Indeed, hypo or hypermethylation of the Imprinting Control Region (ICR) can result in overexpression of oncogenes or loss of expression of tumour suppressor genes.</p>
<p>For example, in normal cells, the H19/Igf2 cluster is an imprinted region.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated (so does the H19 promoter). So, the distal enhancers normally promote the Igf2 expression. However, H19 gene is not expressed by the paternal allele. <br />On the other hand, on the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and the CTCF can bind the ICR and prevents the enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promoter. So the enhancers promote H19 expression. Igf2 is not expressed.<br />In Wilm's tumour, on the maternal allele, ICR is abnormally unmethylated (like the paternal allele) corresponding to a loss of maternal imprinting. So, in the tumour, H19 is both silenced on the two alleles. Worse, Igf2 is both expressed on maternal and paternal alleles. The double dosage of Igf2 is a key factor of the Wilm's tumour because Igf2 promotes cell growth and proliferation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a new anticancer drug. Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) Inhibitors. So, decitabine inhibits the DNMT and it is a hypomethylating agent. Indeed, DNMT3 methylates hemimethylated DNA and it is responsible for DNA methylation maintenance. If you inhibit DNMT3 by decitabine, you will inhibit DNA methylation maintenance. DNA will be hypomethylated. More cell will divide, more DNA will be hypomethylated. It's used in hematological malignancies like myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemias. Its mechanism of action is still unclear but decitabine likely decreases the CpG islands methylation of tumour suppressor genes. In this case, tumour suppressor of genes could be expressed again and the cell growth and proliferation could decrease. This drug doesn't kill every tumour cells but it can stop the tumour proliferation. The association of decitabine with another anticancer drug (which kills the tumour cells) could be very succesful.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If you have inhibited DNMT3 by decitabine, you could inhibit DNA methylation maintenance. And, if you have inhibited DNMT1 by decitabine, you could have prevented DNA methylation. So, DNA is hypomethylated. And, DNA methylation is mitotically heritable : if you have a hypomethylated mother cell, the two daughter cells will be hypomethylated.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming (epigenetic marks are cleared and reseted). We can identify two sensitive periods, during the early development of the foetus and during the "primordial germ cells" development. An epigenetic drug can prevent cells from being epigenetically reprogrammed. So, the epigenetic drugs mustn't be prescribed neither to pregnant women nor women and men of childbearing age. Every time, there is a risk for the unborn child (loss of imprinting, problem in X inactivation for the baby girl, ....). If you treat a pregnant woman, the baby could have abnormalities of epignetic marks or transmit abnormalities of epignetic marks to his children. If you treat young patients who will have children, there is a risk to have an abnormal epigenome of germ cells and abnormal babies. These drugs are fortunately prescribed as anticancer drug in MDS (older patients). </p></div>
