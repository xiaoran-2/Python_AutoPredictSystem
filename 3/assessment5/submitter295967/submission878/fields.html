    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="western">Normally, the imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/ Igf2 cluster of genes is paternally imprinted, meaning that it is methylated on the paternal allele. As a result, CTCP, an insulator protein, does not bind on the paternal allele, and enhancers downstream of Igf2 act on Igf2 to enhance Igf2 expression from the paternal allele.</p>
<p class="western">Normally, the ICR of the H19/ Igf2 cluster is unmethylated on the maternal allele. As a result of this lack of methylation, CTCP binds on the maternal allele. This binding insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. Therefore, Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele.</p>
<p class="western">Wilm's tumor is caused by disruption to imprinting at the H19/ Igf2 cluster, such that the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele. <span style="color:#000000;">This disruption could be due to mutations or deletions that result in loss of imprinting, or paternal uniparental disomy. In rare cases, it could result from epigenetic disruption. </span>The upregulation of Igf2 expression results in Wilm's tumor, a childhood kidney tumor.</p>
<p class="western">As Igf2 is an oncogene, disrupted imprinting at the H19/ Igf2 cluster leads to fetal and post-natal overgrowth. It also increases the risk of embryonic and childhood tumors.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="western">Some drugs may lead to <em>de novo</em> DNA methylation. After cell division, the parent strand of the DNA maintains the methyl group while the daughter strand is unmethylated. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is recruited by such hemi-methylated DNA, and lays down methylation in the daughter strand. The DNA is now fully methylated. Other drugs may lead to DNA demethylation. Neither the parent nor daughter strand of DNA has a methyl group and this state can persist through continued cell division. In both cases, the altered DNA methylation endures.</p>
<p class="western">A sensitive period is a period in which the occurrence or absence of certain events has long-term consequences for an organism. Periods of massive epigenetic reprogramming are sensitive periods of development. Early development in the pre-implantation embryo and primordial germ cell development in the mid-gestational embryo are sensitive periods. The ages of 9 to 12 in males and 8 to 10 as well as fetal and infant life, in females may be sensitive periods during which germ cells are maturing. Treating patients during sensitive periods may disrupt the ongoing epigenetic reprogramming, which may go on to impact the health of not just the patients, but also their progeny.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="western">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. Decitabine behaves as a nucleoside analog. It irreversibly binds DNMTs after it is incorporated into DNA. At low doses, it leads to DNA demethylation. Decitabine is dependent on replication to be effective; cancer cells, which divide more rapidly, are expected to experience more DNA demethylation than normal cells due to the administration of this drug. It probably leads to DNA demethylation in all dividing cells of the patient to some extent.</p>
<p class="western">Decitabine is effective on myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Besides DNA demethylation, it is not certain whether the drug has any other mechanisms of action. It is believed that Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect in MDS because MDS is driven by tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation. Therefore, DNA demethylation reverses this silencing of tumor suppressor genes so that they may activate to exert an anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="western">Normally, CpG islands, which are present in 60% of promoters, are lightly methylated. In cancer, CpG islands of tumor suppressor gene promoters are heavily methylated, which results in the silencing of the associated genes. Cells that have such hypermethylation tend to divide more quickly, resist cell death and, therefore, outcompete surrounding cells. The deactivated tumor suppressor genes are unable to contain such cellular behavior. The more advanced the cancer, the more CpG island hypermethylation is present.</p>
<p class="western">Sets of CpG islands and CpG island shores are hypermethylated in cancer as well. Methylation of CpG island shores can predict the expression of the promoter. However, hypomethylation of CpG island shores does not necessarily mean gene expression.</p>
<p class="western">Normally, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are heavily methylated. This methylation serves to maintain genomic stability and silence oncogene expression. In cancer, they become lightly methylated. This hypomethylation may lead to improper recombinations between repeats. Usually recombinations occur only between regions in euchromatin that have genetic identity. The hypomethylation activates the repeats, and they contain large regions with very similar DNA, thus enabling recombination. As repeats are activated, they can transpose parts or all of themselves or make copies of themselves and transpose. This results in aberrant insertions and deletions in the genome, triggers the functioning of cryptic promoters and disrupts genes close to the repeats. Such genomic instability contributes to disease. The more advanced the cancer, the greater such genome-wide hypomethylation is.</p>
<p class="western">Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters, while less common than at repeats, also occurs in cancer. It can lead to genes being activated that promote tumorigenesis.</p>
<p class="western">Overall, cancer is associated with locus-specific DNA hypermethylation and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. The role of DNA methylation in cancer is not only specific to different tumors, but also specific to the stage in tumorigenesis.</p></div>
