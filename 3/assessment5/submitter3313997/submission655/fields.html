    <div class="field-value"><p>When normal cells become cancerous, there is a drastic change in the epigenome: there is genome-wide hypomethylation, while the individual CpG islands are highly methylated. CpG Islands are commonly found near the promoters of certain genes (read: near sequences of DNA that cause other genes to be expressed). DNA methylation has various epigenetic effects, but is most commonly associated with the silencing of gene expression. In normal cells, CpG Islands are, for the most part, kept free of methylation. However, in cancerous cells, the CPG Islands become methylated, and not just a little; CpG islands in cancerous cells become hypermethylated. This methylation of CpG islands causes the promoter regions to be silenced, and in turn the previously promoted genes are inactive. Thus, many key proteins end up not being expressed in cancer cells; most importantly, those that actually supress tumors such as p53 are not expressed, resulting in cells with unhindered growth. In the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, two parts of the genome that aren't CpG islands, DNA methylation is used to silence repetetive elements so they don't accidentally splice into useful regions of DNA, and to silence retrotransposons such as LINEs and SINEs. In cancerous cells, the genome-wide hypomethylation removes the DNA methylation from repetitive elements and retrotransposons, allowing them to splice into other parts of the genome, disrupting gene expression at a genomic level. Since many genes can be affected, the cancerous cells do not function correctly and do not help the body function normally. In addition, tumor-suppressor genes may be silenced, causing unregulated growth of cells which can disrupt the normal workings of the human body (read. contributes to disease). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is imprinted, meaning the genes in the cluster are expressed from either the maternal or paternal alleles, but not both at the same time. The Igf2 gene is expressed, in normal cells, solely from the paternal allele. This is because the imprint control region, ICR, is methylated in the paternal allele, so enchancers, which are located downstream from the Igf2 gene and work backwards along DNA to activate genes, skip over the ICR and cause the Igf2 gene to be expressed. On the maternal allele, the ICR is insulated from methylation by a CTCF protein, and the enchancers work directly on an H19 gene and ignore the Igf2 gene, so it is not expressed from the maternal allele. In Wilm's tumor, the hypermethylation of the CpG islands and therefore the ICR in the H19/Igf2 cluster causes CTCF to not bind to the ICR, which causes the maternal allele to behave just like the paternal allele. This gives the diseased person a double dose of Igf2 in those cells; Igf2 is a growth promoter, so those cells would grow and proliferate more than normal, thus leading to tumors and disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that acts as a DNA-demethylating agent. That is, Decitabine removes methyl groups that have been attached to DNA. In doing so, Decitabine removes DNA methylation from the genome. By removing DNA methylation from the methylated (in cancer) CpG islands/promoters of tumor-suppressor genes, the tumor-suppressor genes become reactivated, thus having an anti-tumour effect. In addition, the CpG islands at other promoter regions are demethylated, returning normal gene function (and so cell function) to the previously affected cell. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that lasts throughout cell division. When a cell divides, the two daughter cells have the same DNA methylation in the same spots as the one parent cell. So when the methylation patterns in canerous cells are changed, the cells that come about after normal cell division retain those epigenetic marks. Thus, the effects that come about after the cancerous cells have gone last in the normal cells with the inherited epigenetic marks. A sensitive period describes a time in the development of a human when the epigenetic marks are being reprogramed. This occurs when the embryo itself is being formed in the womb, and when the sperm and eggs are being formed in the fetus inside the mother. It would be inadvisable to treat patients with DNA demethylating drugs during these sensitive periods (such as when the patient is pregnant) because they may cause portions of DNA (in the developing embryo of a pregnant woman or in the developing sperm and eggs in the fetus) that should be methylated to be unmethylated, and may also interfere with normal epigenetic programming during these sensitive periods because of their epigenome-altering actions.</p></div>
