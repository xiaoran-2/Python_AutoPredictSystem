    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA is methylated by addition of a methyl group at the 5<sup>th</sup> Carbon of cytosines by <em>de novo</em> methyl transferase within ~70-80% of CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells. DNA methylation almost universally silences gene expression via: 1- MeCP (methyl-CpG-binding) proteins which either represses transcription by their transcriptional repression domain or recruit other proteins that condense chromatin; 2- stopping transcription factor binding directly due to methylation. Generally, CpG islands are accumulated in promoters of genes where transcription factors bind and are free of methylation allowing normal gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, CpG islands including their shores are hypermethylated –in locus specific manner mostly in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes resulting in excessive cell proliferation,<em> i.e.</em> tumour growth by silencing tumor suppressor genes and making them inactive. Such changes in cancer are also observed in long range manner at megabase range.</p>
<p>Normally, DNA methylation also occurs in intergenic intervals and repetitive elements providing genomic stability. The methylation in intergenic intervals prevents chromosomal abnormalities such as deletions, insertions, translocations. It also silences cyptic promoters or splice sites preventing abnormal gene expression and transcriptional interference, such as two RNA polymerases running in opposite direction and bumping into each other.  </p>
<p>Repetitive elements normally copy and paste themselves via retrotransposing, using gag and pol proteins, into other places in genome, which is mutagenic and could disrupt gene expressions.  Hence, methylation and silencing -also via meC to T mutation- of these repeats prevents mutagenic transposition, transcriptional interference from strong promoters and illegitimate recombination in normal cells.</p>
<p>In cancer, these intergenic intervals and repetitive elements are globally unmethlyated,<em> i.e.</em> genome-wide hypomethylated which lead to illegitimate deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, duplications or loss of chromosomes and cause genomic instability and abnormal cell proliferation and tumour growth.</p>
<p>Possible mechanisms of demethylation include: deamination to thymine by AID/APOBEC1 which is followed by base excision repair or via modification of 5mC via oxidation by the TET family of proteins to 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting indicates expression of certain genes in a parent of origin specific manner, <em>ie.</em> monoallelic fashion. They are found in clusters with their own imprint control regions (ICR), mostly associated with growth. <em>Eg.</em> H19/Igf2 cluster: H19 gene codes for a long noncoding RNA; Igf2 for insulin like growth factor.</p>
<p>Normally, paternal H19/Igf2 ICR is methylated,<em> ie.</em> paternally imprinted which prevents CTCF, an insulator protein from binding to ICR and downstream enhancers are free to promote Igf2 expression from the paternal allele which is thought to be preferred. Igf2 is only expressed from the paternal allele while H19 is paternally imprinted as the DNA methylation of ICR spreads downstream into the H19 promoter which is a CpG island promoter and silenced.</p>
<p>Maternal ICR is unmethlylated and bound <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">by CTCF insulator protein which prevents downstream enhancers to bind Igf2. Igf2 is not expressed from maternal allele, so enhancers act on H19 and increase its expression from the maternal allele possibly via chromatin looping.</span></p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor –childhood kidney tumor, imprinting of maternal Igf2 is lost via hypermethylation of ICR in the maternal allele as well, preventing CTCF binding and Igf2 is overexpressed from both maternal and paternal alleles causing tumour growth as it codes for growth promoting hormone increasing cell proliferation while H19 is silenced completely.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor (DNMTi) class of drug, a hypomethylator but not known if this is their only mechanism of action.</p>
<p>It is a nucleoside (cytidine) analogue, hence upon DNA replication, it gets incorporated into DNA. So, when DNMT comes to bind DNA to methylate a nucleotide, instead it binds to DNMTi –the cytidine analogue- irreversibly with a covalent bond and cannot be released, resulting in DNMT degradation. Therefore, this binding and inhibition of methylation is division dependent and transferred to daughter cells via cell division.</p>
<p>At high doses DNMTi is toxic but in low doses it is tolerated and acts as hypomethylator. Hypomethylation weakens the gene silencing mechanisms of the cancer cells and cause gene activation <em>eg.</em> to tumor suppressor genes most of which are hypermethylated during carcinogenesis thereby shrinking tumours. Since cancer cells divide at a higher rate and replicate more than normal cells, they will be affected more and normal cells can be spared unlike effect of chemotherapy drugs.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Environmental effects on offspring during Dutch famine, Overkalix studies, rodent experiments,<em> eg.</em> Agouti indicated that DNA methylation patterns are affected via environmental changes like diet and passed to children and grandchildren if germ cells are influenced during sensitive periods –times when epigenetic machinery is altered via environment and inherited transgenerationally.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods include active remodelling of epigenetic marks by removal or laying down during: 1- pre-implantation (before embryo implants and makes placenta, zygote time) and early post implantation period: then the epigenetics marks are reset in a cell type specific manner; 2- the period of primordial germ cell development from mid-gestation embryo to the production of mature sperms and eggs.</p>
<p>Additionally, studies showed: pre-conception  –~3 months before pregnancy in humans, ages: 9-12 years for males, 8-10 years for females, <em>ie.</em> pre-puberty, just after birth –experiments on mice- are important periods on epigenetic changes.</p>
<p>Since these epigenetic marks can be transmitted through the gametes, <em>ie.</em> germ cells, therefore any drug treatment causing epigenetic changes during these sensitive periods can potentially have multi-generational effects causing birth defects, imprint disorders or other abnormalities. People treated with these drugs might even be advised not to have children because meiosis on germ cells continues until menopause in females and throughout life in males after puberty too.</p>
