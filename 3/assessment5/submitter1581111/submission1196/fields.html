    <div class="field-value"><p>Talking about DNA methylation we can distinguish methylation of alone standing cytosines, or rather cytosines in CpG dinucleotides and methylation of CpG islands, which can be defined as multiple CpG repeats. In the first case, up to 80% of CpG dinucleotides are methylated in normal DNA of a somatic cell, while CpG islands stay unmethylated.</p>
<p>In cancer one generally tends to observe increase of CpG island methylation which progresses with the increase of cancer malignancy.</p>
<p>When methylation of CpG islands occurs in tumour suppressor gene promotors, like BRCA1, RB, MLH1 and other, this promotes cancer progresion.</p>
<p>Besides promotor regions DNA can be methylated in <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements. These structures are reported to be important for genome stability. In particular, homology between repetitive elements in different chromosomes can cause abnormal (between non-identical chromsomes) recombination events, when these elments are not "hidden" by methylation. </span></p>
<p><span>While usually methylated in normal cells repetitive elements and intergenic regions tend to be hypomethyated in cancer. This hypomethylation is found to be an early event in cancer development which as well as hypermethylation of CpG islands increases with cancer progression. </span></p>
<p><span>Due to hypomethylation of repeats we observe instability in cancer genome with high frequency of deletions, insertions and translocations, forming chimera chromosomes, like famous Philadelphia chromosome. Aberrant chromosomes lead formation of aberrant: truncated, non-functional, misfunctional, chimeric etc. proteins, which in turn promote cancer, if involved in growth or  proliferation control.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal somatic cells <span>the imprint control region in the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated in paternal allele. Because of this it can not be bound by CTCF. H19 gene downstream to ICR (imprint control region) is methylated too and therefore paternally silenced. The enhancers located downstream to the ICR and H19 act onto Igf2 gene promoting its expression. Thus, paternal Igf2 is expressed while paternal H19 is silenced.</span></p>
<p><span>The opposite happens in the maternal allele: the ICR is not methylated and can be bound by insulator protein CTCF. CTCF binding prevents enhancing of Igf2 gene. Instead, the enhancers now act on the H19 promoting its expression. Consequently, meternal H19 is expressed and maternal Igf2 is not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">ICRs are often hypermethylated in cancer, and this also happens in H19/Igf2 cluster in Wilm's tumour. In patients with Wilm's tumour ICR is methylated in both maternal and paternal alleles. As methylation of ICR in this cluster leads to H19 silencing and Igf2 expression, the patient gets double amount of Igf2 protein which is growth promoting. Increased expression of growth promoting Igf2 contribtes to Wilm's tumour deveopment.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors. DNMT catalyses DNA methylation, therefore decitabine inhibits DNA methylation. Currently this drug is approved by FDA for myelodisplastic syndrome which has progressed to &lt;&lt;acute Myeloid leukemia. Myelodisplastic syndrome seems to be dependent on CpG island hypermethylation, because it prevents tumour supressor expression. Therefore inhbition of DNA methylation is effective in this type of cancer.</p>
<p>Technically decitabine makes it impossible for DNMT to release from DNA once it has bound it, and ths it can not function properly any more.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Most of the DNA methylation marks are being set during early developmet and maintained throughout an organism life. However this marks are not "imprinted" into the genome but rather they have to be reistablished with every cell devision by specific enzymes. Inhibiting DNA methylation mashinery might disturb the maintanence of DNA methylation marks in healthy somatic cells and lead to their misfunction. For example cells might loose their lineage specific markers. </p>
<p>Certain time period when cells are  most sensitive to environmental influences is called sensitive period. Some sensitive periods  are associated with epigenetic reprogramming when previous epigenetic marks are being erazed and new ones are established. Throughout development, humans have two such events: first one during preimplantation, in the very early embryonic development, and another one during reprogramming of the germline cells. For particular tissue types other sensitive periods are described, e.g. the first postnatal year for neural cells when neural plasticity is actively taking place.</p>
<p>Treatment with epigenetic drugs would be inadvisable for patients in their sensitive period, e.g. if patient is a pregnant mother. This is because altering the epigenetic mashinery may significanty affect the epigenetic reprogramming of her embryo and so cause various developmental abnormalities.</p></div>
