    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During the normal function of a cell the CpG islands are kept hypomethylated. This does not immediately correspond to their activity or inactivity. In cancer CpG islands become hypermethylated. This can cause silencing of tumour supresor genes or activation of oncogenes. In mormal cells intragenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. This is needed for greater genomic stability by making sure the reapeats are not active. In cancer they tend to be hypomethylated. This can lead to genomic instability by causing insertions of repeates, illegitimate recombinations between repeats and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes. Hypomethylation of the CpG poor promoters, which are in the intergenic regions is another way the DNA methylation contributes to desease by creating an oncogene activation of the genes controlled by these poor promoters.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an anti-cancer drug that has been approved for use by the USA's FDA. It is an epigenetic inhibitor drug that belongs to the class of enzymatic regulators. It acts as a DNA-demethylating agent. It can stop the tumor from growing by changing the DNA-methylation of the cells. This change in turn is mitotically heritable and since the cancer cells are actively dividing it will stop them from doing so by passsing this change onto the daughter cells, which in turn will stop dividing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer by either upregulating or downregulating gene expressions, depending on the particular circumstances. For example, in the H19/lgf2 cluster the paternal allele is methylated and that leads to expression of the lgf2 gene, due to the downstream enhancers binding to it. The maternal allele is unmethylated and this allows an insular protein (called CTCF) to bind to it and block this region. When this Imprint Control Region is blocked then the enhancers act on the area of H19 gene and the gene is expressed, producing lncRNA. This happens due to chromosom looping and lgf2 remains inactive. When imprinting at the H19/lgf2 cluster is disrupted it can cause both alleles to behave like a paternal allele and this can cause Beckwith Wiedermann syndrom. One of the childhood tumors in this patients is called Wilm's tumor, which is a tumor of the kidneys. The reason for it is that we have lgf2 upregulated, being expressed from both alleles, and this gene is an oncogene, i.e. growth promoter. At the same time we have the gene H19, which is a growth supressor, being supressed on both alleles.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering the DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome due to the DNA methylation being mitotically heritable and being passed on to the daughter cells. Sensitive periods are periods of active remodeling of the epigenome - removal and laying down of epigenetic marks. Sensitive periods are the pre-implantation and early development period and also the period from primordial germ cells development to the production of gametes. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods would be inadvisable due to the drugs altering the epigenomic state and thus disrupting the normal epigenetic reprogramming. This can cause epigenetic changes which are mitotically heritable and this way disrupt normal development. </p></div>
