    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>An early event found in pre-neoplastic tissues is the loss of imprinting, probably due to the role of imprinting genes as suppressors, or as promoters of growth.</p>
<p>One example of disruption of imprinting is the H19/Igf2 cluster that is found on human chromosome 11. In a normal cell, the paternal allele has a methylation in the imprinting center region (ICR), while the maternal is not methylated. The consequences of this pattern are that Igf2, is expressed from the paternal allele but not from the maternal one. The mechanism behind this imprinting is that in the maternal cluster (with ICR unmethylated), an insulator protein, CTCF, is bound to the ICR, causing the insulation of Igf2 from downstream enhancers and at the same time, promoting the expression of H19 (long non coding RNA). On the other hand, in the methylated paternal allele, without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence it, and at the same time enhancers can access to Igf2 to activate it. </p>
<p>In cancer tissues this pattern changes because the maternal ICR and H19 are methylated as in the paternal, and it results in overexpression of Igf2 that is a growth promoter. This modification can be found in Wilm´s tumour that is a sort of cancer of the kidneys that occurs typically in children</p></div>

In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic mistakes are clinically relevant in cancer because they progress over time. For example, 5mC decreases from normal to metastatic tissue, it means that 5mC are found in intergenic regions, repetitive elements, and introns of normal tissues but they tend to disappear in anormal tissues. On the other hand, CpG islands (CGI) are unmethylated in normal tissues and become more methylated in metastic tissues. This is related to the fact that these islands are found in tumour suppressors genes and when this genes are silenced through methylation of CGI, it is allowing appearance of tumours. It is important take into account that the set of CGI that are methylated in a metastic process varies between tumour type.</p>
<p>The disruption of DNA methylation at CGI can be hypermethylation which is found in for example retinoblastoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, gliomas and colorectal tumours. On the contrary, other sort of disruption of DNA methylation involves genome-wide hipomethylation especially on repeats and occurs to some degree in all tumour type tested. This hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions can cause genomic instability because they are not densely package so they can cause illegitimate recombination and other abnormalities (transposition, activation of repeats and cryptic promoters etc.). Less common is the hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters that can result in activation of genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyl transferase inhibitors (DNMTi). It is a nucleoside analogue, so it gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication and when de DNMT comes along to bind it to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, the DNMT is bound irreversible. This means that the action of Decitabine it is division dependent. A consequence of this feature is that cancer cells are more affected than normal cells by this drug, because they replicate more frequently, and the DNA is going to end hypomethylated. However, is important to keep in mind that it is not clear how specific this effect is, not only for Decitabine but for DNMTi in general.</p>
<p>Similarly, we do not know for sure why Decitabine is effective in hematological malignancies like myelodysplastic syndrome. Probably it is due to the fact that these diseases are dependent on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation and when this hypermethylation is avoided, the tumour suppressors genes can be active again.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According to the article, the way in which drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects beyond the period of treatment is related to the fact that <em>"epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return.”</em><em> </em>It means that the mentioned drugs actively erased the epigenetic marks related to uncontrolled growing and this effect is conserved through mitosis.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is important to avoid treating some patients with such drugs because it is not clear how specific are their effects. You need to be especially cautious in sensitive periods, when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control. So, it is not advisable to give this drugs when the epigenome is most vulnerable; for instance during periods of extensive epigenetic reprogramming, such as early embryonic development and in gametogenesis, when marks are established rather than maintained. These sensitive periods can be found for instance in younger patients because they are developing germ cells and in pregnant women where the embryonic development and the first stages of PGC of the future baby are found. So, if you use for example a DNMTi in these stages, you not only affect the person who receives it, but also might affect second or even further generations.</p></div>
