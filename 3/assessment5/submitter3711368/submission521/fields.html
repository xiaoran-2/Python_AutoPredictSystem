    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a mechanism of regulating DNA transcription by effecting the binding of RNA polymerase to a promotor. Promotor regions usually contain more CpG (cystine -Guanine) dinucleotide regions than coding DNA.The cytosine nucleotides can be methylated at the 5' location. The DNA regions of the promotor are symetrical due to complementary base pairing.(Chargoff's rule) During DNA replication each strand acts as a template for construction of a new strand. If the cytosine bases are methylated each "parent strand" will  have methylated dinucleotide areas (CpG islands) As replication proceeds a hemi methylated new strand of DNA will result. DNA methyl transferase(DNMT) is an enzyme that recognies the hemi methylated DNA and will methylate the non methylated strand providing for the mitotic heritablility of this epigenetic control mechanism. Methylation of CpG islands blocks the binding  of transcription factors thereby inactivating gene expression.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions and at repetative elements helps to maintain genomic stability by preventing transcriptional intereference of powerful promotors. ( having transcription of two genes occuring in opposite directions and causing a "collision" of RNA polymerase. Methylation of reptative elements may also preven inapproriatet recombination of DNA.</p>
<p>The hypermethylation of CpG islands is mitotically heritable and is known to silence tumor suppressor genes. Hypermethylation at CpG islands reduces expression of growth restricion genes and allows for over expression of growth  promoting genes</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenci regions leading to DNA hypomethylation leads to genomic instability resulting in illegitimate recompinations of repeat units, deletions or insertions and reciprical translocations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Tthe paternal allele  is rapidly demethylation by hydroxylation, DNAmt is excluded from the nucleus. Following blastocyst formation rapid methylation occurs and epigenetic marks are restabilized and  mairtained during somatic cell formation of the epiblast.In both alleles there is a high level of methylation in the repeats  to maintain their silence.The differences of the sex alleles is required for embryo viability. and results in monoallelic gene expression.The proteciton from Removal of DNA methylation in the egg is the result of maternal effect proteins.</p>
<p>In the male, the H19 promotor is methylated at ICR, blocking the CTCF binding and therefore silencing theH19 promotor allowing the enhancers to gain access to and activate the Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>In the female CTCF is unmethylated, and therefore it insulates the Igf2 gene allowint expression of the H19 with help from long nonconding RNA.</p>
<p>Disruption of the h19/Igf2 cluster causes results from abnormalities due to the upregulation of the Igf2 oncogene and loss of Cdkn1c an enzyme that supresses tumors and regulates growth. It is the result of uniprental disomy ( two copies of a chromosome from one parent) This includes the predisposition to Wilms tumor in children due to a loss of iimprinting. There is a loss of DNA methylation at ICRs mostly by enhancer blocking.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors that works by blocking histone methylation of tumor supressing genes.Thereby allowing transcription of the so called tumor suppressor genes. The develoopment of cancer is believed to be a multi hit process (Knudson theory) implying that oncogenes are activated and tumor supresson genes are inactivated.  Decitabine has an anti tumor effect by preventing the deactivation of tumor suprssor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr. Baylin speculates that epigenetic drugs may sensitize tumor cells to standard chemotherapy. This may be possible because of the mitotic heritability of epigenetic marks. DNA methylation is heritable since dnmt recognizes hemi-methlyated DNA, the non methylated strand is recognized and methylated allowing the methylation to be passed on through mitosis. Methylation is a known inhibitor of transcription as would the inhibition of acetylation. According to the article in The Economist, Dr. Baylin showed that preventing the inhibition of histone deacetylase (i.e. allowing for deacetylation) tumor growth was slowed. This may be the result of epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period during which a cell or cellular process is suseptible to specific biochemical processes In terms of epigenetics this would be periods of time when the epigenitic marks are earased. In development the two sensitive periods would be primoridial germ cell development and early cell division as in blastocyst formation</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the epigenetic marks don't exist ( they are erased) and therefore would not be passed down through cell lines during mitosis, making future cells unaffected by the drugs.D</p></div>
