    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation</strong> is an <strong>epigenetic mechanism</strong> that occurs at CpG dinucleotids and, more often, at intergenic regions or repetitive elements. It is laid down by DNA methyltransferases (<strong>DNMT</strong>). It is symmetrical, so it is <strong>mitotically heritable</strong>. In <strong>mammals</strong>, it is established by <em>de novo</em> methyltransferases (DNMT3a and DNMT3b) and maintained though division by DNMT1.</p>
<p><strong>CpG islands</strong> are usually located at gene <strong>promoters</strong>. When a methyl group is added to a CpG island, these promoters –and therefore the gene they belong to– become <strong>silenced</strong>. They are also involved in nuclear condensation.</p>
<p>However, in cancer CpGs islands suffer a locus specific <strong>hypermethylation</strong>. This over-methylation, therefore, produces <strong>over-silencing</strong>.</p>
<p>As a consequence, <strong>tumour suppressor genes become silenced</strong>, so tumour development is more likely to occur. Without these suppressors, cells can grow uncontrollably and invade other tissues. That is why its detection could be one of the hits in Knudson hypothesis. In addition, they appear to happen more frequently than genetic mutations.</p>
<p>At <strong>intergenic regions</strong>, DNA methylation contributes to genome integrity by reducing mutations. For example, it silences transcription sites in the repeats so there cannot be transcriptional interference.</p>
<p>In cancer, these regions became under-methylated. It can happens passively because of a lack of DNMT or actively by enzymatic mediation. Unlike the hypermethylation, <strong>the hypomethylation happens genome-wide</strong>.</p>
<p>This leads to <strong>genomic instability</strong>, as there will be more mobilization of transposons, which, as we have said, are usually silenced by methylation. There will also be other genomic problems like illegimate recombination between repeats, deletions, insertions or translocations. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Genomic imprinting</strong>, along with reprogramming, is a mechanism that clears and resets <strong>epigenetic marks</strong>. Imprinted genes are found in clusters with particular imprinted control regions (<strong>ICRs</strong>) and they are tissue specific. They undergo epigenetic reprogramming during germ cell development. Imprinting is parent-of-origin specific. If a paternal ICR is methylated, and therefore silenced, the maternal is not so it can be expressed.</p>
<p>In humans, <strong>H19/Ifg2 cluster</strong> is located in chromosome 11. In the <strong>paternal</strong> allele, it is <strong>methylated</strong>. The methylations spreads to H19, silencing it. Enhancers can access to Igf2 and activate it. <strong>H19 is silenced and Igf2 is expressed</strong>.</p>
<p>However, in the <strong>maternal</strong> allele, the cluster is <strong>unmethylated</strong>. That way, CTCF (an insulator protein) can binds between Ifg2 and H19, insulating Ifg2 from downstream enhancers. <strong>H19 is expressed and Ifg2 is silenced</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>Wilm’s tumour</strong> both paternal and maternal allele are methylated. As a result, maternal allele behaves like the paternal. <strong>In both cases H19 is silenced and Igf2 is expressed.</strong></p>
<p>This hypermethylation leads to an <strong>overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth promoting gene</strong>. Because of that, cells can easily grow and invade other tissues. This uncontrolled proliferation is one of cancer main characteristics. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent</strong>. That means, it may inhibit DNA methylation or it participate in active demethylation.</p>
<p>As we know, <strong>DNA methylation</strong> is an epigenetic mechanism whose main role is to <strong>regulate gene expression</strong>. In cancer, its establishment is disrupted. As a result, an increase or lack of methylation can activate tumour growth genes that are normally silenced or silence tumour suppressor genes that are normally active. Its effects depends on where specific part of the gene it is located in. Since Decitabine is a demethylating agent, it can be used <strong>for solving DNA hypermethylation.</strong></p>
<p>This phenomenon is locus-specific and usually happens at CpG islands –at gene promoters–, or ICRs, silencing growth restrictions like in the example of H19/Igf2 cluster. The use of <strong>Decitabine would demethylate the wrong marks and reestablish the activation of tumour suppressor genes. </strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According with the article, in the last years the use of epigenetic drugs against cancer has been increasing significantly with good results. However, they also can have some side effects.</p>
<p>One of the main epigenetic marks is the establishment of <strong>DNA methylation</strong>. Consequently, in cancer this mechanism is disrupted. Most epigenetic drugs are focused on reestablish it. This methylation is able to maintain though generations as “epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased” (quote from “Cancer’s center”). It is <strong>mitotically heritable</strong>.</p>
<p>The periods when these marks are cleared and reprogrammed is what we call <strong>sensitive periods</strong>. During these times, DNA methylation is actively or passively removed and then reestablished.</p>
<p>They happen during embryonic development and their aim is to restore cell pluripotency. The two waves of methylation reprogramming are <strong>preimplantation period of the embryo and early germ cell development</strong>.</p>
<p>Therefore, there would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods. That means, if a pregnant mother is treated with epigenetic drugs during one of these times, the <strong>embryo</strong> and even the <strong>future sons and daughters of this embryo</strong> would be likely to suffer <strong>side effects</strong>. </p></div>
