    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands occur in the promoters of many genes. Unlike the CpG islands elsewhere in the genome, CpG islands in promoters are typically unmethylated. The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands involves suppression of an underlying gene by methylation of the CpG islands in the promoter. This function is observed in imprinting and x-inactivation.</p>
<p>Since CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumour supressor genes, disruption of DNA methylation can contribute to disease. CpG islands are found in approximately 60% of promoters and are usually kept free of methylation. In cancer cells, on the other hand, CpG islands in promoters have been shown to become hypermethylated leading to the underlying gene not being expressed. If the gene is a tumour supressor gene then when its expression is reduced or stopped the cell may be able to grow uncontrollably and form cancer.</p>
<p>In contrast to CpG islands in promoters, which are usually unmethylated, CpG islands in the rest of the genome are usually methylated. The majority of the CpG dinucleotides in the genome are found in intergenic regions, repetive elements, or other locations.  However in cancer, it has be shown that there is de-methylation of CpGs at these sites leading to genome-wide hypomethyation.</p>
<p>The hypomethyation in cancer cells most commonly occurs at repeat regions and this suggests the following explanation for its association with tumorigenesis. It is known that one of the functions of DNA methylation is to mantain genomic stability. It is also known that illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes are more likely to occur between repeat regions. These facts combined indicate that hypomethylation of CpG in repeat regions leads to greater illegimate recombination of chromosomes and tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is used to treat <span>myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span></p>
<p><span>Decitabine acts by inhibiting DNA methyltranferase, an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the transfer of a methyl group to DNA. This leads to hypomethylation of the DNA. </span></p>
<p>Decitabine's anti-tumour effect could be explained by the characteristics of CpG methylation in CpG islands in cancer cells. CpG islands are found in approximately 60% of promoters and are usually kept free of methylation. In cancer cells, on the other hand, CpG islands in promoters have been shown to become hypermethylated leading to the underlying gene not being expressed. This suggests that Decitabine's anti-tumour effects are due to its de-methylating properties which act on methylated CpG islands in cancer cell promoters, clearing them of methylation and restoring them to their normal gene expression behaviour. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In the H19/Igf2 cluster the paternal allele is methylated while the maternal is unmethylated meaning that this Imprint Control Region (ICR) is paternally imprinted. H19 is a long non-coding RNA that is produced from the unmethylated maternal allele. When the ICR is unmethylated CTFC binds and insulates LGF2 which leads to enhanced expression of H19 since downstream enhancers are free to act on H19. </span></p>
<p><span>On the paternal allele, when the ICR is methylated CTFC cannot bind so there is no insulation of LGF2 and the downstream enhancers are free to act on LGF2 and promote its expression. As a result lgf2 is only expressed from the paternal allele.</span></p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour individuals are unable to set up expression in a maternal specific manner and instead both paternal and maternal alleles display the expression of the paternal chromosome, leading to overdose of lgf2 and loss of H19 expression.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because once DNA methylation is set it can be mantained over many generations of cell division. This is because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable (daughter cells will have the same epigenetic marks as the parent cell).  When DNA is replicated the daugher strand will be hemi-methylated (one strand methylated). DNA methyltranferase DNMT1 recognises hemi-methylated DNA, binds to it, and lays down methylation on the daughter strand leading to restoration of fully methylated </p>
<p>Sensitive periods refer to periods where the environment is more likely to influence epigenetic makeup.  The period of primordial germ cell development  through to production of mature sperm  and egg cells is  one example. Another is the pre-implanted and early post-implanted period of embryonic development. These periods are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome and the genome appears to be more sensitive to environmental factors (e.g diet). As a result of this, treating patients with drugs during the sensitive periods would likely not be advisable since it could have much bigger, longer lasting, and unintended effects on the epigenome  than treatment during the somatic period.</p></div>
