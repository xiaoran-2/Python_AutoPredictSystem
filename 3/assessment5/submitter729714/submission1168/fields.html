    <div class="field-value"><p>- Describe the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br />DNA methylation is normally used for silencing or inactivating a gene. In normal cells, DNA is not methylated at CpG islands because they are promoters used to express genes.<br /><br />- Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br />CpG islands in cancer cells are more likely to be methylated than in normal cells. This is called DNA hypermethylation.<br /><br />- Explain how disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease.<br />A cancer cell needs to activate and inactivate a number of mechanisms to become a tumor. One of these mechanisms to inactivate are tumour supressors. DNA hypermethylation in cancer cells inactivates genes that are tumor supressors. <br /><br />- Describe the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br />DNA mehtylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is used to increase stability, preventing DNA mistakes such us deletions, reciprocal translocations or insertions. <br /><br />- Describe how DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br />In cancer cells, DNA is not methylated in these regions. This happens genome wide and it is called DNA hypomethylation.<br /><br />- Explain how disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease.<br />DNA hypomehtylation can cause illegal recombinations but also causes that these regions can replicate or transpose thorough the genome, disturbing genes or activating other genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status.  <br />In the paternal allele, Igf2 imprint control region (ICR) and H19 are methylated. This means that enhancers can act on Igf2 that becomes active and H19 is inactivated.<br /><br />- Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status.<br />In the maternal allele, Igf2 imprint control region (ICR) is unmethylated and CTCF can bind to the ICR. Therefore enhancers act on H19, which will be expressed, and Igf2 will be silenced.<br /><br />- Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilms tumour.  <br />In Wilm's tumour, the cancer cells ICR and H19 are methylated at both alleles, so they have H19 supressed and Igf2 expressed for both alleles and therefore they have double dose of Igf2 than normal cells.<br /><br />- Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease. <br />The H19/Igf2 cluster is related to growth genes. By doubling the dose of Igf2, cancer cells are able to influence the growth control mechanism.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.  <br />Decitabine is a FDA approved drug that belongs to the DNA methyltranferase inhibitors class (DNMTi)<br /><br />- Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation. <br />During replication, the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is used to copy the methylation marks from the mother cell to the daughter cell. Decitabine molecules are nucleoside analogues. When Decitabine molecules are present during replication, the DNMT1 binds to them, copying DNA methylation marks to the daughter strand.<br /><br />- Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.  <br />For patients of myelodysplatic syndrome, during the neo-plastic period there is a heavy DNA demethylation in the cancer cells. A very low dose of Decitabine will methylate the replicating cells, causing the death of the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome.<br />DNA methylation is inherited mytotically. That means that daughter cells and grand-daughter cells will inherit the methylation marks that made possible the effect.<br /><br />- Define what is meant by a sensitive period.<br />In relation to epigenomics, a sensitive period is that period where a change in the environment can lead to an important disturb of the epigenetic marks.<br /><br />- Identify sensitive periods of development. <br />Sensitive periods are the period when the epigenetic marks are created during embryo development and the period when the germ-cells are developed.<br /><br />- Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable. <br />Because these drugs are not yet cell specific, so they are disturbing the epigenetic machinery working in the germ-cells development, in the case of young patients. We don't know which long-term effect they will have.</p></div>
