    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG island methylation is rare in normal cells, playing a role in X-chromosome inactivation and imprinting, increasing with age and with <em>in vitro</em> cell culture. Numerous examples of CpG island promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, accompanied by silencing and presumably cell growth advantage.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is frequently disrupted in cancer: typically cancer cells display hypomethylation across the genome, attributed to the loss of methylation at repetitive elements, whereas methylation at gene promoter regions is increased. Particularly, tumour suppressor genes are commonly silenced by hypermethylation of their promoter regions as an alternative to loss-of-function mutations.</p>
<p>DNA methylation was shown to prevent damage from transposed elements such as infectious proviruses by suppressing the capacity of such “selfish” foreign elements to disrupt gene structure and function. This DNA damage–preventing action was thought to be the ancestral function of methylation in invertebrates and vertebrates were thought to have retained this function but additionally had adapted DNA methylation at CpG residues as suppressors of endogenous promoters.  The promoter regions of hypermethylation-prone genes are depleted of repetitive elements and that DNA sequence around the same promoters is evolutionarily conserved. </p>
<p>Disruption of epigenetic processes can lead to altered gene function and malignant cellular transformation. Global changes in the epigenetic landscape are a hallmark of cancer. The initiation and progression of cancer, traditionally seen as a genetic disease, is now realized to involve epigenetic abnormalities along with genetic alterations.</p>
<p>A combinatorial approach utilizing different epigenetic therapeutic approaches along with standard chemotherapy holds significant promise for successful treatment of cancer in future. Such approaches might also help in sensitizing cancer cells, especially cancer stem cells, which are refractory to standard chemotherapy. Further understanding of cancer stem cells along with development of more specific epigenetic drugs may hold the key to our ability to successfully reset the abnormal cancer epigenome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Experimental manipulation of a paternal methylation imprint controlling the Igf2 gene has allowed the creation of rare individual <span>decedents</span> with two maternal sets of chromosomes except for parthenogenone. Hybrid offspring of two species may exhibit unusual growth due to the novel combination of imprinted genes.</p>
<p>The relaxation of IGF2 imprinting in Wilms tumor is associated with methylation of the H19 gene while methylation changes encompass the entire IGF2/H19 domain. DNA methylation changes at the IGF2 and H19 gene loci could reflect one of the 2 following situations: (i) the changes in DNA methylation were specific for the IGF2/H19 locus or (ii) the methylation changes were simply a by-product of a generalized alternation in DNA methylation which is characteristic of many tumors. The specificity of the methylation changes of IGF2 and H19 maternal alleles in which relaxation of IGF2 imprinting had occurred therefore provides evidence consistent with an epigenetic alteration at this locus being central to the tumorigenesis pathway.</p>
<p>Parallels with the XIST gene may provide clues to understanding the events leading to the epigenetic changes at the IGF2/H19 locus. For example, H19 and XIST both act in cis, neither of the RNA products appears to be translated and both genes lie within imprinted regions of the genome. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (DAC) is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).</p>
<p>DAC is only incorporated into DNA not RNA. DAC is cytidine nucleoside analog that become incorporated into newly synthesized DNA where it binds DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in an irreversible, covalent manner.  The sequestration of DNMTs prevents maintenance of the methylation state of DNA, leading to DNA hypomethylation. As a consequence, genes previously silenced by DNA hypermethylation can be re-expressed upon treating cancer cell lines with these DNMT inhibitors.Re-expression of aberrantly methylated genes involved in normal cell cycle control, differentiation, and apoptotic pathways is believed to contribute to the anticancer effects of these drugs.</p>
<p>Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold.   One way that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has long-term changes in phenotype. Within the DNA sequence, there are speciﬁc sites where a methyl group can attach to a cytosine nucleotide through an enzymatic reaction. The sites where this can occur reside primarily within the regulatory regions of a gene, in the promoter area upstream from the transcription start site. At a functional level, methylation prevents access of transcription factors and RNA polymerase to DNA resulting in silencing of the gene. In addition to the gene silencing that occurs in the presence of DNA methylation, these methyl groups attract other protein complexes which promote histone deacetylation, further inhibiting the likelihood of gene expression.  </p>
<p>The susceptibility of the genome to epigenetic modiﬁcations provides a layer of genetic regulation that is sensitive to a lifetime of experiential and environmental factors. Experiences during sensitive periods of development evoke epigenetic modiﬁcations that are particularly robust and long-lasting.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development to help support the view that early environmental influences and infant-caregiver experiences produce lasting epigenetic modifications, stable changes in CNS gene activity, and behavior. </p>
<p>This developmental period in the mammal is the most sensitive to environmental insults for altering the epigenome (DNA methylation) of the male germ line.</p></div>
