    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands in promoters of expressed genes are normally hypomethylated to allow transcription factors to bind to the promoters and promote gene expression. In cancer there is a marked hypermethylation (increase) of CpG islands. If this happens in promoters of tumor supressing genes which are used as regulators of cell division it may cause uncontrolled division of the cell i.e. cancer. </p>
<p>In normal cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated since they are not usually expressed. In cancer unlike the hypermethylation of CpG islands, there is a global hypomethilation (decrease) of the DNA which also includes the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This hypomethylation can cause improper splicing of the genes as well as exposure of the repetitive elements to enzymes that can produce improper recombinations between parts of the chromosomes that usually should not be combined. These improper recombination events can cause genes that should normally not be expressed (like oncogenes) to be under the influence of strong promoters of other genes and be overpresressed. Increased expression of the oncogenes can cause cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of drugs called DNA demethylating agents which inhibit DNA methyltransferase from laying down methyl groups on the DNA. Since Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase the net effect is less methylation of the DNA. In some tumors due to hypermehtylation of tumor suppressor genes their expression is inhibited. This means they they can't do their regulatory job of keeping the cell working properly. Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase which prevents epigenetic scilencing of the tumor supressor genes. This means they will be expressed and keep the cell from dividing uncontrolably which causes tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a form of epigenetic marking of the DNA which is mitotically heritable. Marking the DNA with methyl groups usually has an effect of scilencing genes. Methylation of the gene promoter regions prevents transcription factors from binding to the DNA which prevents the expression of the genes. During duplication of the DNA in cell division the methyl marks are preserved so the epigenetic effect can be lasting.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods during development when environment can play a big role in the epigenetic changes. This includes the periods when the epigenetic marks are actively remodeled as in period of primordial germ cell development to mature gamete as well as pre implantation and post implantation periods. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these periods can cause improper establishment of the epigenetic signature which can cause detrimental effects. For example using an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase as discussed in 3 can cause genes that are supposed to be methylated to be hypomethilated. If these genes are oncogenes due to the hypomethilation they will be upregulated and cause cancer. Expression of some genes can also affect the viability of the embryo.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted meaning that the  imprinting control region of the paternal chromosome is methylated. On the maternal chromosome the ICF is unmethylated which allows binding of CTCF which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. They then act and enhance expression of H19. In the paternal allele since the ICF is methylated CTCF can not bind and the enhancers act on the preferred Igf2 promoter to express Igf2. So normally Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele. Methylation of the ICF on the maternal allele while the paternal ICF is also methylated will cause upregulation of Igf2 which will be expressed from both alleles. Since this is an oncogene and growth promoter, overexpression will contribute to uncontrollable cell division and tumors. Hypermethylation of the maternal imprint control region in the H19/Igf2 cluster can cause cancer.</p></div>
