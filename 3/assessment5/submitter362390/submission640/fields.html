    <div class="field-value"><p>Emerging hall marks of cancer is deregulating cellular homeostasis, resisting apostosis and avoiding immune destruction. Underlying cause being sustaining proliferation and evading growth suppression. Enabling characteristics are gemomic instability and mutation along with replicative immortality. This induces invastion, metastasis and angiogenesis by activating oncogenes and inactivating tumor supression. The above is achieved genetically or epigenetically. One of the chief mechanism of action is Methylation of DNA. This can be locus specific hypomethylation or CpG island hypermethylation. Generally DNA Methylation of the promoter region indicates a loss of gene expression with an exception of CpG island. They are found in 60% of the promoter region. Hypermethylation at this region causes silencing of the underlying gene like tumor suppressor gene causing cancer. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable while epimutations are reversible unlike genetic mutations. Tumor suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutation.</p>
<p>In normal cells CpG promoter regions are generally hypomethylated and Intrgenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. </p>
<p>In Cancer Cells ther is a reciprocal swap with CpG islands hyper methylated and Intragenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. </p>
<p>This causes loss of imprinting and silencing of the gene due to CpG acting as poor promoters. A common epigenetic alteration found in cancer is locus specific DNA hyper methylation also called CpG island methylator promoter (CIMP). This describes a cancer where a group of genes are frequently methylated. Alteration in DNA methylation status at ICRs (Hypo or Hyper) can result in a loss of expression of growth restricting genes and/or over expression of growth promoting genes. Hypomethylation of repeats or intragenic intervals causes genomic instability, illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation, transposition, activation of cryptic promotors and desruption of neighbouring genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process resulting in the monoallelic parent of origin specific expression of a subset of genes.  Expression of these imprinted genes is controlled by imprint control region.</span></p>
<p><span>All identified ICRs to date are marked by differential methylation.  Dominating mechanism described for imprinting clusters is the insulator model and imprinting employed by the H19/igf2 imprinted locus.  </span></p>
<p><span>The maternally expressed H19 gene and paternally expressed igf2 gene share enhancers and their reciprocal imprinting are governed by a CTCF dependent insulator that is located between the genes. On the maternal allele CTCF binds to binding sites within the ICR. This insulator complex prevents igf2 from accessing the enhancers located on the H19 side of the insulator blocking the enhancers.</span></p>
<p><span>On the paternal chromosome, methylation at the ICR prevents CTCF from binding, allowing igf2 to engage the enhancers; since it is required for methylation at the H19 promoter it silences the expression of H19.</span></p>
<p><span>In Wilm's tumor as mentioned above hyper methylation of the ICR causes IGF2 to overexpress as both alleles are activated for IGF2.</span></p>
<p><span>H19 acts as a tumor suppressor gene and IGF2 is an autocrine growth factor, disruption of these causes’ tumourigenesis in wilm's tumor.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The focus on finding DNA aberration and cancer has been long shifted to epigenetic causes of cancer since these changes are reversible unlike heritable mutations. </span></p>
<p><span>Lethal chemotherapeutic agents are replaced by drugs that alter such epigenetic machinery that causes the disease stage.</span></p>
<p><span>This class of drugs act as Diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers for cancer. Several of these are FDA approved and few are in clinical trials with promising results. One of them is Decitabine that acts as an irreversible inhibitor of DNA Methyltransferases that incorporates into DNA and forms a covalent complex with a serine residue at the active site of DNMT resulting in inactivation. This is replication dependent and since Cancer cells replicate rapidly it works in a dose dependent manner.  This drug is used for Haematological malignancies. Since tumor suppressor gene is hyper methylated it is targeted for solid tumors and shows anti neoplastic effect in combination therapy.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Research led by Dr. Stephen Baylin at John Hopkins School of Medicine has shown a combination effect of Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor and DNA Methylation Inhibitor effect to have some promising future. This is a first step towards success in treating solid tumor since this epigenetic drug altered the tumor cells in lasting way that made them more susceptible. DNMT Inhibitors are nucleoside analogous and irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA as they get converted to dNTPs. They trap all DNA methyltransferases and target them for degradation. This process is replication dependent and hence dependent too.  HDIs on the other hand work by preventing Histone Deacetylation, there by facilitating an open chromatin structure and leading to activation of genes. Both mechanisms lack the specificity. Epigenetic drugs are used where epigenetic marks are found.   </span></p>
<p><span>There is a sensitive period for this therapy as the epigenetic reprogramming occurs during germ cell development and primordial gem cell.  Young adults when they go through germ cell development, clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks take place during the formation of egg or sperm. </span></p>
<p><span>Hence the effect of germ cells needs to be considered while treating young adults with epigenetic drugs. </span></p></div>
