    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, DNA methylation shows certain patterns, with areas of hypermethylation and others of hypomethylation. Disruption of these patterns may cause diseases or more severely Cancer. </p>
<p>DNA methylation  of CpG islands at promoter regions of certains genes causes it's silencing. However, CpG islands of active genes (like Tumor suppressor genes) are normally unmethylated. </p>
<p>In cancer cells, promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying Tumor Suppressor gene.Unusually high frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites was termed CIMP (for CpG island methylator phenotype)and was first identified in colorectal cancer. In analogy to genetic mutation, tumors seem to accumulate higher levels of DNA methylation during tumor progression and genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation has proven useful for tumor classification of different tumor types. ( Hassler et al, 2012)</p>
<p>In case of active gene CpG island hypermethylation, the gene is silenced and the phenotype gained by normal expression of the gene is reversed causing disease phenotype expression. </p>
<p>Unike CpG islands, Intergenic regions together with repetitive elements normally show DNA methylation. Such<span> methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated that this maintains genomic integrity.</span></p>
<p><span>In cancer cells, Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repeats takes place. This may cause transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, allow antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing causing transcriptional aberration.</span></p>
<p><span>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements cause further transposition and expression of the transposed genes together with acting as a powerful promter to activate neighbouring genes that may normally be unexpressed. The expression of previously silenced genes causes disease. Example of which is the transposition of IAP in an intron of Axin gene in mice, this causes overexpression of Axin gene resuting in a kinky tail. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On chromosome 11, Imprint Control Region (ICR) separates Igf2 gene on one side from H19 gene and downstream enhancers on the other side.</p>
<p>ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated allowing binding to insulator protein (CTCF). This binding blocks the action of Enhancer on Igf2 gene and so restricting the Enhancer action on H19 gene. The maternal allele shows active H19 and silent Igf2.</p>
<p>Unlike maternal allele, ICR of the paternal allele is methylated blocking the ability to bind to CTCF protein. In this case, Igf2 gene is accessible to the Enhancer causing it's active expression while H19 is silenced.</p>
<p>Normally, igf2 is active on paternal allele and silent on maternal.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, ICR is methylated in both paternal and maternal alleles. This causes Enhancer to activate Igf2 on both alleles and silence H19 on both alleles. Igf2 gene is overexpressed as an oncogene and can be detected in preneoplastic tissues.</p>
<p>Together with H19/Igf2 cluster, CdKn1c gene is located on chromosome 11. CdKn1c is a tumor suppressor gene that is normally expressed on the maternal allele and silent on the paternal allele, making equilibrium with Igf2 expression. The loss of this equilibrium causes Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi) that binds to DNA methyl transferase enzyme irreversibly blocking it's action in DNA methylation of daughter cells after replication. The drug's action is replication dependant. </p>
<p>As DNMT inhibitor, Decitabine prevents DNA methylation causing activation of the affected genes.</p>
<p>The affected genes are Tumor suppressor genes that were silenced by epigenetic aberration due to tumor. By inhibition of DNA methylation, Tumor suppressor genes are reactivated to act in an anti-tumor fashion. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs may alter DNA methylation. DNA methylation is a very stable<span> epigenetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent cell generations. This explains how the drug effect lasts beyond the period of treatment.</span></p>
<p><span>Although being stable, DNA methylation is reprogrammed during gametogenesis and after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). These periods are called Sensitive periods because total deletion and resetting of the epigenetic information takes place through them and the reprogrammed epigenome will be maintained in somatic cells lifelong. </span></p>
<p><span>So any effect that will cause epigenetic changes in this period willhave a permenant effect. This prevents scientists from treating patients with epigenetic drugs at these sensitive periods. </span></p></div>
