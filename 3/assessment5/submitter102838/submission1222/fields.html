    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are dinucleotide clusters, usually found in the promoters and exons of mammalian genes. Normally CpG islands are <strong>unmethylated</strong>. However DNA Methylation of promoter CpG islands has a normal function in <strong>gene silencing</strong>, <strong>genomic imprinting</strong>, and <strong>X-inactivation.</strong></p>
<p>In <strong>cancer cells</strong> CpG islands associated with <strong>tumor suppressor genes</strong> become hypermethylated. This results in silencing of the underlying tumor suppressor gene.</p>
<p>If the tumor suppressor gene expression is successfully silenced by DNA methylation of its promoter CpG island, and if there are enough "hits" (Knudson hypothesis) this leads to reduced inhibition of <strong>cell growth</strong>, decreased <strong>DNA repair</strong>, and reduced <strong>apoptosis</strong>. These in turn promote tumor growth.</p>
<p><strong>DNA hypermethylation</strong> is normally found at <strong>intergenic regions</strong> and <strong>repetitive elements</strong> and these regions are compacted in <strong>inactive heterochromatin</strong>. This functions to maintain <strong>genomic integrity</strong>, prevent <strong>transposition</strong>, avoid <strong>transcriptional interference</strong> from strong promoters, and prevent <strong>illegitimate recombinations</strong>.</p>
<p>In cancer repeats and intergenic regions tend to become <strong>hypomethylated</strong>. This process begins early and progresses with tumorigenicity.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of repetitive elements/intergenic regions leads to <strong>genomic instability</strong> by illegitimate recombination and transposition of repeats, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes, and an abnormal karyotype. This, depending on the tissue, may lead to cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele <strong>DNA methylation at the ICR</strong> blocks binding of CTCF (an insulator protein). Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter and silences it. Enhancers can now access Igf2 to<strong> activate Igf2 expression</strong> from the paternal allele. </p>
<p>In the maternal allele the <strong>unmethylated ICR </strong>is bound by CTCF which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. So there is no Igf2 expression from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, a childhood kidney tunour, there is <strong>hypermethylation of the ICR in the maternal allele</strong> also. </p>
<p>This disruption of the maternal ICR leads to activation of Igf2 expression in the normally silent maternal allele, leading to <strong>Igf2 overexpression</strong> in Wilm's tumour</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <strong>DNA methyltransferase inhibitor</strong>. It targets the enzymatic epigenetic regulator DNMT. </p>
<p>Decitabine is a <strong>hypo- or anti-methylation agent</strong>. Decitabine irreversibly binds DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA thus preventing methylation</p>
<p>Decitabine is replication dependent and thus more severely effects cancer cells, though lack of specificity is inherent in DNMTi action. It was found to have a better anti-neoplastic effect at low doses., and patients tolerate and respond very well with improved life expectancy and quality of life.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and so changes in DNA methylation can be passed on during cell division until removed actively during periods of epigenetic reprogramming.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods in epigenetics are periods of epigenetic reprogramming when fresh epigenetic marks are re-established after demethylation of the genome. </p>
<p>The two sensitive periods of development are during <strong>early embryonic development</strong> <strong>(embryogenesis)</strong> from blastocyst to epiblast, and during <strong>primordial germ cell development (gametogenesis)</strong> , i,e. during spermatogenesis and oogenesis.</p>
<p>Since re-laying and re=programming of epigenetic marks during sensitive periods is essential for the subsequent development and viability of the organism, any drastic disruption, for example by anti-methylation agents during these periods can negatively impact the viability of  the patient's gametes, or if the patient is in early pregnancy, her developing child. </p></div>
