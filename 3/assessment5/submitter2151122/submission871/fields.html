    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>DNA methylation, commonly done at CpG islands, is an important part of normal gene functioning. CpG islands are Cyctocine-Guanine regions that are commonly used as methylation sites, and can alter gene expression based on their methylation state. Depending on the structure of the gene, methylation at the promoter can cause silencing, or switch transcription to an alternate gene. DNA methylation is also found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements to prevent crossover and transposon activation. An increase in the amount of DNA methylation in the genome is a normal part of aging. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>In normal cells, most CpG islands at promoters are unmethylated, while the intergenic regions are methylated. In cancer cells, this methylation is shifted away from intergenic regions and towards promoter CpG islands, causing hypermethylation at promoter sites and hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This reversal of normal methylation patterns contributes to silencing of tumor suppressor genes and to a higher genetic mutation rate though the activation of transposable elements and an increased rate of inappropriate crossover. </span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many genes that regulate cell growth are also imprinted genes. Imprinting is a way for the cell to regulated gene dosage and expression though the methylation of CpG sites on either the maternally or paternally inherited gene.</p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is a set of genes with an imprinting control region (ICR) between the H19 gene and the Igf2 gene. In cells with normal methylation patterns, the maternally inherited gene is unmethylated at the ICR, allowing proteins to bind to this site, and prevent the promoter from reaching Igf2, which causes the transcription of the near by H19 gene. In the paternally inherited gene, the ICR is methylated, preventing the binding of proteins to this site and allowing the promoter to cause transcription of Igf2 instead of H19.</p>
<p>In cancer cells imprinting is disturbed by hyper or hypo methylation at CpG islands, often causing both alleles to either be expressed or silenced. In Wilm's tumor, both the maternally and paternally inherited genes are methylated at the ICRs, causing Igf2 to be expressed in both. This causes the cell to transcribe twice as much Igf2 and no H19. Hyper and hypo methylation of imprinted genes is one of the first epigenetic changes to occur in cells as they become cancerous.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that acts by inhibiting DNA Methyltransferase (DNMT 1 in humans). By inhibiting DNMT 1, Decitabine is able to prevent methylation of DNA after cell division. When DNA is replicated, epigenetic marks are maintained by DNMT1 adding methyl groups to the new strand in areas that have methylation on the old strand. By stopping DNMT1, Decitabine stops the inheritance of the epigenome.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>This is beneficial in treating cancer because hypermethylation of the genome is found in virtually all cancer cells, and causes mutations and aberrant gene expression. By reducing the amount of methylation back to normal levels more normal gene function can be restored and the mutagenic effect of DNA methylation can be lessened. Because Decitabine is cell replication dependent, it effects cancer cells more than it does other cells in the body, farther enhancing it's anti-tumor effects. </span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>DNA methylation is heritable, so any changes to the epigenome will persist through that cell line. When DNA is replicated, preexisting methylation is kept. The new strand of DNA then acquires the corresponding methylation to match the pattern strand. This means that drugs alter DNA methylation will have permanent effects unless that DNA methylation can be restored somehow. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Periods where the epigenome is wiped away and re-established during development are considered sensitive periods. This is because the re-establishment of these epigenetic marks can be heavily influenced by outside factors during this time. There are two sensitive periods in human development. The first is during the blastocyst stage, when the blastocyst attaches to the uterine lining and starts developing differentiated tissues. The second is during formation of the primordial germ cell line, during the creation of gametes in developing a fetus.  </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Treating patients with epigenome altering drugs during sensitive periods is inadvisable because it can alter the natural DNA methylation patterns that inactivate repetitive elements, cause imprinting, and inactivate the X chromosome in females. Without the normal DNA methylation patterns in place, the fetus would run a much higher risk of getting cancer or a developmental disease. </span></span></span></p></div>
