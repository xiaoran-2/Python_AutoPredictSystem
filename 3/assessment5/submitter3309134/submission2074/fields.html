    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation of CpG islands, which often appear at promoters, often turns off the respective gene. This prevents multiple copies of the same gene from activating, as well as allows for cell specificity. In cancer these islands (and their shores) become hypermethylated at certain regulatory genes, thus turning off genes that normally lead to more stable DNA. Normally, the intergenec regions help to govern gene expression, but hypomethelation occurs in these during cancer and can cause the genome to consequently become unstable, by preventing heterocromatin from densly packaging repeats and by preventing methyl groups from inactivating genes and preventing insertions, deletions and translocations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, an imprint control region on the Maternal allele is unmethylated, (as the cell divides, because initial methyl groups were unmaintained) so CTCF can bind to it, and this prevents the enhancers from allowing the gene to be active. The paternal allele is normally methylated (and this is maintained throughout the germination process) and so CTCF does not bind and Igf2 is active. In cancer the GpG islands at Igf2's ICR get hypermethylated causes the gene to become active like the paternal allele, creating a double dose of Igf2 in Wilm's tumour, and since Igf2 is a growth factor, twice as much can encourage abnormal growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, which hypomethelates the DNA within a cell by inhibiting DNA Methyltransferase, and can have an anti-tumour effect by allowing regulatory genes to reactivate, which then begin silencing genetic duplicates and other parts of the genome what need to be methylated,, and can help treat cancer when combined with standard chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome when the modifications are targeted at regulatory genes. Turning on regulations that had previously been off, can allow the DNA to regain stability and begin righting itself. The effects of the regulatory genes at this point would no longer be dependent on continued drug use (in fact, continued use of drugs like Decitabine could unnecessarily hypomethylate the cell, potentially preventing the regulatory proteins from methylating DNA where it is needed), sensitive periods are ones in which the epigenome is most vulnerable to environmental stimulus, usually when the epigenome is being reset in fetal development. Treating patients who are pregnant or nursing could have unintended effects on the child (who isn't suffering from cancer) by heavily altering methylation patterns, and if in early pregnancy, could go as far as to effect the grandchild of the patient.<br /><br /></p></div>
