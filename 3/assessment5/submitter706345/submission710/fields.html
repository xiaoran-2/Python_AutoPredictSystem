    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>5mC is found in 70-80% of CpG dinucleotides and is involved in normal functions such as X inactivation, imprinting and selectively silencing the expression of certain genes. Promoter CpG islands are usually unmethylated and their aberrant hypermethylation in cancer cells leads to silencing of the underlying genes. Silencing of tumour suppressor genes together with other mutations in the genome and other epigenetic transformations may eventually make the cell resistant to apoptosis and give it survival advantages over the rest of the cells in that tissue. Other parts of the genome on the other hand - including <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements - are generally hypermethylated, and this prevents them from being expressed in most tissues. their hypomethylation however happens due to aging and cancer, which can in turn facilitate new mutations (generally chromosomal instability leading to insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocations) or overexpression of oncogenes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many imprinted genes including the H19/Igf2 cluster exhibit growth control properties. As the imprint control regions (ICRs) are methylated on only one of the alleles - in this case the paternal chromosome - enhancers work to activate H19 on the maternal chromosome and Igf2 on the paternal chromosome and therefore each cell gets a regulated dose of each gene product. The maternal Igf2 in a normal cell is silent as CTCF binds to the unmethylated ICR to act as an insulator to prevent the effect of enhancers on Igf2. However if the maternal ICR also gets methylated - as in the case of Wilm's tumour - this allele will also get expressed and we will get a double dose of Igf2 which will act as a growth promoter leading to an uncontrolled division of this clone of cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNMT inhibitor class of DNA demethylating agents.They are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursor of AML. As the methylation profile of MDS is consistent with hypermethylation of the CpG islands, the use of a DNMTi at this stage will be advantageous to reverse the aberrant hypermethylation and probably "re-express" the silent genes (e.g. tumour suppressor genes) and thus exert its anti-tumour effect, however the exact mechanism of action of this drug is still to be identified.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation can be passed on to subsequent generations of daughter cells and grand daughter cells as the hemi-methylated DNAs in daughter cells inherit the methylation profile which is completed by the action of DNMTs. A sensitive period is defined as a developmental period where we have reprogramming of the epigenetic information; this happens during gametogenesis and early embryonic development. Altering epigenetic properties at these stages can have deleterious impacts especially to the offspring, therefore patients at this stage (either pregnant or willing to become pregnant, in both genders) are advised not to be treated by epigenetic modifying agents.</p></div>
