    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Methylation is one of the most studied epigenetic marks in relation to Cancer epigenetics. In a normal cell the CpG islands are mostly unmethylated which is related to the expression of genes that are associated with tumor suppression. When these CpG islands are hypermethylated then the expression of these tumor suppressor genes get silenced which could then in combination with other insults to the genome for example an expression of an oncogene could result in a tumor formation. These methylations are mitotically hereditable which make this tumor development mechanism an effective one. This hypermethylation of tumor suppressing CpG island genes could be seen in a variety of cancers including breast and colon. Also these CpG methylations has been found at an increase level with the passage of time and development of the cancer from a localized tumor to a metastatic state which in part may be related to the mitotic heritability of the methylations patterns in a cell.</span></p>
<p><span>On its counterpart the methylation in a normal cell especially in the repetitive elements, intergenic regions and even in the introns of the genes are highly methylated but when we look at the same regions on a cancerous cells this methylation has been lifted and in this case the aforementioned regions are considered hypomethylated. The role of the methylation on these regions is one of chromosomal structural stability and when is disrupted we can see problems like deletions (pieces of the chromosome missing), insertions (pieces from a different chromosome in another chromosome) and translocations (switching of pieces from one chromosome into another chromosome), all this insults have been found in cancerous cells and produce genomic instability which could then  present expression of undesirable genes or disruption of the genes that were supposed to be expressed which could result in cancers. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Imprinted genes are genes that show parent of origin expression.  Igf2/H19 gene is one of these imprinted genes. In a normal cell the imprint control region of the paternal Igf2 allele is methylated while the same region in the maternal allele is unmethylated. this methylated region in the paternal allele promotes  expression of the Igf2 gene via the action of some enhancers that act over it, meanwhile, unmethylation of the maternal ICR promotes the expression of H19 gene and attracts a CTCF which blocks the effect of the enhancers on the maternal Igf2 region blocking the expression of it in the maternal allele. This well regulated system make way to the optimum production of Igf2 factor which is related to growth meanwhile the H19 is related to growth control, making them a system that control embryonic development. When this system is aberrant as in the case of hypermethylation of the ICR then both alleles behave like the paternal allele in which case there is an over expression of Igf2 (now both alleles are expressing it) and no expression of H19 which has as  a consequence the development of Wilms tumor which is a kidney tumor found in children’s.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent which means that it will remove methylations in the genome. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which are blood cells aberrations and are the precursors of myelogenous leukemia. by its method of action it could be said that the main target will be the removal of the hypermethylation related to CpG island of tumor suppressor genes  in cancerous cells which if its effective then it will reinstate the expression of these genes  in which case could restore the normal function of  cells. And because again its mechanism is by  manipulating a mitotically hereditable mark (methylations) it will be an excellent mechanism of tumor control. It means that the daughter cells will inherit the new less methylated or rightly methylated  CpG islands which will then express the tumor suppressing genes in an expected manner.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Methylation is one of the most studied epigenetic marks its demonstrated that is a highly conserved mark , mostly because it is mitotically hereditable, specially at regions like the CpG islands. This particular characteristic of the methylation pattern in a cell is an asset when the cell is behaving as its supposed to, but it could be prejudicial when this methylations are placed in a detrimental manner in a cell as is the case of cancer when the tumor suppressing genes CpG islands are hypermethylated.</span></p>
<p><span>There are some periods in which the organisms are more sensible at changes on the epigenome; these periods are the early development of the embryo and the gametogenesis. In this periods the methylation are mostly removed and then lately regained (epigenetic reprogramming). Studies on the environmental effects on the agouti allele has demonstrated that changes on the environment (in this case methyl rich donor diet) could affect the phenotype of the offspring, not by changing the genotype but by altering the epigenome of it. That means that if someone would try to treat a patient during this sensitive periods theoretically not only will affect them but the possible offspring that this patient will have.</span></p>
