    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often found within the genome at promoter regions and DNA methylation at these sites leads to silencing of these promoters and reduced expression from the genes the promoters control. DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to primary effects such as changes to a repressive chromatin structure and the region is then able to be secondarily bound by other factors that ultimately leads to an overall inhibition of transcription factor binding and altered gene expression. Disruption of this normal CpG methylation in cancer is by locus-specific DNA hypermethylation at these CpG island regions and the 'shores' 2kb upstream and downstream of the islands. Hypermethylation at the islands leads to silencing of tumour suppressor genes and is mitotically heritable and frequent in all tumour types although the identity of affected loci varies between tumour types eg RB for retinoblastomas, BRCA1 in breast cancers. Hypermethylation at the shore regions reduces gene expression. Hypermethylation progresses over time and so varies with tumour stage. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated to maintain genomic integrity by maintaining genomic stability, silencing transcriptional interference from cryptic promoters, silencing cryptic splice sites, preventing transposition and preventing illegitimate recombination. In all types of cancer, there is genome-wide hypomethylation at these regions, which is progressive and occurs early in tumorigenesis. The consequence of this hypomethylation depends on the location affected; at repetitive and intergenic regions, hypomethylation promotes illegitimate recombination between repetitive elements, activates repeats and transposable elements, activates cryptic promoters and disrupts neighbouring genes. These factors promote genomic instability that lead to alterations in gene expression and genetic mutations. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting contributes to cancer either by locus-specific DNA hypermethylation at imprint control regions (ICRs) or genome-wide hypomethylation at ICRs. Both mechanisms lead to loss of imprinting and aberrant gene expression that can lead to cancer and other disease. The H19/Igf2 cluster is found on human chromosome 11 and is a paternally imprinted region. The ICR of the paternal allele is normally methylated, preventing the CTCF insulator protein from binding. DNA methylation then spreads to the downstream H19 promoter region, silencing expression of the H19 long non-coding RNA. Via chromatin looping, downstream enhancers act on the Igf2 locus, an oncogene, activating expression of that gene from the paternal allele. In contrast, the maternal ICR of this region is unmethylated, allowing the CTCF protein to bind. Via chromatin looping, CTCF binding allows downstream enhancers to activate expression of the H19 lncRNA while insulating the Igf2 locus. Ultimately, the H19 lncRNA is expressed while Igf2 is silenced on the maternal allele. In Wilm's tumour, there is hypermethlation of the H19/Igf2 ICR and both alleles are methylated. This causes the maternal allele to behave like the paternal allele and results in overexpression of the Igf2 gene. Because this is an oncogene, cellular growth is promoted and Wilm's tumour, a childhood kidney tumour, results.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA-approved DNMT inhibitor, a DNA-demethylating agent. It is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into DNA during DNA replication and subsequently binds DNMTs irreversibly, inhibiting their methyltransferase activity. This mode of action is replication-dependent and so 'selectively' targets cancer cells because of their comparatively high replication rate compared to normal tissues. At low-moderate doses, the DNA demethylation activity is high and good anti-neoplastic effects result. At these doses, decitabine is well-tolerated, although the long-term side effects due to its non-specific mode of action are still unknown. It is currently approved for myelodysplastic syndrome progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia and its action in haematological malignancies can be understood because of their dependence on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation once established is mitotically heritable, although demethylation can occur through both passive (dilution during cell division) and active (enzymatic removal mainly via TET) processes. DNA methylation is laid down by the de novo methyltransferases DNMT3a and 3b and during cell division, methylation is maintained on the daughter strand by DNMT1. Because of the mitotic heritability of DNA methylation, drug treatments altering the methylation state will endure beyond the period of drug treatment. A sensitive period is a period during organism development, during epigenetic reprogramming, that is susceptible to environmental signals. Epigenetic reprogramming naturally occurs during early embryonic development (pre-implantation) and again during primordial germ cell development. Other tissue-specific epigenetic reprogramming also occurs at alternate time periods. Treating patients with drugs that alter epigenetic programming should be avoided during these sensitive periods because the drugs would interfere with epigenetic reprogramming which would then be mitotically heritable. These alterations would have drastic consequences on the developing organism or offspring, including embryonic death and infertility and disorders such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Angelman syndrome in the offspring. </p></div>
