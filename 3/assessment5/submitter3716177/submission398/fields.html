    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is related with silencing of gene expression. In a normal cell we can see hypomethylated CpG islands. But, we find that the genome, in general, is methylated in the repetitive elements, through the intergenic regions and in the introns of the genes. Unlike, at cancer cells, the CpG islands are now hypermethylated, not all but the most, while the rest of the genome, e.g. repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns, are hypomethylated. </p>
<p>In general, CGI hypermethylation is found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, this is a very good locking down mechanism in terms of epigenetic silencing and development of cancer. DNA methylation can be one of the multiple hits in the Knudson hypothesis, according to which cancer is the result of many hits to DNA, genetically or/and epigenetically. That means silencing of tumor suppressing genes and activating of oncogenes will end up forming a tumor. This kind of epimutation gives to the (cancer) cell the advantage of dividing more quickly than the other cells of the surrounding tissues, that's why is rapidly selected. </p>
<p>Examples of genes, which are related with CpG island hypermethylation and cancer, are RB in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer, BRCA 1 in breast cancer, MGMT in gliomas and colorectal tumors. </p>
<p>On the other hand, genome-wide hypomethylation is well studied at repeats and promoters with low density of CpG islands (CpG poor promoters), something that potentially may lead to an activation of an oncogene. </p>
<p>One of the consequences of hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic intervals is genomic instability, which can lead to illegimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. For example mutations in DNMT3B gene result in ICF (<span>Immunodeficiency, Centromere instability and Facial anomalies) </span>syndrome. There's evidence from many human cancers. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genes that display monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression are named imprinted genes. A lot of genes that are imprinted are involved in growth (promoting or suppressing). We 've found, so far, hypermethylation and hypomethylation of imprint control regions (ICR) in cancer, depending on the particular imprint control region and the function of the genes that are found within the control region. </p>
<p>In a normal cell, as Igf2/H19 cluster is concerned, the imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. At the last one, CTCF factor binds on the ICR allowing the enhancers downstream act on H19. Igf2 will be silent on the maternal allele, as we don't see expression. On the paternal allele, because the imprint control region is methylated, the enhancers can act on Igf2, while CTCF don't bind on ICR. That's why Igf2 gene is expressed. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, there is hypermethylation of ICR at both parental alleles, so we have loss of imprinting, leading to overexpression of growth promoting factor. Double dose of Igf2 expression by both paternal and maternal allele, in comparison of the normal cell, is associated with cancer, childhood kidney tumor specifically (Wilm's tumor). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are several classes of drugs that act like epigenetic inhibitors. Some of these are: DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi), histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), histone methyltransferase inhibitors (HMTi), histone acetyltransferase inhibitors (HATi) and histone demethylase inhibitors (HDMi). Decitabine belongs to <strong>DNMTi</strong> class of drugs. It's a nucleoside analogue and, as a DNA-demethylating agent, binds irreversibly to the DNMT enzyme, after it's incorporated into DNA, therefore it depends on replication and cell division. </p>
<p>Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, is FDA approved and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes progressed to acute myelogenous leukaemia. Haematological malignancies are dependent on the hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes. That's why Decitabine is effective in treatment of this disease, preventing the over-action of DNMTs and hypermethylation of DNA. </p>
<p>DNA demethylation and anti-neoplasmic effect of Decitabine lacks of specificity, because of its replication and cell division dependent mechanism of action. That's why there might be potentially long term effects on normal cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It has been found that combination of drugs, that target epigenetic machinery, can treats heamatological malignancies, so and solid tumours. But some of these drugs led to a good reaction to the chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on the patients next. Epigenetic changes (alteration of DNA methylation) it's known that are mitotically heritable, so are passed on during cell division to daughter and grand-daughter cell until they are actively erased. Since they are erased, they do not return. So <span>epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. </span></p>
<p><span>A sensitive period is a period in the life-circle of a human being when epigenetic reprogramming occurs (e.g. DNA methylation at imprinted genes and repeat elements). </span></p>
<p><span>A main sensitive period of development is the <strong>pre-implantation period at the early development</strong>, before placenta formation. It endures from zygote to blastocyst. The other sensitive period is the <strong>primordial germ cell development</strong> by the time of mid-gestation untill the development of gonads. <span>The maintenance of pluripotency within this cell population may arise through epigenetic modifications that suppress somatic differentiation programs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Treating younger patients during sensitive periods is, so far, inadvisable. There is a wariness because of the potential drug effects on germ cells, causing <span>lethal mutations. </span></span></span></p></div>
