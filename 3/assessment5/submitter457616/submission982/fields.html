    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>According to the recommended review paper, cytosine methylation occurs on “approximately 70-80% of CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells... Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state.” </span></p>
<p><span>The story is different in cancer.  Here, CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated.  This can silence gene expression and disrupt regulation of important cell functions.</span></p>
<p><span> “This causes … silencing of tumor suppressor genes - controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair - by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands”.</span></p>
<p><span>This CpG hypermethylation has a direct effect on cancer by disrupting the ability of cells to control and limit cell growth and to eliminate damaged cells.</span></p>
<p><span>In intergenic regions the opposite phenomenon is observed.  CpG dinucleotides in these regions are normally highly methylated.  This is thought to contribute to genomic stability in a number of important ways.</span></p>
<p><span>“Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA. Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing.”</span></p>
<p><span>The methylation of repeats and retroviral insertions will suppress transcription of these elements and stop further degradation of the genome due to insertions, improper recombinations and deletions.</span></p>
<p><span>In cancer, these regions become hypomethylated.  This can contribute to disease by disrupting genomic stability.  In particular, demethylation of repeats in intragenic regions may allow the reactivation of jumping elements.  This could lead to further DNA mutation.  The effect on disease is clear given the view that cancer is the accumulation of a chain of mutations.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region (“ICR”) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is imprinted by methylation of the paternal allele.  This methylation spreads to the promoter of the paternal H19 gene.  This silences the paternal copy of H19 and allows downstream enhancers to activate the paternal copy of Igf2.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the normal absence of methylation allows CTCF to bind the ICR.  This blocks the downstream enhancers from activating the maternal Igf2, silencing this gene and concurrently activating maternal H19.</p>
<p>This imprinting can be disrupted in cancer.  Dr. Blewitt said “one of the really common features of cancer cells is that they display loss of imprinting.  So in other words, genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent-of-origin expression … no longer show this imprinted expression.”  With a loss of imprinting, the maternal ICR can become hypermethylated.  As on the paternal allele, CTCF will then not be able to bind and this will cause activation of the maternal Igf2 gene due to the action of the downstream enhancers.  Igf2 is a growth factor and the double dose of this growth factor has been associated with Wilm’s tumor which is a childhood disease of the kidney.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According to the Economist article, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent</span>.  The recommended website goes further noting that this drug is a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">DNA methyltransferase inhibitor</span>.  The drug may inhibit the enzymes responsible for de novo DNA methylation, in which case the increasing hypermethylation of CpG islands noted above as a hallmark of many cancers may be disabled.  Additionally, the drug may inhibit the copying of DNA methylation marks during mitosis.  If so, then as cells divide, within a few generations the methylation marks already placed on CpG islands prior to drug administration will essentially disappear by dilution.</p>
<p><span>Regardless of the mechanism, the DNA-demethylating agent Decitabine may restore normal CpG island <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hypomethylation</span> and reverse the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and genes involved in apoptosis and DNA repair thus halting tumor growth and allowing apoptosis to eliminate damaged cells that cannot be repaired</span>.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As noted above, epigenetic drugs can alter global DNA methylation.  Although this may be enough to eliminate hypermethylation at CpG islands, the drugs may not be able to eliminate existing tumors.  Cells damaged by mutation of the apoptotic pathway rather than silencing provide a case in point.</p>
<p>Though this system wide demethylation from the drug may endure and be enough to stop new progress from the disease, chemotherapy may still be required to help shrink or eliminate existing tumors.</p>
<p>That said, there are two periods of significant epigenetic reprogramming (the “sensitive periods”) that need to be considered when thinking about epigenetic drugs.  The first sensitive period is during early embryonic development prior to implantation.  At this time, essentially all epigenetic marks are removed from the embryo except those associated with imprinting.  The second sensitive period is during gametogenesis when new imprinting marks are being established.  This is a particularly important consideration for young women whose gametes are reprogrammed in late puberty. </p>
<p>It may be inadvisable to administer epigenetic related drugs during these periods as they may compromise embryonic development or imprinting leading to mortality or imprinting related disorders such as Wilm’s tumor or Beckwith Wiedeman syndrome.</p></div>
