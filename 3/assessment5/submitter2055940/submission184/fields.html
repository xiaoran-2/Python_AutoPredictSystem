    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation disruptions that can lead to cancer are either hypomethylation or hypermethylation processes depending on the tumour type, the stage of the cancer and the region of the genome that is affected. An example of particular regions that are affected are CpG islands. In a normal cell, CpG islands are non methylated in general, which in the case of tumour suppressor genes promoters implies a normal functioning of those genes, that are active. However, in cancer, these CpG islands become hypermethylated, provoking a silencing of the tumour suppressor genes and therefore contributing to the disease. This hypermethylation can either be in the CpG islands or in the "shores", which are the regions surrounding the CpG islands, 2kb upstream and downstream, and may be better predictors of the gene expression. However both alleles of the tumour suppressor genes would need to be silenced in order to contribute to cancer, coupled as well with other factors such as activation of oncogenes for example. Methylation disruption can also be genome wide and affect intergenic regions and repetitive elements. The repeats are normally hypermethylated in healthy cells to mantain genomic instability. This methylation assures that the repeat elements are within regions of densely packed chromatin and therefore silenced and unavailable. When the repeat element become available and active due to hypomethylation (ie. open chromatin) some abnormalities can occur. These are recombination between repeats due to their similarity (that provokes traslocation in chromosomes) and activations of the repeats that lead to their replications, deletion or insertion in other places of the genome, often inducing activation of other genes and provoking transcriptional aberrations. This genomic instability can contribute to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Loss of imprinting can contribute to cancer when genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent of origin specific expression start to be expressed or silenced from both parental alleles. Disruption of imprinting can either occur by hypomethylation or hypermethylation depending on the particular region, and the second is the case of H19/Igf2 cluster that will be used here as an example. In a normal cell, the Imprinted Control Region (ICR) of the paternal allele is methylated and therefore the enhancers can act on Igf2, which is expressed. In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing the CTCF insulator binding that results in the enhancing of H19 and the lack of expresion of Igf2. In the Wilm's tumour, the ICR of the maternal allele is methylated and therefore this allele functions as the paternal one, expressing Igf2 and leading to a double dose of this molecule. Because Igf2 is a growth promoter, the disruption of this imprinted region can contribute to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of the FDA approved drugs for the treatment of cancer. It belongs to the category of DNMT inhibitors, provoking the demethylation of DNA after its replication. In Myelodysplastic Syndrome this demethylation can be particularly effective because this type of cancer is coupled with CpG island hypermethylation. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that gets incoporated into the DNA upon replication. When the DNMT comes along to bind the nucleotide in order to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, it stays irreversibly and cannot longer be released. Cancer cells may be more affected by this drug because it acts only on cells under division and such cells replicate more rapidly. However the specificity is not determined and it could be acting on the normal dividing cells as well, and long term effects are unknown. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have indeed lasting effects because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter cells until they are actively erased definitely. Sensitive periods are those when the environment may be able to influence the epigenetic makeup. Those periods that are sensitive to epigenetic control are two: 1) the period from primordial cell development to the production of mature gametes and 2) the preimplantation and early postimplantation period. These are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome and therefore more sensitive to changes in the environment. Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because this drugs are used in all the system so every cell has the potential to be affected by them. Thus, this could cause a disruption of the epigenetic machinery in the normal cells of these patients, particularly in developing germ cells, in a higher probabiity due to the epigenetic changes occuring during these periods.</p></div>
