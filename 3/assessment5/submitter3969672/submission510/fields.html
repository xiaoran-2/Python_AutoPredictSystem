    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Usually CpG islands tend to be protected from DNA methylation (a small group of CpG islands are dynamically methylated), in order not to silence gene expression. However, in cancer, CpG islands are hipermethylated, which is an alternative way (instead of genetic mutations) to silence tumor supressor genes. This is considered an epimutation, which, in opposite to a genetic mutation, is reversible. This hipermethylation occurs frequently in tumors, and, as the CGI methylation progresses with time, this epimutation probably affects more the older patients. CGIs identity also differs by tumor type.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions are usually methylated (in order to maintain genomic integrity) and repetitive elements (in order to prevent ilegitimate recombination). But, in cancer, both intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, which will lead to genomic instability. This genomic instability can be caused by the clearing of Dnmt1 in specific tissues, for example. This hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements can cause illegitimate recombinations between repetitions, activation of repetitions and transpositions, and also activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinted control region is paternally imprinted, in other words, methylated in the paternal allele, and unmethylated on the maternal allele. When this imprint control region is methylated, as in the paternal allele, the insulator protein CTCF can't bind, so theres no insulator action and the downstream enhancers can act on Igf2, so it will be expressed. When this imprinted control region is unmethylated, as in the maternal allele, its bound by CTCF, which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers, so it will be expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's, the imprinting is lost and there is an overexpression of growth promoting genes, and maybe this overexpression of the growth promoter genes (which, as the growth supressing genes, control the growth) is the reason why, patients with disrupted imprinting in the H19/Igf2 cluster have predisposition to embryonic/childhood tumors but not adult tumors.</p>
<p>A disorder in imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease because it can result from abnormalities in growth (supressing or promoter) genes or in tumor supressor genes or in oncogenes, resulting in abnormalities in growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors, and it irreversibly binds DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA.</p>
<p>Decitabine has an anti-neoplastic effect, so it kills the tumor cells (which seem to cause DNA methylation).</p>
<p>Decitabine is more efective in myelodysplastic syndrome. The reason is still unknown...</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs can have side effects which can affect the patient life and his offspring. DNA methylation is mitotically hereditary, so alterations in DNA methylation will change the way DNA methylation will be inherited.</p>
<p>This drugs musn't be taken in the sensitive periods (the sensitive periods are the epigentic reprograming periods, like primordial germ cell development, pre-implantation period and early post implantation period) because it can modify the epigenetic machinery for all life.</p></div>
