    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation's contribution to cancer consists of genome-wide hypomethylation and tumour suppressor hypermethylation.</span></p>
<p>In normal conditions, DNA methylation at CpG islands entails methylation of 5’ group of cytosines within CpG dinucleotides.  However, in cancer, an aberrant epigenetic control occurs, where the CpG islands are hypermethylated (increase in epigenetic methylation) and tumour suppressor genes are silenced. This CpG island hypermethylation occurs frequently in tumours, and due to DNA methylation being mitotically heritable and these epimutations being rapidly selected, tumour growth is no longer supressed effectively, and therefore contributes to disease progression.</p>
<p>In normal conditions, DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements maintains genome integrity. However, in cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are genome-wide hypomethylated (decrease in epigenetic methylation). This hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements results in genomic instability, which leads to an abnormal karyotype due to gene activations or illegitimate recombination, and therefore contributes to disease progression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in the imprint control regions (ICRs) leads to loss of imprinting by locus specific DNA hypermethylation and by genome-wide hypomethylation. ICR DNA methylation does not necessarily correlate with silencing of gene expression, as its mechanism of action varies with each cluster. In regards to the H19/Igf2 cluster, on the human chromosome 11, enhancer blocking occurs.</p>
<p>In normal conditions CTCF binds to the maternal allele, and allows for the expression of H19, whilst the ICR of the paternal allele is hypermethylated, and therefore, Igf2 expression is silenced.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour both the maternal and the paternal ICR regions are hypermethylated, and therefore H19 in the maternal allele is silenced and Igf2 in the paternal allele is enhanced, and therefore overexpressed. Thus, overexpression of Igf2, which is an oncogene, and silencing of H19, which is a tumour suppressor, contributes towards tumour growth, and as a consequence to disease progression. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, known as a DNA methyltransferase(DNMT) inhibitor or a DNA-demethylating agent, is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. This drug, which is FDA approved and currently being used amongst patients, targets the epigenetic machinery. The nucleoside analogues of Decitabine irreversibly bind the DNMT’s after they are incorporated into the DNA, and inhibit further DNA methylation. This process is replication dependent.  This drug has an anti-tumour effect because it targets hypermethylated areas, which are associated with tumour progression, and therefore tumour suppressor genes can be activated and expressed as a means of inhibiting tumour growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that target the epigenetic machinery, and alter DNA methylation, could last beyond the period of drug treatment, as epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells, until they are actively and permanently erased. Therefore, epigenetic therapies could possibly prevent cancer growth without having to kill each and every cancer cell.  Although drugs targeting epigenetic machinery are currently generating great excitement due to the possible cancer treatment breakthrough, one must be reminded that epigenetic modifiers are not recommended during sensitive periods, those in which epigenetic reprogramming can occur (early development/primordial germ cell and gamete development). Thus, when treating younger patients with these drugs, one needs to consider germ cells effects, as these could have severe repercussions on future generations. </p></div>
