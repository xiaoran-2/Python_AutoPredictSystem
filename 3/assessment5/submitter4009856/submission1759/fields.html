    <div class="field-value"><p>Stretches of DNA that are CpG rich (CpG islands or CGIs) are predominantly devoid of methylation. CpG islands are found in more than half of the promoters of genes. The addition of a methyl group on the 5' cytosine of a CpG dinucleotide is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure leading to silencing of gene expression. Methylated CpGs can be bound by methylated CpG binding proteins (eg. MeCP1 and MeCP2) which possess a transcriptional repression domain and can also recruit other chromatin condensing factors. Methylated CpGs can also prohibit transcription factor binding influencing gene expression. In cancer, CGIs within promoters tend to be hypermethylated. Hypermethylation of CGIs called CIMP has been found in tumours. Methylation of CGIs in the promoter of the MLH1 gene is involved in Lynch syndrome. Tumour suppressor gene promoter hypermethylation leads to silencing of the gene and can result in cancer. This is due to loss in cell cycle control, resistance to apoptosis, genome instability or metastasis. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and epimutations which act like mutations are easily selected. Hypermethylation was also shown to accumulate progressively over time. All these factors can result in cancer and disease. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements under normal circumtances are methylated to maintain genome integrity and prevent transposition, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and prevent illegitimate recombination. These characteristics act as a defence mechanism for the genome. In cancer there is a loss in DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Thus in cancer the genome defense mechanism is nullified. This results in genomic instability due to ilegitimate recombination between repeats, transposition of activated repeats and altered gene expression due to activation of cryptic promoters. Genomic instability is a characteristic feature of the immunodeficiency, centromeric region instability, and facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many imprinted genes are involved in growth, thus, loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer and diseases. The imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster on the paternal allele is methylated. This methylation prevents binding of an insulator protein called CTCF. Without the binding of CTCF, the DNA methylation spreads to the promoter of the H19 gene, which expresses a long noncoding RNA, silencing this RNAs expression. Downstream enhancers are now able to act on the Igf2 gene and activate its expression. On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated, therefore, CTCF and other cofactors are able to bind to the ICR. This blocks expression of Igf2 but the enhancers can now act on H19. Loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can cause Wilm's tumour by the silencing of normally active maternal H19 and aberrant methylation of the ICR. This disease is caused by the maternal allele behaving like a paternal allele. Igf2 is suspected to be an oncogene and thus an increase in Igf2 is growth promoting. Biallelic expression of Igf2 or paternal uniparental disomy were both ICRs are methylated leads to Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome and predisposes individuals to Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors. Decitabine is a cytosine analogue and is incorporated into the DNA. There it binds DNMTs irreversibly, inhibiting DNA methylation in the 5' position of DNA. This drug has global DNA demethylating action at low doses, however, at high doses this drug is toxic due to excessive incorporation of the drug into DNA resulting in cell cycle arrest. This drug is considered to have an anti-tumour effect because of the general reversal of methylation-mediated silencing. Critical genes such as tumour suppressor genes, involved in cancers, may be reactivated and thus the drug will have an impact on cell function. Treatment of haematological malignancies such as melodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has been positive since they are dependent on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altered DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because it is mitotically heritable (inherited by progeny cells). These epigenetic alterations can be actively reversed unlike genetic changes and that is why there is a sudden surge in the development of epigenetic drugs. Any periods of epigenetic reprogramming, that is the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks, are known as sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are when epigenetic marks are established during embryogenesis and in gametogenesis. The effects of the epigenetic drugs are not specific but rather general and random. Treatment with an epigenetic drug in a pregnant woman would be ill-advised as epigenetic reprogramming during embrogenesis (of the fetus) as well as epigenetic reprogramming in the fetus' primordial germ cells (PGCs) could be altered. Resetting of epigenetic marks accompanies differentation of many cell types of the body and extraembryonic tissues. Imprinted genes are reprogrammed during germ cell development and this may be disrupted. Epigenetic marks are maintained during adult life, however new methyl marks are established in the germline throughout sexual maturity. Particularly in the female germline, methylation imprints are established after birth. Oocytes remain demethylated until puberty. Thus in young children these drugs would be inadvisable.</p></div>
