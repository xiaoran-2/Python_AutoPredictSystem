    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer can be considered to be the result of genetic mutations in the DNA coupled with abnormalities in epigenetic control. In general, DNA is protected from methylation and when present is an inactive epigenetic mark. Ordinarily DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotide islands results in diminished gene expression. DNA methylation of CpG islands in intergenic regions or in areas with repetitive elements silences expression thus preventing transpositions, mutations, transcriptional interference or illegitimate recombination. However, DNA methylation of CpG islands in the genome can be mutagenic or a destabilizer of the genome as methylated cytosine(meC) when deaminated becomes thymine(T) and therefore can then possibly alter the genome by various processes (deletion, translocation, duplication, insertion, etc.). It is these destabilizing changes which can alter the genome and thus provide the basis for genetic mutations that may be seen in cancer. Most DNA methylation when normally present occurs at promotor regions which supress gene transcription by binding with proteins which alter transcription domains and/or by recruiting other factors which condense chromatin.</p>
<p>Cancer being a result of genetic mutations and/or epigenetic abnormalities is associated with overall hypermethylation of CpG islands (which can promote genomic destabilization changes that alter the genome or result in activation of oncogenes) along with locus specific hypermethylation resulting in inactivation of tumor supressor genes at promotor sites. Hypermethylation of CpG islands resulting in tumor supressor inactivation is associated with retinoblastoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer and gliomas. Hypomethylation of locus specific CpG islands results in expression of intergenic regions and repetitive elements that cause genomic instability through illegitimate recombinations, activation of repeats and transposition as well as activation of cryptic promotors and disruption of neighboring genes. Hypomethylation can activate oncogenes as seen with activation of RAS in gastric cancer and miR21 inactivation of PTEN in glioma.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If genes which are either oncogenes or tumor supressors or are effected as a result of methylation of DNA at Imprint Control Regions (ICRs), unchecked cell proliferation can occur leading to cancer, depending on the clusters involved. This cycle of events is seen with the dysregulation of the Kcnq1 and H19/Igf2 ICRs that causes Beckman-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) and Wilm's Tumor (WT). Cdkn1c when expressed is a tumor supressor/growth supressor and Igf2 is an oncogene/growth promoter.</p>
<p>In (BWS) and (WT), the Kcnq1 cluster on the maternal allele when methylated promotes production of Cdkn1c and the unmethylated/insulated (CTCF) H19/Igf2 promotor does not produce Igf2. The paternally imprinted H19/Igf2 ICR allele promotes Igf2 production and  if maternal imprinting of the Kcnq1 cluster is lost either as a result of mutation, translocation, deletion, uniparental disomy, or epigenetic disruption, etc. on the maternal ICR cluster, there is no production of Kcnq1. In essence, this is similar to having two copies of the parental allele which produces H19/Igf2 (oncogene) with no tumor supression from Kcnq1 and therefore excessive, unchecked growth is produced leading to fetal and post-natal overgrowth and embryonic/childhood tumors. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decatibine is a DNA demethylating agent and probably exerts it action either by blocking the de novo methyltransferases (DNMTs) or enhancing the action of demethylases. Demethylation most likely should effect tumorigenesis by supressing oncogene production and downregulation of proliferative stimuli. With cancer already being present it is unlikely that demethylation of CpG islands would reverse or protect the genome from further destabilazation. Demethylation could also effect the cancer genome by preventing epigenetic marking via the hemimethyltransferases and therby disrupt and possibly deregulate rapidly multiplying cells as occur with high mitotic activity as in cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation as we have seen can have numerous effects on the genome (destabilization via deamination of cytosine to thymine; stabilization via inactivation of repetitive marks and transpositions, etc.) as well as activation of promotor regions, Imprint Control Regions (ICRs) and allelic clusters, etc. Drugs which alter epigenetic marks, in this case DNA methylation, can have lasting effects beyond the period of drug treatment. This is in essence the definition of epigenetics: the study of mitotically heritable changes in the gene expression which occur without alteration in DNA sequence. A drug which alters epigenetic marks will be passed on to daughter cells and perpetuate, modify or delete various gene expressions.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods occur in development, especially in the blastocyst stage and during maturation of primordial germ cells in which epigenetic marks are removed to allow for development of stem cells which subsequently undergo further changes and remethylation to produce differentiation of various cell types. Blocking of remethylation during these sensitive periods could alter fetal development and cell differentiation and therefore these drugs should no be use during pregnancy. Similarly in younger individuals undergoing germ cell development, these agents could produce germ cell alterations and tumors.  </p></div>
