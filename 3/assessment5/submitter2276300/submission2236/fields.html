    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are groups of many repetions of Cytosines followed by Guanines, which are usually located in the promoter area of many genes. When these areas are methylated, the nearby genes are not expressed. In cancer CpG islands are highly hipermethylated compared to normal cells. It has been shown that this is associated with loss of gene function of tumor supressor genes.</p>
<p>While in cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated, at a global view, the overall levels of methylation of the whole genome are lower than in normal cells. Specially in areas with low content of genes, such as repetitive elements or retrotransposons and introns, cancer cells are hipomethylated. This leads to genomic instability, due to a higher rate of translocations and cromosomal rearangements.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="western">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating drug, which means it removes the methyl groups atached to DNA. Since DNA methylation inhibits the expression of nearby genes, when it happens on an area that regulates a tumor-suppressor gene, it might lead to cancer. Therefore, by removing the methylation in these genes, DNA-demethylating drugs could potentially have an anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="western">By definition, epigenetics are those changes to DNA that, without altering the DNA sequence, are inherited during meiosis or mitosis. DNA methylation is one of these epigenetics mechanisms and therefore, once it is altered in a cell, all its descendents will inherit those modifications. This includes the effect of drugs, since once the drug has been taken and certain methylation parameters modiffied, the effect will persist until the methylation patters are actively modified again.</p>
<p class="western">Since DNA methylation is one of the ways to indicate a cell which genes it should express, and therefore, decide which cell type it will become, in multicelular organisms it is usually modiffied deppending on the phase of the reproduction and development cicle. There are certain moments in which there is a higher concentration of modifications to the DNA methilation patters, such as -in humans- when the gametes are being formed, or in certain phases of the embrio development (i.e. blastocyst). These are known as sensitive periods, and therefore it should be specially careful when using drugs that modify DNA methylation during these phases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
