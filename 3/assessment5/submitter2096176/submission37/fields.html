    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually unmethylated and is associated with gene silencing when found at promoters. It leads to silencing by the formation of a repressive chromatin structure as well as prohibiting transcription factor binding and therefore altering gene expression. In cancer, CpG islands often become methylated, turning on genes which are normally silenced such as oncogenes. DNA methylation is now recognised as being one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis. Aberrant methylation is frequently found in tumours. Cancer arises from oncogenes being activated and tumour suppressors being silenced. </p>
<p>The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic stability. The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity. The silencing of repeats prevents transposition and illegitimate recombinations. Introns and repetive elements are normally found methylated to silence them thereby maintaining genomic stability and genomic integrity. In cancer, the DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted and there is a hypomethylation at both regions. This results in genomic instability so transcription start sites are turned on and transposons aer now able to move around the genome and may cause illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation of repeats and transpositions, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouting genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele is methylated and the maternal allele is unmethylated. IGF2 is paternally expressed as the DNA methylation imprint is on the paternal chromosome. Imprinting at the H19/IGF2 locus is disrupted in Wilm's tumour by uniparental disomy. This is where you get 2 chromosomes from one parent, in this case it is 2 chromosome 11s from the father which reuslts in a child with Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome. The loss of imprinting can occur due to epigenetic disruption. In patients who have no CDKNC1 expression and up regulation of IGF2 so are promoting growth, then they would display both foetal and post-natal overgrowth. They also have a large tongue and are predisposed to embryonic or childhood tumours, the most ocmmon being Wilm's tumour of the kidney. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitibine is DNA methylatransferase inhibitor which results in hypomethylation of DNA. It is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly binds to DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, therefore they are replication dependent. Becuase cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells, they would be most affected by the drug. And so this would result in hypomethylation of the cancer cells. They are dependent on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation may have enduring effects on the epigenome as DNA methylation is thought to be mitotically heritable so with each cell division this epigenetic change would be incorporated. A sensitive period is a time period when epigenetic changes would have the biggest effect and would have long-lasting effects in the individual, they are the stages when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control. The sensitive periods of development include those periods of epigenetic reprogramming - early development and primordial germ cell development. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as there must be caution wherever germ cells may be affected. This could have lasting effects on any offspring this infant would have. </p></div>
