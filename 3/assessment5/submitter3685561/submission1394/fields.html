    <h1>Submission 1394 from Anon (session_user_id: 63f15ffd51666c2b0062dc0046fa6dc34aa19ba7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor and is used to treat the leukemia  myelodysplastic syndrome. This means that the DNA-demethylating agent acts to reduce the amount of methylation in the genome. Ideally, as this drug reaches the tumor, it will act on the methylated areas of the DNA. As these areas become less methylated, the previously silenced genes, such as tumor suppressers, can reactivate. Especially in euchromatin areas, the inhibitor acts to reverse the DNA methylation and allow the cell to return to more normal functioning.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are generally unmethylated and metholation occurs in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In cancerous cells, the CpG islands often become methylated and the methylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements may be reduced. Specifically, methylation occurs in regions of promoters of tumor suppressing genes. This silencing of the promoters and hence those genes allows the tumors to grow and flourish.  Methylation of the intergenic regions and around the repetitive elements of normal cell silences these areas and may maintain the integrity of the gene.  When these areas become unmethylated, as the cell divides, the repeats may cause the genes in the new cells to lose sections, trade portions of the gene or even insert additions portions of the gene into the chromosome.  Thus, the new cells are diseased and may continue to grow uninhibited by other protective factors of the body.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A normal cell is paternally imprinted. On the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated and silences the H19 promoter. This allows the enhancers to act on Igf2 allowing Igf2 to be expressed. However, in the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, which allows the insulator protein, CTCF, to attach to the ICR.  The enhancers are blocked from acting on Igf2, and instead promote H19. According to NLM Genetics Home Reference “The function of [H19] is unknown, but researchers believe that it may act as a tumor suppressor ...” (http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/H19).  This makes sense as the combination of the over-expression of the oncgene, Igf2, and the suppression of H19 can lead to childhood tumors (Wilms tumor).<br /><br />Disrupting the imprinting and allowing either the material gene to resemble the paternal or to actually have two paternal genes, means the normal balance between cell growth and tumor suppression is undone.  In addition over production of the growth promoting Igf2, both Cdkn1c and potentially H19 are tumor suppressors and are silenced. Disruption as genes normally silenced become promoted or vice versa lead to expression of disease characteristics.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>First, as described in question 3, if a drug is able to reverse the effect of the cancer on the epigenetic marks, either by activating silenced genes or silencing active ones, the cell may regain its normal functioning.  As the cell divides, the daughter cells shed the epigenetic marks (generally methylation or hypermethylation) of the cancer.  This means the tumor grows smaller and, ideally, self-destructs.<br /><br />For the second part, sensitive periods in human development those in which methylation, de-methylation, resetting of the epigenetic marks, and re-methylation occur as a natural part of the development of the embryo.  Two key sensitive periods are woman in the early embryonic development, from pre- to post- implantation, stage of pregnancy or for whom germ cell development was occurring.  Drugs could upset the process by forcing methylation or de-methylation to occur too early or too late or prevent the reprogramming of epigenetic marks. Additional sensitive times may include occur during childhood, for example, growth spurts or when organs are growing or altering.</p></div>
