    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG is not as common as random choice, and is usually <strong>methylated, which usually inactivates </strong>(silences) the sequence where it is found.  Normally it <strong>is used to silence specific genes or repetitive elements</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, there are <strong>“islands” where the CpG is unmethylated</strong>, with high ratios of CG and CpG to promote mammalian and human genes to keep them active.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cancer will <strong>methylate the CpG islands, silencing the mammalian and human genes</strong>, as well as the <strong>tumor suppression genes</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cancer also <strong>demethylates the intergenic regions</strong>, <strong>activating unwanted genes</strong>, so the cell stops responding to normal controls and starts uncontrolled growth.</p>
<p>Cancer also activates the repetitive elements, generating uncontrolled RNA strings affecting the genome with many mutations (moving, inserting, deleting and transposing strings), which causes more uncontrolled activity.  This results in an unstable genome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The sperm has methylated the H19 non-coding RNA, so this is the paternal ICR.  Without the RNA, downstream enhancers will methylate an upstream CTCF binding site.  This allows another enhancer to activate a paternal Igf2 growth promoting gene.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The egg has an unmethylated H19 non-coding RNA, and this is the maternal ICR.  This RNA will silence a downstream enhancer, so the CTFC gene will have a CTFC protein.  This insulating protein will block another downstream enhancer from activating the upstream Igf2 maternal gene, so the maternal Igf2 growth promoting gene is silenced.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the maternal genome has a methylated H19 site, it will act like the paternal ICR, and both chromosomes will activate the Igf2 gene, and twice the amount of the growth promoting (oncogene) will be produced.  This can result in a childhood kidney tumor.  This is called wilms’ tumor, after Dr. Max Wilms, who first described it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is twice the normal amount of the growth promoting oncogene Igf2.  We do not know what else these enhancers motivate, or what they silence.  But doubling the oncogene Igf2 will increase the probability of cancer.  30% of children with wilms’ tumor have this defect (Wikipedia quoting 2007 medical research)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, sold by Eisai as Dacogen, is a DNA demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>
<p>Mutations cause EZH2 enzyme (histone-methylator and chromatin compactor) to become overactive</p>
<p>Hypermethylation silences the tumor-suppression genes.</p>
<p>BRD4 (a BET protein) promotes more Myc, which leads to uncontrolled growth of cells.</p>
<p>Blocking BRD4 reduces Myc, slowing the growth of tumor cells</p>
<p>John Hopkins School of Medicine showed that a histone deacetylase inhibitor and a DNA demethylating agent slowed the growth of advanced lung cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent.</p>
<p>By removing methylation of CpG islands, the tumor-suppressing genes are activated again</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, when DNA is duplicated there are enzymes that will copy the methylation to the new daughter strand.  So when a cell divides, both daughter cells have the same epigenome as the original cell.  So any changes in the DNA methylation will change the future copies of the epigenome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This article defines epigenetic environmentmust be stable during cell divisions to conserve cell identity, but also to react to cell intrinsic signals during development  or to external factors to adopt to altered environmental cues.,</p>
<p>Sensitive periods would be cell division and reprogramming the epigenome, during gametogenesis and after fertilization.  There are also periods when the epigenome is sensitive to the environment.  The Overkalix study has the sensitive period for grandfathers at 9-12 years and grandmothers at 8-10 years or fetal/infant life.  This is during the reprogramming during the maturation of the sexual organs.  The reprogramming after fertilization-epiblast time and again during germ cell and primordial germ cell development (PGC or GC)</p>
<p>When there are changes in the nuclear architecture (such as cell division), there is a sensitivity to some environmental signals, such as chemotherapy or epigenetic drugs/proteins.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods increases the probability of mutations or other epigenetic abnormalities</p>
