    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer to behave opposite of what is normally expected.  Promoters at CPG islands are typically un-methalyted, and these become hypermetholated in cancer.  This causes unexpected silencing of the underlying gene, which are often tumor suppressor genes.  This allows cancer tumors to grow unchecked.  In addition, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is typically methalyated, but in cancer these regions become hypo-methalyated.  This causes many forms of genomic instability when repeats or intergenic regions are affected.  These instabilities include illegitamite recombination between repeats (deletions, translocations, and insertions) resulting in activation of repeats, cryptic promoters, and causing disruption in neighboring genes. Hypomethylation also occurs in regions of CpG poor promotors (though this is less common) and results in activation of genes (often oncogenes).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele, but the maternal allele remains un-methylated.  This causes CTCF4 to bind as an insulator and H19 to be expressed on the maternal allele.  The paternal allele expresses Igf2 because there is no insulator binding at the ICR.  With the loss of imprinting in Wilms Tumour, the ICR becomes methylated on the maternal allele as well, causing expression of Igf2 on both alleles.  Because Igf2 prompts growth, it causes tumorogenesis and is associated with Wilm's tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of drugs that are DNA methyl-transferase inhibitors, which are incorporated into the DNA when it is replicated, so that when the DNA methyl-transferase is binding to the given nucleotide, the drug molecule binds to the DNA metyl transferase, inhibiting its action.  The reason this is effective is because the action of this drug depends on cell division, and cancer cells are dividing more rapidly then regular cells.  The drug needs to be given in low doses however, so that regular cells are not as adversely affected.  It is particularly effective in myelodysplastic syndrome which may be because its possibly dependent on CpG island methylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic marks are inherited and passed down to the daughter cells.  There are periods during embryonic and priomordial germ cell development where these epigenetic marks are being laid down on the genome, and these periods are known as sensitive periods, because any environmental changes or changes that affect how these marks are applied could have effects for generations.  Although early embryonic development and germ cell development are the most widely discussed sensitive periods, the entire gestational period, plus the early years of childhood development, even into puberty should be considered a sensitive period as well, given that the epigenome may still be flexible during these times.  Treating patients with epigenetic drugs would be inadvisable during these periods, as it is probable that these drugs would alter the epigenetic state that could be inherited not just through the child's cells but potentially through the forthcoming generations.</p></div>
