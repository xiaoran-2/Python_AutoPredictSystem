    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands involves an important role in epigentic gene control during mammalian development. In most cases, the CpG islands are normally unmethylated but can become methylated in the specific cell types and various pathological conditions. During the process in the development of cancer in mammalian cells, CpG islands upstream of gene promoter  are abonormally hypermethylated that results in transcriptional gene silencing and are inherited by the daugther and grand daughter cells folllowing cell divison. In normal cells, CpG islands are unmethylated and coated by proteins such as transcription factors and co-activatorsthat protect against DNA methylation and its establishment. During stem cell immoblization and replication, DNA methyltransferases are recruited at some of CpG islands, depositing methyl groups which develops methyl pressure on them. The recruitment of DNA methyl-transferases is speculated to have linked to repetitive DNA sequences and/or retrotransposons, which disrupt the  CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) that results in the spread of methylation in transcription sites, triggering gene silencing. There are many genes that go under hypermethylation in cancer which are involved in cell cycle regulation (p16, p15, Rb), DNA repair (BRCA1, MGMT), apoptosis, drug resistance, detoxification, differentiation, angiogensis and metastasis. Therefore, silencing of these genes via disrupting their CpG islands can consequently result to cancer.Compared to the normal cells, malignant cells show higher rate of disruptions in their methylation.The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genome stability. In cancer or oncogenic cells, interspersed repetative DNA sequences are hypomethylated, which leads to significant elevation in mutation rates, activation of tumor causing genes and loss of imprintin. Demethylation of repetitive elements induce the activation and transposition leading to chromosomal instability due to permessive transcriptional activity at the centromere, which consequently results into abnormal growth tumor development potentially leading to the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 clusters are genes encoding for long noncoding RNA. It is speculated that genomic imprinting is arisen due to the conflicting intrests in maternally and patternally inherited genes within a pregenancy. </p>
<p>H19/Igf2 has a differentially methylated region which is an imprinting control region (ICR). The ICR is differentially methylated at the CpG islands inheritated paternally. In general, the paternal copy of H19 is methylated and slience whereas, maternal copy is hypomethylated and is expressed in progeny during the gestation period. </p>
<p>In normal cells, both the paternally inherited Igf2 and maternally inherited H19 genes are expressed. There are many sites upstream of the H19 that methylated in the copy inherited paternally and unmethylated on the maternally inherited copy. </p>
<p>In the Wilms' tumor with loss of gene imprinting, the maternal chromosome is reversed to the paternal epigenotype, having paternal  pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter. Here, Igf2 is turned on and H19 is turned off which results into increased cell growth. Loss of gene imprinting in H19 on the maternal chromosome occurs independtly when occures and or is influeneced by events in the paternal chromosome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent, that inhibits DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It causes the hypomethylation of  single stranded DNA by covalently binding with DNA methyltransferases which prevents subsequent cytotoxicity and solid tumor growth by reactivation of silent tumor-suppressor genes and induction of differentiation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr. Stephen Baylin's specultation that "<span>epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy." is quite possible to have its effects beyond the period of drug treatment since epigenetic changes are passed on during the cell division to daughter and granddaugther cells. There are senstive periods of developments such gastrulation, gestation  and childhood development periods where one should avoid treating patients with such drugs. The childhood development is a major sensitive periods of development that include ages from birth to age 6. These sensitive periods of development involve absorbent mind of sensory learning of all five senses, language, body coordination and so forth. It is strongly adivised to avoid treating patients during these sensitive periods of development since it can result gene imprinting and consequent development of disease in later stage of life and/or in future generation. </span></p></div>
