    <div class="field-value"><p class="hg-tinymce-code">Epigenetics can be defined as a stable alteration in gene expression potential that takes place during development and cell proliferation, without any change in gene sequence.  DNA methylation on the other hand is described as a biochemical process where an additonal methyl group is added to the cytosine or adenine DNA nucleotides.  DNA methylation is brought about by a group of enzymes known as the DNA methyltransferases.  This results in the alteration in the expression of genes in cells as mitosis takes place and differentiation progressing from the embryonic stem cells into specific tissues. During zygote formation DNA methylation is removed and re-established through successive cell divisions during development. It can be that some methylation modifications regulating gene expression are inherited and can cause genomic imprinting.  DNA methylation is necessary for normal development.  It is not only associated with genomic imprinting but also with X-chromosome inactivation, supression of repetitive elements and carcinogenesis.  It is also an important regulator of gene transcription as well as essential during ebryonic development.  Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. As compared with normal cells, malignant cells show major disruptions in their DNA methylation patterns.It is known that cancer is a disease of multiple pathways and genetic lesions.  These are necessary to develop a fully established tumor.  For epigenetic lesions it is the same.   The presence of CpG island promoter hypermethylation affects genes involved in cell cycleDNA repair, carcinogen-metabolism, cell-adherence, apoptosis etc.  It is known that a profile of CpG island hypermethylation exists according to the tumor type. One of the most critical steps in giving CpG island methylation its true value is the fact that it should occur in the absence of gene mutations. Both events (genetic and epigenetic) abolish normal gene function and their coincidence in the same allele would be redundant from an evolutionary stand-point. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

<p>Instructions for making insulin-like growth factor 2 is provided by the IGF2 gene.  This protein is essential in growth and development before birth.  Research suggests that insulin-like growth factor 2 promotes growth and proliferation of cells in different tissues.  The IGF2 gene is more active during fetal development than in the adult body. </p>
<p>A copy of genes from both parents gets inherited.  Both copies are typically  active, or "turned on," in cells. The <span class="geneSymbol">IGF2</span> gene, however, the copy inherited from a person's father is the only active copy in most parts of the body. This sort of parent-specific difference in gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting.</p>
<p><span class="geneSymbol">IGF2</span> is part of a cluster of genes on the short (p) arm of chromosome 11 that undergo genomic imprinting. Another gene in this cluster, <span class="geneSymbol">H19</span>, is also involved in growth and development. A nearby region of DNA known as imprinting center 1 (ICR1) or the H19 differentially methylated region (H19 DMR) controls the parent-specific genomic imprinting of both the <span class="geneSymbol">H19</span> and <span class="geneSymbol">IGF2</span> genes.  In Wilm's tumor methylation on the paternal allelle is lost and IC1 gains methylation on maternal allelle. Epigenetic reprogramming occurs on both parental chromosomes resulting in epigenetic changes in the kidney as pre-neoplastic events in Wilm's tumorigenesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation and histone deacetylation contribute to the malignant transformation of cells by silencing critical genes. Drugs that inhibit DNA methyltransferases or histone deacetylases have the potential to reactivate silenced genes and induce apoptosis of malignant cells.     Decitabine is an anti-cancer chemotherapy drug.  Decitabine is classified as an "antimetabolite" and a "demethylation" agent. It is given intravenously.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Studies have shown that  combinations of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth. This was the first time epigenetic drugs had been deployed successfully against a solid tumour.  </p>
<p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells, and epigenetics might justly take its place alongside genetics in the analysis and treatment of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancers are caused by a combination of changes to the genome and the epigenome. Adding  or removing methyl groups can switch genes involved in cell growth off or on.  If such changes occur at the wrong time or in the wrong cell, they convert normal cells into cancer cells that grow wildly.  Drugs may alter epigenetic homeostasis by direct or indirect mechanisms. Direct effects may be caused by drugs which affect chromatin architecture or DNA methylation. For example the antihypertensive hydralazine inhibits DNA methylation.  With more chronic exposure, cells adapt by an unknown hypothetical process that results in more permanent modifications to DNA methylation and chromatin structure, leading to enduring alteration of a given epigenetic network. Therefore, any epigenetic side effect caused by a drug may persist after the drug is discontinued. </p></div>
