    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is uncommon and usually associated with gene silencing. Under normal conditions, CpG islands are usually unmethylated, intergenic regions are usually methylated, and repetitive elements are methylated. meCpG in CPG islands are associated with formation of repressive chromatin structure, a 1° mechanism. This prohibits transcription factors from binding, a 2° mechanism. DNA methylation is a mutagenic which means methylated cytosine is prone to deamination to thymine. DNA methylation at intergenic regions maintain genomic integrity (e.g., deletions, translocation, duplication). They also silence cryptic transcription sites. DNA methylation at repetitive element also maintains genomic integrity by silencing long terminal repeats to prevent transposition. In cancer, there is hypomethylation at intergenic regions and hypermethylation at CpG islands. This leads to genomic instability and deletions and insertions. When there is hypomethylation at an intergenic region and repetitive elements, there is genomic instability due to deletions and insertions into the genome. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal genome experiences rapid and active DNA demethylation. This means quick Igf2 expression. Genes are more likely to be inherited from the father. The maternal genome experiences passive demethylation which means passive Igf2 expression. In Wilms’ tumor there is DNA methylation at the H19 promoter, therefore silencing H19. H19 influences Igf2 which influences cell growth to promote Wilms’ tumor. H19 represses Igf2 expression, which is a tumor suppresser, so if there is DNA methylation, tumor suppressing genes are not able to repress cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According to the article, the influence of drugs on the epigenome is possible for expression or silencing of genes versus treating the genes themselves. Epigenetic markers such as DNA methylation are easier to use as treatment. Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. Decitabine demethylates methyl groups that attaches to histones. This can have an anti-tumor effect by allowing tumor suppressing genes to be expressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation plays a profound effect on gene silencing. If there is DNA methylation at a promoter, the gene will not be expressed. Therefore, the effects of DNA methylations are sustained throughout cell division. Sensitive periods occur during the establishment of epigenetic marks, rather than maintenance. Sensitive periods occur during early development and primordial germ cell development. Treating patients during sensitive periods affects imprinting. Treating a patient during a sensitive period would not be ideal because it interfere with the establishment of epigenetic marks, which might influence other genes. There are critical periods which create the epigenetic landscape which are applicable to treatment and behaviors. These are able spread throughout the genome.</p></div>
