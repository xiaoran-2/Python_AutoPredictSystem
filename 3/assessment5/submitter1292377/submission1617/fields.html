    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span> the normaly  CpG islands not methylated only repetitive element, intergenic region and introns of genes can methelated. cancer cells CpG island likely methelated, repetitive elemenet, intergenic region and introns of genes are hypomethekated.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG island is hypermethlated at cancer cells. DNA methelation is an altaernative mutation to silence tomor supprecer gene in cancer. occer frequency in tumor are 1) DNA methelation in mitolically, 2) epimutations are rapidaly selected. Hypermethylation of ICR, Igf2 are over expression in wilms tumor. imprintig region in normal cells is methlated to silence enhancer resion ( act to Igf2 in paternal allele ), in cancer cells H19 are methylated ( patarnal and matarnal allele) then express doble of Igf2. CTCF bind insulter element to enhance H19. Igf2 associated with growth and promorting wilms tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>Decitabine and such epigenetic medicine funtion are similar. </span>The enzyme called EZH2 that attaches methyl groups to histone proteins, which are part of the chromosomal packaging. A lot of lymphomas—cancers of the immune system—are caused by mutations that make EZH2 overactive. Such overactivity methylates histones more than they should be and thus silences the genes they surround, including so-called tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. <span>it also reduces the proliferation of tumour cells while, crucially, having no apparent effect on nearby normal cells.</span><span>histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer.</span></span></p></div>
