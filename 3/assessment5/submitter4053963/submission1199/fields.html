    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele is methylated at the H19/lgf2 cluster whereas the maternal allele is unmethylated. Therefore, this cluster is paternally imprinted. Because the imprinted gene on the maternal allele is bound by the insulator protein CTCF, H19 is enhanced. Lgf2 cannot be enhanced as it is insulated by CTCF. However, since this is not the case at the paternal allele as the imprinted gene is not bound by CTCF, lgf2 is enhanced.</p>
<p>Imprinting at the H19/lgf2 cluster results in a loss of imprinting expression. There can be either expression from both parental alleles or silenced expression. What occurs in Wilm’s tumour is that with a loss of imprinting, the maternal allele will also express lgf2, instead on being silenced. This contributes to disease as the expression of another lgf2 contributes to the promotion of growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation of CpG islands is that they tend to be protected from methylation as it results in the silencing of gene expression. This is because they tend to be at the promoters of genes and are upstream to the transcription machinery. Therefore, they tend to be unmethylated. DNA methylation results in hypermethlylation at CpG islands disrupted by cancer. The CpG islands in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes can silence them, thus, preventing suppression.</p>
<p>Normally, intergenic regions and respective elements are methylated. This is in order to maintain genomic integrity/ stability. It functions to prevent transposition through the silencing or mutating repeats. It also silences repeats to prevent transcriptional interferences with strong promoters. Repeats are methylated to prevent illegitimate recombination.  DNA methylation results in hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements when disrupted by cancer. This can result illegitimate recombination between non-homologous sequences and areas of heterochromatin. It can result in activation, thereby making copies of itself and transposing itself throughout the genome. It can also activate cryptic promoters, disrupting neighbouring genes. This basically results in genomic instability which is a feature of the deletion of DNMT1 (in mice) and ICF (in humans).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA demethylating class of epigenetic inhibitor. Decitabine impacts DNA methylation by removing methyl groups from nucleotides in the DNA. This can have an anti-tumour effect as this inhibits the enzyme, EZH2. This enzyme attaches methyl groups to histone proteins. Lymphomas can cause EZH2 to become overactive, increasingly methylating histones. This results in gene silencing and affects tumour – suppressor genes. Therefore, Decitabine can have an anti – tumour effect as it would prevent hypermethlylation and decrease the proliferation of tumour cells, through histone demethylating.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation at can affect genomic imprinting. In terms of parent – of – origin specific inheritance, if the monoallelic gene expression is affected, it can spell trouble for subsequent descendants. A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming (the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks) and it is a period of development that is susceptible to environmental stimuli. The sensitive periods of development in terms of epigenetics are the pre –implantation period and the primordial germ cell development. It is inadvisable because at that period, the epigenetic markers are being erased and reset, any change you acted out would be removed before having an effect</p></div>
