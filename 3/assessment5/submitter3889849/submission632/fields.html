    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal Cells, the CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation because CpG Islands are associated with Gene Promoters, DNA methylation occurs is CpG islands because they are symmetric, so those epigenetic marks can be mitotically heritable and stable. This Marks are asocciated with gene silencing, because it  causes  repressive changes in the chromatin structure of a gene and it prevents transcription factors to bind and alters gene expression (e.g. X inactivation, Heterochromatin). In Cancer cells, promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated. Cancer is a Multifactorial disease, consequense of genetic and epigenetic mistakes, but often seen in tumors,  DNA hypermethylation of the CpG islands causes silencig in tumour suppressing genes.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in promoters of normal cells are usually unmethylated, but repetitive and intergenic regions elements tend to be methylated. The normal function for methyl groups in the intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity, to prevent deletions, insertions or translocations, this methylation of the intergenic regions is for silencing cryptic transcription start sites (non traditional promoters), which could result in transcriptional interference; another feature is to silence splice sites because these having a particular DNA  sequence  they can be recognized by the splicing mahcinery. In the case of repetitive elements when they're hypomethylated they copy or cut themselves and  jump out and paste in another region in the genome. In cancer these repetitive elements and intergenic regions are unmethylated. When this mecanism is disrupted in this elements causes mutagenic changes insulting the regulation in gene expression. </p>
<p>In general, cancer cells display changes in DNA methylation  with consecuences, genomic instability and deregulation of  genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is seen when certain genes are expressed in a parent of origin specific manner. These genes are not scattered throughout the genome, a chromosomal region that acts, in a methylation-sensitive way, to determine whether imprinted genes are expressed or not according to the parent from which the gene derived is called Imprinted Control Region (ICR).</p>
<p>The H19 or Igf2 cluster  found closely linked on human chromosome 11 is  controlled by enhancer blocking.</p>
<p>In the ICR of this cluster is methylated on the paternal alllele, the region has a regulated transcriptional insulator that binds CTCF, but if the ICR is Methylated CTCF will not bind to the ICR so  the enhancers will free to act on Igf2 promoting Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In te maternal Allele the ICR is unmethylated so CTCF es able to insulate Igf2 from the downstream gene enhancers, so these enhancers will be free to act on the H19 promoter to allow H19 to express.</p>
<p>This Mechanism is disrupted  due to hipermethylation of the ICR in the maternal allele, it will cause overexpression of Igf2 from both maternal and paternal allele.</p>
<p>Igf2 is associated with growth promoting causing wilm's tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA Drug approved that is a DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor, wich is a nucleoside analogue that incorporates to DNA upon replication, then the DNA methyltranferase binds that nucleotide to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase  bounds irreversible so no longer can be realeased, so this means that this is replication dependent.</p>
<p>Cancer cells divide faster than normal cellsso they  will be severely affected because they replicate more, these drug has a antineoplasic effect because it causes DNA demethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because these drugs are not selective they can alter the epigenome, so these alterations can be mitocally heritable for all cells,  they could actually change gene expression.</p>
<p>A sentive period is a  period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals, there are two mayor events of epigenetic reprogramming in development, in early development (zigote to blastocyst) and  Primordial Germ Cell and Germ Cell development.</p>
<p>These drugs that affect DNA methylation have the potential to affect every cell; e.g.  in younger patients  that have developing germ cells,the use of these drugs could resulto into a large insult in a sensitive period that  could lead to inhibit the epigenetic machinery.</p></div>
