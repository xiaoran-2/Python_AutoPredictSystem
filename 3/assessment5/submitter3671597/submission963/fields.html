    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually unmethylated as methylation at these islands is thought to cause suppression of a gene which needs to be expressed. Methylation at any CpG island usually correlates to gene silencing.</p>
<p>During cancer CpG islands become hypermethylated or they are more likely to be methylated even if not all are methylated. This usually occurs in the promoter region of tumour suppressor genes. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable therefore will pass from cell to cell easily. A tumour suppressor gene is very important in controlling cell growth and once it is silenced this is no longer possible hence the cells are able to grow out of control and become immortal.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation works by preventing the binding of certain sequence specific proteins or binding proteins that interfere with transcription. These changes have not only been observed in cancers but in other illnesses such as hypertension and kidney disease where methylation of CpG islands has led to low expression of key enzymes required for the correct functioning of these cell lines.</p>
<p>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in a normal cell. This is important for maintaining genomic integrity through silence cryptic transcription start sites; silencing of repeats to avoid interference of strong promoters; prevention of transposition and prevention of illegitimate combination.</p>
<p>In cancer cells there is a global hypomethylated of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. The result of hypomethylation depends on the cell type in which it is found. However, it may lead to instability in the genome due to illegitimate recombination between repeats.  Hypomethylation leads to the chromosomes not being densely packed into heterochromatin. The repeats may also become activated resulting in them being transposed. This may lead to disruption or activation of genes in which the transposition occurs. Deletions or insertions may also occur.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele has the imprint control region (ICR) being methylated, it is paternally imprinted. The methylation of ICR and the H19 cluster.This results in the Igf2 being expressed form the paternal chromosome as the enhancers are able to bind to it and not to H19 which is now silent.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated resulting in the binding of CTCF. H19 is also unmethylated and the enhancers will bind to H19 resulting in its expression while Igf2 remains unexpressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor there is a loss of paternal imprinting. The maternal allele becomes methylated both at the ICR and H19 resulting in Igf2 now being expressed from the maternal allele as the enhancers now bind to Igf2 not H19. Igf2 is expressed from both maternal and paternal chromosomes, it is overexpressed.  </p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is related to other diseases such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome where loss of H19 activity results from hypermethylationg of ICR. Since Igf2 is growth promoting and H19 is growth suppressing an increase in H19 will cause increased risk of tumours. Loss of Igf2 function and increase H19 can lead to poor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It results in the hypomethylation of DNA. It inhibits DNA methyl transferase (DMT), the enzyme responsible for DNA methylation and ensuring that it is mitotically heritable, by binding it irreverislbly.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at CpG islands has been seen to silence tumour suppressor genes which are important in the control of growth. By preventing the methylation of these regions this could lead to the demethylation of the CpG islands and thus activation of tumour suppressors.  This results in the cell being able to have better control over growth</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is important in gene silencing and chromosome remodeling thus allowing sections of the genome to be open as in euchromatin. By irreversibly altering the structure of chromatin these changes will be passed on mitotically. Therefore once the epigenome is altered the new cell formed from division of the cancer cells will retain the modification. This will allow the chemotherapy drugs will be able to access the genome more readily as the alterations are retained</p>
<p>At different stages in development epigenetic marks are erased and reestablished (reprogramming). These periods in which epigenetic marks are being established are referred to as the sensitive period. These periods include primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development</p>
<p>Treating parent during these sensitive stages may result in effects on the future generation as a woman is pregnant or may become pregnant will have a foetus in early embryonic development and the epigenetic marks which need to be established for the correct functioning of differentiated cells will not occur. Also in males reprogramming of the sperm cells is very important to allow for the establishment of the correct marks in the progeny such as genomic imprinting. </p></div>
