    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells are not methylated CpG islands, the CpG methylated is related with inactivation of X chromosome in dosage compensation mechanism in mamals, specific in female and males. The normal methylated is to keep the stability, in condense the cromatin and blocking transcription factors binding by alter genes expression; normally about 60% CpG islands have been found unmethylated; DNA methylation is necessary by imprinting, X- inactivation or formation of heterochromatin; in addition DNA methylation has been associate inversely with gene expression as regulators of genes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DNA methylated in intergenic regions to maintain genomic integrity in normal cell to genomic stability and maybe to avoid interference in the transcription machinery to silence cryptic transcription start sities or cryptic splices sites. In the case of repetitive regions elements serves to prevent transpositions because DNA methylated is mutagenic and it have protect the genome, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and avoid illegitimate recombination. Features in cancers cell has been associated with intergenics regions and repetitive element unmethylated and CpG islands hypermethylated to produce reciprocal translocations, deletions, insertions, duplications and lost of chromosomes causing genomic instability. Hypermethyation of CpG islands act to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer but this is accompanied by multiple changes for example activate several oncogenes, which is very common in tumors and CpG island methylated increases over time, how has been in classes examples of simple hypermethylated genes: RB, MLH1, BRCA1 and MGMT but also there are cancer have CpG methylated island relation with groups of genes like gliomas, colorecytal cancer, neuroblastoma, etc. CpG hypermetylated help to diagnostic cancer are associated to diagnostics different diseases and can be used to monitor different kind os tumours.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells are methylated at Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs) in paternal allele and maternal allele is unmethylated and CTCF binding in ICRs in this allele by enhancers active H19 gene and Igf2 gene in maternal allele is silence and don’t be expression but as is methylated ICR and CTCF can’t be join in this site, in paternal allele, the enhancers active Igf2 in paternal allele to express this gene. But when loss imprinting in maternal allele because is hypermethylated in both alIeles at ICRs and intergenetics sites in H19 and Ifg2 is express in maternal allele and paternal allele too, there is double dose of Igf2 resulting Wilm’s tumour, it can be said that there is a hypermethylated events in early stage in tumourgenesis to produce in cancer. Respect to hypomethyleted genome wide and it is depends where is the location. If is in repeats regions or CpG poor promoters to activations oncogenes generating an instability genomic to produce human diseases like a human cancers. (Blewitt, 2013)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There is hope to treatments with epigenetics drugs, that interact in involved at specific sort of genes regulation in rare illness cancer and others, one these drugs is Decitabine is one of them DNA-demethylating agent are used to treat myelodyspastic syndromes (leukemia).</p>
<p>Decitabine act in DNMTi en histones proteins when are hypermethylated sites in methyl groups  because when there are cells cancer have H3 are methylated like H3K9me and H3k27me are hypermethylated to block of genes and silencing genes but the mechanism in action is unclear yet but they have been that stop the growth of cancer cells in solid tumours. Decitabine act in low dose in DNA methylation and it have good responds becaouse in high dose is toxic . Decitabine is dependent of cells replication because in cells cancers they are divided very fast and have effect, maybe DNMT inhibitors act in CpG island hypermethylated and patient whit this respond very well to the DNMT inhibitors like Decitabine (the guardian, 2011; Blewitt, 2013)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetics drugs are act in epigenetic machinery in transcription factors in fact act in enzymatic epigenetic regulators, like: TET, DNMT, HDAC, HMTs, HAT, HDM, Chromatin remodellers and theirs small molecules; epigenetic drugs act in active site of enzymatic epigenetic regulators ATP dependent modulating changes in chromatin, can controlled cell division. Histones modification are very dynamic and polycomb group (PcG) proteins are essential to maintain the cellular memory and it important  regulating gene expression patterns in response to extrinsic signals like epigenetics drugs but DNA methylation depend on tumor type and stage of disease and the epigenetic drugs depends their target genes in the tissue type of origin of cancer. Sensitive period could be younger patients, germ cells, blastocyst, primordial germ cells, gametes, fertilised egg gestation pregnancy when PGCs of embryos developing, embryogenesis- gametogenesis (gametes, fertilised egg, blatocyst, epiblast). Sensitive period could be the stage where there is a major change or flexibility by any external factor for gene expression and depending on the type of cell, tissue and age.
