    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of CpG islands is usually associated with inhibition of gene expression.  CpG islands, which are found in the promoter regions of genes, are usually unmethylated.  Cancer cells are more likely to have increased methylation at CpG islands, which is known as CGI hypermethylation.  CGI hypermethylation could result in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes.  DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable.  The cells resulting from subsequent cell divisions will also have CGI hypermethylation, which combined with other insults, such as the activation of oncogenes, can lead to increased cell division and decreased cell death, resulting in tumor formation.</p>
<p>In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the genome are methylated in order to keep the genome stable and to reduce their expression by causing these regions to be more densely packed as heterochromatin.  In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated.  Hypomethylation would cause these regions to be more open in structure like euchromatin, and thus more accessible for transcription and subsequent expression.  Hypomethylated intergenic regions can lead to transcriptional interference between neighboring genes and improper chromosome deletions, insertions and duplications. Repetitive element expression can lead to production of more copies of repetitive elements, transcriptional interference, incorrect recombination between repeats, and the random insertion of repetitive elements into genes, all of which would lead to improper gene expression and genomic instability. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele.  The insulator protein, CTCF, is only able to bind to the imprint control region (ICR) when it is unmethylated.  As a result, CTCF does not bind to the ICR, allowing downstream enhancers to act on Igf2 on the paternal allele.  The H19/Igf2 ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele, which leads to the production of H19 long noncoding RNA.  In the unmethylated state, CTCF binds to the ICR.  Enhancers downstream from the H19 preferentially act on Igf2, but due to CTCF binding to the ICR, the enhancers will act on H19 on the maternal allele instead and promote H19 expression.  Loss of imprinting occurs on the maternal chromosome at the H19/Igf2 cluster in Wilm’s tumour.  As a result, both the maternal and paternal alleles are methylated.  CTCF is no longer able to bind which allows the downstream enhancers to act on Igf2, leading to biallelic expression of Igf2 and reduced expression of H19.  Igf2 is an oncogene, so too much Igf2 will bring about increased cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that is used for treating myelodysplastic syndromes, which lead to acute myelogenous leukemia.  Decitabine is able to integrate itself into DNA during replication and irreversibly binds to DNA methyltransferase, inhibiting its activity and ultimately leading to DNA demethylation in actively dividing cells, both normal and cancerous.  However, normal cells won’t be as negatively impacted because normal cells do not grow and divide as rapidly as cancer cells.  Because Decitabine potentially affects all cells, Decitabine is effective at lower dosages; high levels of the drug are toxic.  It’s possible that the mechanism that causes myelodysplastic syndromes involves hypermethylation of CpG islands.  The rapid growth of cancer cells is partly due to the hypermethylation of CpG islands of certain genes.  Removing methylation at the CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes could lead to normal expression of these genes and subsequently cause cell death.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable; changes in DNA methylation caused by epigenetic drugs will be passed down to subsequent generations of cells until those changes are actively removed.  A sensitive period is any developmental stage that has increased sensitivity to signals from the environment.  Organisms are most susceptible to DNA methylation changes during periods of high epigenetic reprogramming such as primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development.  Treating patients during sensitive periods (e.g. child patients) could potentially result in permanent changes in their epigenome, which would lead to alterations in gene expression that could negatively affect their development and/or overall health.  It’s possible that these epigenetic changes can be passed down to future generations (e.g. children, grandchildren), and these changes could impact their health as well.  Studies in rats showed that maternal nurturing behavior can permanently alter the methylation state in the glucocorticoid receptor gene of rat pups. Human studies such as the Dutch Famine and Overkalix studies demonstrated the possibility of transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic changes.  The long-term effects of epigenetic alterations must be considered when determining the course of treatment of patients using epigenetic drugs.</p></div>
