    <div class="field-value"><p>"DNA methylation is a biochemical process involving the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine or adenine DNA nucleotide. DNA methylation is essential for normal development and is associated with a number of key processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosomes inactivation, suppression of repetitive elements, and carcinogenesis. DNA methylation typically occurs in a CpG dinucleotide context". CpGs are highly methylated in mammals. CpG Islands are found in the promoters of a tumor suppressor gene! In cancer, gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hyper-methylation, which results in transciptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. Such alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as an important component of cancer development. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, in a normal cell, the CpG islands are more likely hypo-methylated, whereas the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are both generally hyper-methylated. In contrast, in cancer cell, the CpG Islands are more likely to be methylated and the rest of the genome, including the repetitive elements and the intergenic regions as well, hypo-methylated.</p>
<p>Hypo-methylation in repeats and intergenic region is linked to <strong>chromosomal instability, </strong>the hetero-chromatin being no longer closely packaged and aberrant recombination can occur, <strong>and loss of imprinting, </strong>the repeats can jump into or activate neighboring gene, whereas hyper-methylation is associated mainly with promoters. Both hyper and hypo-methylation processes vary by tumour type and progress along with the disease expansion.</p>
<p>More rare cases of CpG island <strong>poor promoter</strong> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hypo</span>-methylation have been reported, leading to the activation of oncogene for example.</p>
<p>The hyper-methylation phenomenon is also observed when people age... </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation (hypo or hyper) at imprint control regions can result in loss of expression of <strong>growth</strong> restricting gene or overexpression of <strong>growth</strong> promoting genes, e.g. hyper-methylation of ICR, IGF2 (which encodes the insulin-like growth factor II) over-expression in Wilm’s tumour.</p>
<p>The CTCF imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele and un-methylated on the maternal allele. This situation leads to the activation of the H19 gene expression on the latter (whereas IGF2 is silenced) and of the IGF2 gene expression on the former or paternal.</p>
<p>The loss of imprinting of the IGF2 gene is the most common epigenetic alteration in Wilm’s tumour. Loss of imprinting involves aberrant activation of the normally repressed maternally inherited allele, leading to the double-dose-expression of IGF2, which is growth promoting!</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine</strong> is a drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, a class of conditions where certain blood cells are dysfunctional, and for acute myeloid leukemia.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p>More specifically, Decitabine act as a <strong>DNA methyltransferase inhibitor</strong> and has shown substantial potency in <strong>reactivating epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes</strong> in vitro. However, it has been difficult to define the mode of action of these drugs in patients and it appears that clinical responses are influenced both by epigenetic alterations and by apoptosis induction. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>"DNA methylation is essential for normal development and is associated with a number of key processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, suppression of repetitive elements, and carcinogenesis. In consequence, altering this essential process can lead to dramatic consequences".</p>
<p>« Unlike others of gene regulation, epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. <strong>It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can affect changes which stop a cancer growing without to kill all its cells </strong>». </p>
<p>Furthermore, every cell can potentially be affected by epigenetic therapies like DNA methyltransferase or Histones methyltransferase inhibitors. Thus, their potential side effects must be considered particularly during the very <strong>sensitive period</strong> of epigenetic reprogramming, the embryogenesis and primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>Having in mind that the oocytes of a young patient suffering from a cancer or a disease linked to the epigenome won’t be matured before her adolescence, we have to be particularly cautious when treating them.</p></div>
