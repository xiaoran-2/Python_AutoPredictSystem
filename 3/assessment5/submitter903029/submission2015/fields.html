    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The <span> methylation pattern of the paternal allele at the ICR Blocks the CTCF enhancer , the <span>H19 promoter is silenced and Igf2 is activated. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The methylation pattern of the maternal allele, CTCF binds and insulates Igf2 silencing it, and enhances H19, a lncRNA .</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In Wilm’s tumour, loss of Cdkn1c growth suppressor (normally on mother's imprinted allele ) and upregulation of Igf2, bothact as a growth enhancer to cause tumors.   Double whammy. Two alleles acting like paternal allele. This can happen with paternal disomy also.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>Decitabine is a</span> DNA-demethylating, a DNMTi agent, a nucleoside analogue . O<span>ver methylation of histones silences the genes they surround, including tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that  results in tumors. Decitabine causes hypomethyelation, and its inorporation into DNA, inhibits DNA synthesis and causes cell death. It works only  in dividing cells, and cancer cell hallmark is to be rapidly dividing. </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span> Sensitive periods of development are during germ cell development. If treatment occurred at these times the changes would be passed on to future generations. </span></p>
<p>If a pharmaceutical causes DNA methylation changes in somatic cells by a ‘‘direct” effect, it might also target the same<br />pathway in germ line cells. Or it might interfere in an ‘‘indirect’ way with a receptor common to both types of cell. It could target any mechanism which inﬂuences the pattern of DNA methylation or chromatin architecture in a particular region of the genome. In this way, the methylation of the same DNA sequence would be altered in somatic cells to produce a side-effect, and in germ line cells of the developing fetus to produce the same or a similar change in DNA methylation. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin</span> Long-range silencing of repetitive sequences and formation of silent heterochromatin but also DNA access for transcription in euchromatin or DNA replication are dependent on DNA methylation </span></p>
<p><span><span>CpG islands are found in about 60% of promoters</span><span>. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state.I</span><span>n cancer cells, promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene</span><span>. Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA</span><span>. </span></span></p>
<p>In cancer, changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes that control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands.</p></div>
