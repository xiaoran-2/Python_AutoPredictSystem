    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Overall, in normal cells there is a higher degree of methylation and lower degree of methylation in the CpG islands over time, whereas in cancerous cells there is an overall lower degree of methylation and higher degree of methylation at the CpG islands over time. In normal cells, the DNA in the CpG islands are not methylated and methylated at the gene; specifically introns, the intergenic region and repetitive elements. In cancerous cells, the DNA in the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated and not methylated at the gene; specifically introns, the intergenic region and repetitive elements. More commonly repetitive elements are hypomethylated in tumoric cells. The hypermethyated CpG islands silence the tumor suppressors resulting in uncontrollable growth only when coupled with other factors that cause cancer such as both alleles of tumor suppressors are silenced. The above mentioned hypermethylation of the CpG islands characteristic to cancer can be found in a single gene or a panel of genes (CIMP). Recently, it has also been discovered that are 2 kbp upstream and downstream to the CpG islands can be hypermethylated in cancerous cells further classifying these as tumoric cells. Different tumor types have different silencing patterns; in other words they have different hypermethylation patterns. Hypomethylation of the repetitive elements, leads to cancer due to instability of the genome because hypomethylation results in less condensed packaging of the genome or euchromatin leading to illegitimate crossing over during meiosis. CpG poor promoter region, on the other hand, can lead to cancer by activating oncogenes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint control regions are important because methylated or non-methylated ICRs will determine whether maternal or paternal genes will be expressed in their progeny. Hypomethylation or hypermethylation of the ICRs can lead to cancer. For example, if a normal cell has a hypermethylated paternal ICR and an unmethylated maternal ICR, the H19 gene on the maternal allele will be expressed by the enhancers, but expression of Igf2 will be blocked because CTCF will bind to the unmethylated ICR. The reverse will occur on the paternal allele; methylation of the H19 gene will block its expression, but the methylated ICR will allow the direct expression of the Igf2 gene by the enhancers. However, hypermethylation leads to loss of imprinting and methylation occurs on both maternal and paternal allele, resulting in double expression of Igf2 and no expression of the H19 gene. Since Igf2 is a growth promoter, double expression of it leads to Wilm's tumour.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a DNA-demethylating or hypomethylating agent, sold as Dacogen, is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, which is the precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia.  Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting methyltransferase; the enzyme involved in methylating DNA. Methylating DNA is a type of epigenetic marker that goes awry in cancer. Unregulated methylation leads to uncontrolled growth and makes cells more prone to become cancerous. Drugs such as Decitabine, which are responsible for inhibiting methyltransferase and therefore hypomethylating DNA can correct this error.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a form of epigenetic mark and is passed on through generations. Epigenetics control the level of gene expression, which is important for normal cell functioning and in turn normal organism functioning. Every type of cell has a different function and therefore every cell type has a different set of epigenetic marks. Since every cell has different functions and needs a different set of epigenetic marks, there are sensitive periods during which reprogramming of epigenetic marks occur. There are two periods during which epigenetic reprogramming occurs and these are during production of germ cells and during early development. Treating a patient before epigenetic marks are set, may not give the results that are predicted and may have an effect on epigenetic marks for future generations.</p></div>
