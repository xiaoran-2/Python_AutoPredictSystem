    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is alterd in cancer in a locus-specific and genome-wide fashion. In cancer, there is CpG islands hypermethylation and hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Ususally, in a normal cell CpG islands are protected from methylation and when the methylation does occur at CpG islands, it leads to silencing of gene expression. In conclusion, when methylation occurs at a CpG island that is, for example, a part of a tumor suppressor gene promoter, it silences that particular tumor supressor gene and disables the transcription of its product, which all can, in addition to other epigenetic and/or genetic alterations, lead to development of cancer. On the other hand, in a healthy cell repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated in order to maintain genomic integrity and stability. Since repetitive elements are able to "copy/cut and paste" themselves to other parts of the genome and, thus, cause, deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions, they are normally hypermethylated and silenced. When the repeats are hypomethylated, transpositions occur, which disrupts the function of genes at the insertion site of the repetitive element. This results in transcriptional interference, whether the repeat acts as a strong promoter and causes the transcription of downstream genes, or it disrupts the normal trancription process. If the strong promoter is inserted nearby an oncogene, it my be one of the hits that lead to cancer. In a similar way, if it disrupts the trancription of a tumor supressor gene, or alters the tumor supressor gene product due to repeatitive element insertion, this may also result in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 is a cluster of genes whose expression is controled by parentally imprinted control region. Since this imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal chromosome, an insulator protein CTCF cannot bind to it. Methylation of the ICR on the paternal chromosome is additionally spread to a promoter region of the H19 gene which is consistent with its silencing. Silenced H19 gene is unable to bind downstream enhancers, which instead bind to Igf2 gene and promote its transcription. Methylation on the maternal chromosome is exactly opposite. ICR region is unmethylated and therefore CTCF protein is able to bind to it. This protein insulates the Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers, which are now attracted to unmethylated and active H19 gene. Therefore, there is no transcription of Igf2 from the maternal chromosome. Igf2 is an oncogene, thus its expression from both the maternal and paternal chromosomes promotes growth and oncogenesis which is exactly what happens in development of Wilm's tumor. This expression can occur due to uniparental paternal disomy, mutation or deletion of the ICR, or epigenetic disruption. Mutation/deletion and epigenetic disruption  of the ICR both result in loss of imprinting and overproduction of Igf2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabin inhibits DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and, thus, cellular differentiation or apoptosis. When DNA methyltransferase is inhibited, there is a dilution of methylation with each cell division, which disables inheritance of epigenetic marks in daughter cells, and once those epigenetic marks are lost, they don't return. In instances in which methylation of particular genes leads to oncogenesis, inhibition of DNA methyltransferase is useful since methylation in daugter cells is disrupted and oncogenic epigenetic marks are not passed on with every subsequent cell division. This probably leads to cell death or even maturation of tumor cells, which could at least make them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy, if not eradicate them.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Activity of DNA methyltransferase 1 ensures that epigenetic marks are passed on with each cell division, therefore those marks are mitotically heretable and have enduring effects on the epigenome. Epigenetically sensitive period is a time when epigenetic marks are being reprogrammed, and when altered environment can have an effect on epigenetic control and therefore on the epigenetic makeup of the cell. In human life sensitive periods are , generally speaking, early embriogenesis (preimplantation when epigenetic marks are removed and early postimplantation period when they are actively reprogrammed), development of primordial germ cells and maturation of germ cells (for example, oocytes undergo their final development stages during puberty). In fact, every tissue has its own sensitive period, because tissues differentiate at diferent time during human development, but periods when the consequences of altered epigenetic control are most readily observed and have the greatest impact on the organism as a whole, are those mentioned above. During sensitive periods it would be inadvisable to use drugs that affect DNA methylation, since it would permanently alter epigenetic makeup in developing cells/tissues, which could lead to cancer/disease in later life or even in offspring (exposure during primordial germ cells development).</p></div>
