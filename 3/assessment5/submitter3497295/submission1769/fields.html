    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell Cpg islands are not methylated, or hypomethylated, and tumour suppressor genes are not silenced; in a cancer cell CpG islands are more methylated, or hypermethylated and this silenced tumour supressor genes. Hypermthylation increase with tumorigenicity. </p>
<p>In a normall cell intergenic regions and repetitive elements ara methylated and in a cancer cell they are not methylated. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CTFC 4 bind is methylated on the paternal  allele, and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it's unmethylated CTCF 4 bind is insulator element, and it means that the enhancers in this case will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal  allele, so we don't see expression. On the paternal allele, because this is methylated, the enhancers can act on IGF2, because CTCF is not binding to intulate this, and IGF2 is expressed from the pattern allele. However, with loss of imprinting and what happened is you have high permethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well.</p>
<p>On Wilm’s tumour the maternal allele, you also have expression of Igf2. So now you have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to what you saw in a normal cell. And Igf2 is both growth promoting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p><span>Decitabine is a hypom</span>ethylatingagent.<span>It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</span></p></div>
