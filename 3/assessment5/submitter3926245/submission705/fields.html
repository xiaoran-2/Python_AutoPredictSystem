    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a chemical modification that occurs essentially in position 5 of cytosines that are next to guanines. These di-nucleotides (nt) are called CpG. Zones where CpG are found frequently in an DNA sequence greater than 200nt are known as CpG islands. CpG islands are found frequently in promoter regions in an unmethylated state, allowing that transcriptional factors (TF) and transcriptional machinery (TM) perform their function. However it has been observed that in cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated, so these interfere with TF and TM causing repression of the gene downstream. As CpG hypermethylation (CpGhy) is altering gene expression, it has been associated with diseases. Specifically in the case of cancer CpGhy is repressing tumor suppressor genes so the cell cycle is going on and on, given rise to tumor growth. </p>
<p>Furthermore DNA methylation is established in other regions of the genome, for example intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In an healthy subject methylation of intergenic regions can avoid the transcription of non coding RNA (ncRNA). ncRNA is not translated into proteins, but instead can interact with mRNA, proteins and DNA to regulate gene expression. If DNA methylation is disrupted in these sites, gene expression of those genes who are target of ncRNA can be altered. As a consequence of these normal function of the cell can be loss and initiate a disease phenotype. That is the case in cancer cells where it is observed an overexpression of an long-ncRNA called HOTAIR and  other called ANRIL. The latter one is an regulator of the cell cycle in normal cells.</p>
<p>Finally DNA methylation in repetitive elements is establish to maintain genomic stability in an normal state. In some diseases like cancer exist an hypomethylation of these areas causing gain, loss, transposition of DNA sequences (genomic instability).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that promotes demethylation of DNA. This agent inhibits the function of DNA-methyl transferases (DNMT's) because its structure is analog to cytosine. Its effect on the epigenome can serve as an anti-tumor drug mainly in two ways.</p>
<p>In one hand when inhibiting DNMT of maintenance decitabine can "erase" in passive form the altered DNA methylation present in tumor cells. It also can occur in normal cells but as the tumor cells are constantly in proliferation, are more susceptible to be "re-programed" with the drug. On the other hand when inhibiting <em>de novo</em> DNMT's can prevent the establishment of new DNA methylation, allowing the cell to maintain their characteristic epigenetic marks avoiding the establishment of new aberrant DNA methylation.</p>
<p>These drug should be use in tumors that are driven by tumor suppressor hypermethylation because DNA methylation is also necessary for genomic stability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The fact that some epigenetic mechanisms can be inherited is intriguing. One of these modifications is DNA methylation which is maintained in DNA replication. It means that if we could alter in an specific-manner the epigenome in one cell, all the ones derived from it would have the same DNA methylation.</p>
<p>Because in cancer exists alterations in DNA methylation patterns and these could be heritable, one way to proceed in the treatment is trying to re-establish the normal methylation patterns. However now a days it is not possible to direct the epigenetic modification that are seen with some drugs to specific genes/sequences. For this reason these kind of drug shouldn't be use in period where exist an epigenetic programing (called sensitive periods). As drugs perform their activity in a global manner we could modificate some other marks that are essential to maintain the normal function of the cell. These sensitive periods are after the fecundation and in the maturation of germ line. In the first case the use of the drug could affect directly the epigenetic program of the newborn. In the second case we could affect the grandsons of the mother expose.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 gene is only express from the paternal allele due to hypermethylation of a sequence belonging to imprinted control regions (ICR). This prevents the binding of a protein that only interact with no-methylated DNA called CTCF. CTCF function as a insulator for enhancers that are downstream of Igf2 and H19 gene. So if CTCF is absent (because ICR is hypermethylated) the enhancer can function on the Igf2. That's what happens with the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Instead, in the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated leading to the binding of CTCF, avoiding in this way the interaction between the Igf2 gene and the enhancers. As the H19 gene is downstream of Igf2 and ICR but upstream of the enhancers, these latter act on the H19 gene. So the H19 is only express from the maternal allele because in the paternal it is hypermethylated.</p>
<p>The loss of imprinting in these cluster (hypermethylation in both alleles) can promotes development of diseases because exists an altered expression of genes where there is an over-expression of Igf2 and silencing of H19 at the same time. These process is observed in Wilm's tumor. In these cancer the overdose of Igf2 facilitates tumor growth.</p></div>
