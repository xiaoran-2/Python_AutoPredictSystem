    <h1>Submission 1268 from Anon (session_user_id: 00d63634a562e4428bf5898b72d8792c656517bf)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi) which can be used to demethylate hypermethylated tumor suppressor genes which are inappropriately silenced in cancer patients.  Decitabine is an analog of cytosine and can incorporate into DNA.  DNMT binds to the analog and can not lay down the methyl group and thus when DNA replicates, the methylation mark is lost.  This drug can have an anti-tumor effect in MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome) patients by removing methylation marks in the hypermethylated, silenced tumor-suppressor gene rendering it active to perform its function of controlling cell growth, signalling DNA repair, or apoptosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are passed on to daughter cells when DNA replicates so when a cancer drug removes a DNA methylation mark, if that cell goes on to replicate and divide, the two daughter cells will no longer carry that methylation mark and so that loss of methylation will be perpetuated by the daughters of those two cells and so on.  There are two sensitive periods when epigenetic marks are erased and are reprogrammed.  These are during germ cell development and early embryonic, pre-implantation development.  These are sensitive periods because epigenetic marks are being removed and are being re-established for the lifetime of the organism.  It would be inadvisable to treat patients (woment who are or may be pregnant, for example) during these periods due to disruption of normal epigenetic marks that are crucial for proper gene regulation across the entire genome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands found in promoters are hypomethylated, but in cancer cells, they tend to be hypermethylated, causing gene silencing.  If a CpG island found in the promoter of a tumor-suppressor gene is hypermethylated so that the gene is silenced, uncontrolled cell growth, failure of apoptosis, or failure of DNA repair can result, causing disease, including cancer.</p>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated.  This silences transposons and non-coding DNA which helps prevent chomrosome instability. In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated and can cause activation of transposons, activation of cryptic promotors (epigenetically silenced promoters, or typically inactive promoters) and genomic instability due to insertions, deletions, reciprocal translocations, and improper recombination within repeats.  These can lead to disease, including cancer.  For example, when an oncogene that is normally silenced is activated by loss of methylation, its expression can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation, leading to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is mono-allelic, parent-of-origin specific, epigentic regulation of gene expression.  It is important to retain epigenetic marks to control expression so that only one allele is expressed.  For example, normally on the paternal allele in the H19/Igf2 cluster, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated, blocking CTCF (an insulator protein serving to block enhancers) and in addition, the methylation spreads to H19 promoter, silencing H19 expression and allows the enhancers to act on Igf2 which is expressed.  Normally, on the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, thereby allowing CTCF to bind, blocking the enhancers to act on Igf2 and instead act on H19 which is expressed.  So, normally, Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele and H19 is expressed from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele can be methylated at the H19 allele causing it to behave like the paternal allele.  When this happens, there is overexpression of Igf2 and less expression of H19. Igf2 codes for a fetal growth factor and overexpression of this can cause fetal and post-natal overgrowth, macroglasia, and embyronic and childhood tumors.</p></div>
