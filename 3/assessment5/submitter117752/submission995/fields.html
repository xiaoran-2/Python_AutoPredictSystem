    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often at the promoter of genes and usually unmethylated but when methylated will lead to the silencing of genes.  Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in DNA are normally methylated to preserve genomic stability.  In cancer, the areas of methylation are reversed.  CpG islands become hypermethylated and the associated genes being silenced are usually tumour suppression genes which do things like control cell cycle, apoptois, and DNA repair.  The intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated and this can lead to translocations and illegitimate recombinations between repeats and the activation of repeats.  The translocations can disrupt or promote neighbouring genes.  The reversed pattern of methylation in CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to a cell that no longer functions normally.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele but not on the maternal allele, hence imprinting is on the paternal chromosome.  The CTCF protein binds to the unmethylated maternal ICR and insulates Igf2 from downnstream enhancers which are then free to act on H19.  On the paternal allele, without CTCF, methylation spreads to H19 and silences it.  The downstream enhancers can then activate Igf2 on the paternal allele.</p>
<p>The disruption of impriniting, in the case of Wilm's tumour, results in the methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele which now acts like the paternal allele and promotes Igf2.  Igf2 is a growth promoter and with both the paternal and maternal allele producing it, there is twice the normal amount which results in Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome characterized by fetal or post-natal overgrowth,macroglossia (enlarged tongue), and a predisposition to embryonic or childhood tumours like Wilm's (kidney) tumour but not adult tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belong to the class of epigenetic drugs knows as DNA-demethylating agents as such they remove methylation on DNA.  Decitabine could remove the methylation from hypermethylated CpG islands which could then reactivate tumour suppression genes.  In a case like Wilm's tumour, the ICR of the maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster could become demethylated allowing CTCF to bind to it and thus reduce the amount of Igf2 being produced.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on in cell division to all future generations until they are erased.  Drugs that alter DNA methylation are no different from normal epigenetic changes and these alterations will also be passed onto future generations.  A sensitive period is when the epigenome is most vulnerable to environmental changes.  This occurs during the extensive epigenetic reprogramming periods such as early embryonic development and primordial germ cell (PGC) development.  During PGC development, imprint genes are reprogrammed as well.  Altering DNA methylation at this point could lead to embryonic tumors and other epigenetic diseases like Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, Angelman syndrome, or Prader-Willi syndrome.  Furthermore, female germ cells remain in a demethylated state until puberty so any alterations to DNA methylation will have consequences for future generations.  Thus it is inadvisable to treat patients with DNA methylation alteration drugs during ovulation if they are trying to conceive, pregnancy as it can alter germ cells in the fetus, and young females before puberty.</p></div>
