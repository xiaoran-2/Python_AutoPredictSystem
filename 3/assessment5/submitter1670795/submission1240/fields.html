    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Appropriate (tissue-specific) patterns of DNA methylation are essential for normal gene expression and for controlling cell replication.  Cancer cells have abnormal patterns of DNA methylation –  hypomethylation of the genome as a whole, but hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores (2-kb regions adjacent to the islands).</p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In normal cells, CpG islands are mostly not methylated, and the associated genes can be expressed. Hypermethylation of CpG islands causes silencing of the associated genes. In cancers, silenced genes typically include multiple tumor suppressors that regulate the cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair, allowing cells that have acquired other genetic and epigenetic abnormalities to escape from the mechanisms that would normally prevent the cells' replication.</p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Hypomethelation of genomic regions outside CpG islands can also disrupt normal cell functioning and lead to cancer. In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are mostly methylated, and this is important for genomic stability. Hypomethylation of intergenic intervals and repetitive elements can produce genomic instability through copy-number alterations, deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. If strong promoters associated with repeats become activated through hypomethylation, expression of other nearby genes may also be affected, producing additional abnormalities. Hypomethylation of certain CpG-poor promoters can contribute to cancer by activating oncogenes.</p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Hypermethylation of CpG islands and genome-wide hypomethylation are found in all types of cancer, but the particular genes and intergenic regions showing abnormal methylation vary by tumor type. Thus genome-wide analysis of methylation patterns can help with diagnosis and can also aid in establishing the stage of disease (hypermethylation of CpG islands increases as disease progresses, as does genome-wide hypomethylation). In some cases the detailed methylation pattern can identify individuals with good or poor prognosis, and the pattern may also help in determining therapy and monitoring its success.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogue that can be incorporated into DNA. When that occurs, DNMT binds irreversibly to DNA, and less DNMT is available to methylate the hemi-methylated DNA produced during mitosis. With Decitabine present, DNA becomes progressively less methylated as cells continue dividing.</p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Cancer cells typically show hypomethylation of the genome as a whole, but with hypermethylation at CpG islands; the latter leads to abnormal silencing of tumor-suppressor genes. Decitabine potentially can have an anti-tumor effect by demethylating and thus restoring expression of abnormally silenced tumor suppressors. Whether patients will be helped by Decitabine depends on the type of tumor, and on its stage. In fact, Decitabine helps most patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, but the drug might cause harm in some types of cancer by demethylating intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which can contribute to genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"> </p>
<p>Azacitidine (like Decitabine), produces hypomethylation of DNA as cells divide. Even those patients whose tumors did not obviously respond during the clinical trial would have ended the trial with tumor cells that were substantially less methylated than before treatment. The altered level and pattern of methylation will persist after the trial, since the less-methylated tumor cells that developed during treatment will pass that pattern to their descendant cells. Thus, though is it impossible to guess beforehand what the response might be, it is plausible that the enduring epigenetic changes produced during drug treatment could alter patients' response to other lines of therapy.</p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"> </p>
<p>There are “sensitive periods” in mammals' development when extensive remodeling of methylation takes place– particularly during early embryonic development and development of primordial germ cells within mid-stage embryos. Azacitadine/Decitabine can disrupt normal completion of these processes, which are essential for normal development. Women should therefore avoid pregnancy while taking such drugs. Men should avoid fathering children during the drug's administration or for 3 mo. after, since these drugs can also disrupt normal spermatogenesis.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes have an imprint control region (ICR) that is methylated on the allele contributed by one parent only – this controls which parental allele is expressed. For example, the <em>H19/Igf2</em> gene cluster is paternally imprinted (the paternal ICR is methylated).  Normally, <em>Igf2</em> is expressed from the paternal allele only, while <em>H19</em> is expressed only from the maternal allele. The mechanism involves an insulator protein, CTCF, that binds to the unmethylated maternal ICR, which lies between<em> Igf2</em> and<em> H19</em>. CTCF insulates the maternal <em>Igf2</em> gene from downstream enhancers located on the <em>H19</em> side of the ICR; the enhancers instead boost expression of <em>H19</em>. On the paternal allele, methylation spreads from the ICR to <em>H19</em>, suppressing it. Methylation also prevents CTCF from binding to the ICR, and the downstream enhancers can access and boost expression of <em>Igf2</em>.</p>
<p>Many patients with Wilms tumor show loss of <em>H19/Igf2</em> imprinting through methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele. When that happens, the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele, leading to loss of expression of <em>H19</em> (<em>H19</em> appears to be a tumor suppressor), and over-expression of <em>Igf2</em>, which is a growth promoter/oncogene whose over-expression can lead to cancer.</p></div>
