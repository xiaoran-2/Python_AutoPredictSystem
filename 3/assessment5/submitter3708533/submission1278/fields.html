    <div class="field-value"><p><span> DNA methylation is the process by which a methyl group is added to a cytosine or adenine, which are nucleotides. This process is mutagenic. When this happens, at the CpG island the gene becomes silenced and it is unable to express. For a normal cell DNA methylation is important because it helps the cell with the diferentiation process for the formation of different tissues and it also supresses the expression of unwanted and harmful genes like the retroviral. In a normal cell the CpG island are hypomethilated and the genome is methylated in the repetitive elements. When it comes to cancer the process is completely the opposite. This means that in a normal cell methylation will work supressing the tumor and in a cancer cell the hypermethylation will act as an inactivation of tumor suppresor genes and the activation of oncogenes. It is important to understand that DNA methylation is epigenetically heritable. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated, but its CpG island are usually unmethylated. Its function is to mantain genomic stability. in a cancer cell this stanility is loosed and it gives the space for mistakes to occur in the cell. Our understanding of methylation in cancer is very important because it could be usted not only for monitoring but also,  for the development of new therapy taking in consideration that this a mutagenic process, but also an epigenetic one which means it could be reversed or changed. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes can occur during the lifespan and it is mitoticaly heritable. This means that any epigenetical change could have enduring effects on the epigenome. Althought this is a lifespan event there are some critical periods of development were are more likely to change epigeneticaly. This periods are called sensitive periods. We have different sensitive periods for different developmental stages. Taking in consideration that this process is mitoticaly heritable we have to be careful about treatment and/or exposure in these periods because we are just not talking about our health, we are talking about the health of all our subsequent family. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is the process by which you express only copy from the nonimprnted allele mothering of your parents but not both. Sometimes it happens tha you imprint one allele from my our father, as it happens with Igf2. The methylation of the paternal allele igf2 acts as an enhancement blocker. CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers And the methylation at ICR blocks the binding of this insulator protein causing spreading to H19 promoters to silence the enhances so Igf2 can activate. In the case of the expression of the mother allele this enhancers act directly on CTCF and H19 and Igf2 becomes silenced. igf2 promotes growth and this combinates with the loss of imprinting. It may happen that the maternal alleles starts acting as paternal because of any mutation, uniparental disomy or an epigenetic disruption. When this happens there is no Cdkn1c and there is more Igf2. This people have overgrowth and they become predisposed to childhood tumors like Wilm's tumor. This is all part of the Wiedemann syndrome. This process of overgrowth and loss of imprinting is also very important when in comes to cancer, because this is part of the mistakes that happens when developing cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic inhibitor for Decitabine are 5-aza-2' deoxycitidine. This induces DNA demethylation which implies the re expression of  silenced genes. This happens because the genes are epigenetic and are allowed to be changed, in this case with Decitabine. Decitabine can have an anti tumor effect because it works by controlling histone over methylation and silences surroundgenes including the tumor suppressor so the cell growth could be controlled. </p></div>
