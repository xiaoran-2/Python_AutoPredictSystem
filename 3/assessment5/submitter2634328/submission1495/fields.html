    <div class="field-value"><p>There are certain regions in human genome, where one can find more CG base pairs as expected by pure chance or statistics. These regions are called <strong>CpG islands</strong> and they are usually located nearby the promoters of genes.</p>
<p>In <strong>normal genome</strong>, CpG islands are <strong>protected from methylation</strong>, though there are some cell-type dependent exceptions. In <strong>cancer cells</strong>, however, <strong>CpG islands are hypermethylated</strong>, causing tumor suppressor genes to be silenced and due to mitotical heritability of methylation state contribute to uncontrolled growth of the tumor. Different CpG islands are methylated in different tumors which enable scientists to distinguish the tumor types based on this parameter and state prognosis and treatment in particular case.</p>
<p>Unlike CpG islands, <strong>intergenic regions and repetitive elements are heavily methylated in normal genome</strong> ensuring genomic integrity and stability. <strong>Hypomethylation of them in cancer</strong> causes irregular recombination, deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations and other <strong>mutagenic processes</strong> in genome. As promoters of oncogenes are not silenced by methylation they contribute so the growing and spreading of the tumor.</p>
<p>Genome-wide hypomethylation is the typical symptom of basically all tumor types and it was the first epigenetic abnormality discovered in cancer back in 1983.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In <strong>normal genome, imprinted genes are expressed from only one allele</strong> depending whether maternal or paternal allele is imprinted (silenced) for particular gene. Imprinted genes are quite often <strong>responsible for growth</strong> (proto-onco genes).</p>
<p>In <strong>cancer cells, imprinting is lost due to alterations in DNA methylation</strong> at ICR (imprinting control regions). Hypo- or hypermethylation causes imprinted genes to be expressed from both alleles or not expressed at all. This leads to<strong> improper gene dosage</strong> and to subsequent harmful phenotypic consequences.</p>
<p>In <strong>Igf2/H19 cluster</strong> for example, paternal allele of H19 gene as well as ICR is methylated, CTCF insulator element can not therefore bind to ICR. Enhancers act on<strong> lgf2 gene causing it’s paternal expression.</strong></p>
<p>On the maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated enabling CTCF to attach and redirecting enhancers to act upon H19 gene, while insulated<strong> Igf2 gene is silenced on maternal allele.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In tumor cells, ICR of this cluster is hypermethylated leading to overexpression of lgf2 gene</strong> (double dose) causing Wilm’s kidney tumor phenotypically. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According to the article<strong> Decitabine</strong> belongs to <strong>DNA-demethylating agents</strong>. From the name of this category we can infer this drug<strong> reduces the methylation of DNA</strong> in tumor cells (and in all other cells as well unfortunately). This process can consequently <strong>activate tumor suppressor genes</strong> that had been <strong>silenced by DNA or histone hypermethyation</strong> in particular regions and force the tumor cells to <strong>slow down their growth rate</strong>. Moreover, this kind of agents exhibit two remarkable features. Combined with histone-deacetylase inhibitors they can act upon solid tumors and they enhance the effect of routine chemotherapeutic drugs applied.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Back in the first week of this course we were informed about how <strong>mitotic heritability of epigenetic marks</strong> including DNA methylation is ensured. When <strong>DNA methylation is altered by drugs</strong>, mitotic heritability is able to <strong>pass this epigenetic state</strong> to daughter cells so that the effect on epigenome lasts after the drug treatment was finished.</p>
<p>However, there are crucial <strong>sensitive periods</strong> in human development when our genome undergoes complete epigenetic reprogramming, namely in<strong> early embryonic</strong> pre-implantation and early post-implantation phase to ensure totipotency of the zygote, later during <strong>primordial germ cells</strong> development and also during not very well understood <strong>cells differentiation process</strong>.</p>
<p>The drug treatment of pregnant women during these sensitive periods of embryonic development may <strong>alter the epigenome of the child and lead to variety of related diseases</strong> when incorrect epigenetic state would spread through the growing embryo by mitosis.</p></div>
