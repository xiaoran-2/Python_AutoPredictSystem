    <div class="field-value"><div class="im">
<p><strong>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands</strong> is that serves to silence gene expression, and that is needed for X chromosome inactivation in females, which occurs to have the same dose of X chromosomes than males. Although you could also find most of <strong>CpG islands</strong> of the genome are usually unmethylated.</p>
<p><strong>In a normal cell,</strong> you will find methylation at <strong>intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong> (so most part of the genome is silenced), in this case CpG islands are usually unmethylated as I said; this helps to maintain genomic integrity (so less mutations like translocations or insertions, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>In cancer,</strong> you have the opposite: repetitive elements and intergenic regions are unmethylated (hypomethylation) and CpG islands are methylated (in fact, hypermethylated). So bad mutations between chromosomes are able to occur and a person with cancer will have more instability in his genome and aberrant epigenetic control of gene expression. DNA methylation tends to be strong in some CpG islands that normally mustn't, and at the same time, the levels of 5mC are going down in the infected cell; that's when your normal cell has been invaded by cancer, and it has metastasis. Cancer tend to activate oncogenes (genes that are involved in growth cell) and silence tumor suppressors (genes that remove tumors) and this can be genetic or epigenetic.</p>
<p>Besides <strong>genetic diseases</strong> can occur when bad mutations modify, for example, the number of chromosomes, having more or less copies than you should... (phenotype: XXY, XXX...); there are also other diseases that affect the structure of the chromosomes. In fact we also know that DNA methylation is mutagenic, and mutations can bring disease as I said before, but also can bring biological adaptations to the environment.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine -a cytidine analog and DNA demethylating agent used for myelodysplastic syndromes- binds to specific epigenetic modifiers as <strong>DNMT</strong>, inhibiting it's function. High doses are too toxic and non-specific, without any good results. However in low doses it kills cancer cells because they cause DNA demethylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferasa, so it hypomethylates DNA. So the gene is more likely to be activated because of the hypomethylation and that also reduces the genomic stability, having side effects, for example: haematological malignances.</p>
<p>When it is incorporated into the DNA upon replication, the DNA methyltransferase <strong>(DNMT1</strong>) comes along to bind that nucleotide to copy the methylation of the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bounded irreversibly and it can no longer be released. So the action of these inhibitors is division dependence: you need to have the cell replicating. Cancer cells which are dividing quickly than most other cells, will be more affected because they replicate more.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>A sensitive period</strong> is when epigenetic marks need to be cleared between generations to restore totipotency of cells.</p>
<p><strong>There are two sensitive periods: pre-implantation period in early development</strong> (this is before the embryo implants and makes the placenta) and <strong>primordial germ cell development</strong>.</p>
<p>Altering <strong>DNA methylation can have enduring effects</strong> on the epigenome because genes that should be silenced (because they could cause a disease), would be activated, changing and de-regulating normal cell processes.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Treating patients during sensitive periods</strong> would be inadvisable because we could change their changes in DNA methylation, modifying their epigenetic marks in a bad way. In the sensitive periods erasing epigenetic marks is essential for have a "clean" epigenome and restore the right function cells during development. When a disease is erased in the sensitive periods because the epigenetic marks of fathers are erased, it won't return to the daughther cell, so<span> epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells with <span>chemotherapy.</span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When the ICR on the <strong>patternal allele</strong> is methylated, the CTCF protein can't bind (so no insulator action) and then enhancers are free to act on lgf2, promoting it's expression. Also H19 is not expressed on the patternal allele, because of the heterochromatin spreading which happens as another consecuence of the ICR methylation. This ICR methylation spreads until the promoter H19, so it's silenced because is a CPG island promoter. Although methylation at imprinted genes doesn't always have to be correlated with silencing of gene expression.</p>
<p>On the <strong>matternal allele</strong> this ICR is unmethylated; it's bound by CTCF, this insulates lgf2. Enhancers are free to act on H19 -enhancing it's expression-. This happens because of the chromatin looping between the enhancers and lgf2, but when CTCF blocks by it's binding, the secondary preference would happen: the enhancers loop to H19, so they promote H19 expression.</p>
<p><strong>In WT with loss of imprinting</strong> produces activation of <span>the normally silent maternal allele and an aberrant methylation, but no mutations. The CTCF<span> gene is needed for <span>the regulation of normal imprinting, bad methylation in this gene can deregulate other sites. We can see a complete methylation of a CTCF binding site in H19 in WT when it should be unmethylated. </span></span></span></p>
