    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are ordinarily not methylated, even if they are associated with the promoters of inactive genes. However in cancer CpG islands associated with promoters frequently become hypermethylated. This causes the corresponding genes to be silenced. Tumor suppressor genes work against cancer, and when they are silenced this can aid the proliferation of cancer. Some examples of hypermethylation of CpG islands associated with specific cancers are RB in retinoblastoma and BRCA1 in breast cancer.
In other (non-CpG island) intragenic regions DNA methylation usually correlates with reduced expression, or silencing of associated genes. However cancer typically leads to hypomethylation throughout the genome. Cancer promoting genes (oncogenes) that are usually silenced by methylation may become active if CpG-poor intragenic regions associated with their expression (e.g. promoters and enhancers) become hypomethylated. These activated oncogenes can cause increased tumor proliferation, an example is R-RAS in gastric cancer. Hypomethlyation of repeat elements can lead to genome instability for several reasons. Because recombination during mitosis happens at homologous regions, when repeats lose their methylation incorrect recombination can occur. Another problem is that transposable elements can insert themselves elsewhere in the genome if they are not silenced by methylation. An additional possibility is that cryptic promoters can become active promoters which can cause disruption to neighboring genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster lies in an imprinting control region (ICR). The Igf2 (Insulin growth factor 2) gene codes for a growth promoting hormone. Igf2 is repressed by the protein CTCF, which can bind the H19 ICR when H19 is not methylated.  On the paternal allele H19 is methylated but not expressed, CTCF cannot bind and Igf2 is expressed. In contrast on the maternal allele H19 is not methylated – hence expressed, CTCF binds the insulator and Igf2 is not expressed. The result is a single dose of Igf2 (and H19) expression. In Wilm’s tumor the maternal H19 is also methylated. This means that cells receive a double dose of Igf2, and no H19 is expressed. Cells no longer receive a balance of growth and growth inhibiting signals, but rather a double growth signal, leading to tumor production. This cancer of the kidneys typically occurs in children.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Economist article “Cancer’s epicentre” discusses the drug Decitabine which is currently marketed as Dacogen as a treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes. Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents, so its effect is to reduce the methylation of the genome.  Methylation of the genome is one aspect of the epigenome.  In cancers CpG islands become hypermethlyated, as described in the response to question one. If Decitabine is able to demethylate promoters for tumor suppressors the tumor suppressors will have greater expression, resulting in an anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">How is it that DNA methylation altering drugs can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Methylation state is passed on during mitosis from mother cell to daughter cell. The drug treatment will reduce methylation and turn on tumor suppressor genes in many cells. Even after the patient stops taking the drug, descendants of these cells will have the same reduced level of methylation, and same active tumor suppressor genes. Hence the patients tumors may be more vulnerable to treatment by chemotherapy.
During human development there are sensitive periods, which are periods during which perturbations can have a significant effect. Two epigenetically sensitive periods are embryogenesis and gametogenesis. As noted in the lectures on environmental effects on epigenetics, sensitive periods are primarily those during which epigenetic marks are being set, not just maintained. For example the Dutch famine cohort study found that a mother’s exposure to famine during the peri-conconceptual period (from before conception to early pregnancy) led health led to increased health problems in the child. The Overkalix study showed that the sensitive period for food supply was the “slow growth period” which was was 9-12 years for males and 8-10 years, plus fetal and infant life for females.  Studies of rat maternal behavior showed that the time right after birth may also be a sensitive period. It would be inadvisable to treat a patient with a drug that has epigenetic effects during a sensitive period because one may be erasing a critical epigenetic mark. For example we know that insufficient folate, which is a source of methyl groups, is linked to birth defects. If a pregnant woman took a drug that was a DNA demethylase, it could potentially remove important methylation in the fetus, leading to similar effects.
