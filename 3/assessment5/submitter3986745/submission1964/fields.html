    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG island is an specific epigenetic modification commonly associated with silencing of gene expression.  Being aware that role of DNA methylation is context dependent, we could say that normal cells presents generally hypomethylated CpG islands and usually kept free of methylation, and cancer cells often presents hypermethylated CpG islands. As it’s described one of the commons aberrations in epigenetic control seen in cancer is the DNA methylation. This epigenetic mark found in CGIs is an alternative to genetic mutation and contributes in hallmarks such as evading growth suppressors. The methylation of CpG islands can lead to inappropriate gene silencing such as the silencing of tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells. In other words, the increase in DNA methylation (which is mitotically heritable) can result in blockage of the activity of suppressor genes that regulate cell division and growth. The disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease allowing the growth of the tumor and also contributes in the clinical knowledge of the tumor. CpG island hypermethylation helps the diagnosis of disease and also give information of the prognosis and treatment which is important for the control of the tumor.  </p>
<p>The normal function of the DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are related with the methylation status of them. These intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in normal cells and they’re hypomethylated in cancer cells. The hypomethylation in cancer cells contributes to the open status of the chromatin or non densely packaging of the chromatin and this epigenetic mark results in genomic instability with abnormalities such as illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, or activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region (ICR) of H19/Igf2 cluster (controlled by enhancer blocking and paternal imprinted), is unmethylated on maternal allele and methylated on paternal allele. The different methylation pattern of the alleles determines <em>Igf2 </em>expression status.</p>
<p>When ICR is unmethylated the CTCF insulator protein is bound and is able to insulate <em>Igf2 </em>from downstream enhancers. The enhancers are free to act on <em>H19</em> and enhance on the maternal allele the expression of this gene for a long noncoding RNA. Moreover, while the prefer chromosome looping is between enhancers and <em>Igf2,</em> when CTCF it’s bind to unmethylated ICR the looping that occurs is between the enhancers and <em>H19</em>.  What happens on the paternal allele is that the DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding and consequently there isn’t insulating action and enhancers are free to promote the expression of <em>Igf2</em> on the paternal allele and also without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to <em>H19</em> promoter to silence.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor we observe a loss of imprinting, the ICR is methylated on the maternal allele and that means a double dose of <em>Igf2 </em>which is a growth promoting gene and whose overexpression is associated with this tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The fact that epigenetic processes are susceptible to chemical interventions makes these processes open to drug treatment. An example of that is the discovery of an epigenetic inhibitor called decitabine and classified as a DNA-demethylation agent or DNMT inhibitor (DNMTi). This anti-tumor chemotherapy drug or  DNMT inhibitor is a nucleoside analogue replication dependent that irreversibly bind DNMTs after it’s incorporated into DNA and it’s known for his effect in myelodysplastic syndrome treatment. Decitabine works by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA and consequentially restoring the normal function of tumor suppressor genes that regulate cell division and growth.</p>
<p>Decitabine is also known for being an antimetabolite. That means that when the cells incorporate this agent into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>By altering DNA methylation effects such as genomic instability, deregulation of tissue, imprinted genes and silencing of genes can be observed in the epigenome and some of them can be enduring and mitotically heritable what means that they are going to be on the daughter cells and they can cause tissue problems like tumors.  </p>
<p>It’s generally believed that early life constitutes a sensitive period. In a general context a sensitive periods refer to important periods of childhood development until the age of 6 years. However, in a epigenetic context, a sensitive period means a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. Some experiments had shown that experiences during sensitive periods of development influence DNA methylation patterns of several genes. These experience-induce DNA methylation patterns represents stable epigenetic modifications that alter gene transcription throughout the lifespan and promote specific behavioral outcomes. These findings could be a reason for why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.  </p>
