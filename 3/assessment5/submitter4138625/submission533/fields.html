    <h1>Submission 533 from Anon (session_user_id: bdb86885a994a23c50424f75e622862752f9c577)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>ultimate fate of the cell is defined the by the type and frequency of the genes being expressed and swithced off. epigenetic regulators of gene transcription such as DNA methylation plays vital role in maintaining and changing the state of the cell. DNA hypermethylation in the region containing promotor make the genes silence. if it occurs in the region containing genes for cell differentiation and genes controling cell proliferation normal cell become cancerous. </p>
<p>hypermethylation is associated with MDS, leukemia etc.</p>
<p>1. Decitabine belongs to class DNA methylation inhibitors. </p>
<p>2. Decitabine causes hypomethylation of  DNA as it is analogous to cytocine. after it s  incorporation furthur methylation is inhibited.</p>
<p>3. Decitabine have anti-tumor effect as it shows toxic effect on MDS cell. it also turns on abbarently switched off genes such as tumor suppresor genes and makes tumor cells normal by restoring their normal epigenetic state.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.DNA methylation shows mitotic heritbaility. it is an important gene transcription regulator. once the epigenome of the cell is established it remains same unless it is removed actively. therefore when drug is applied to change the methylation pattern of cancer cells it remains same even after the use of drug is stoped.</p>
<p>2. Sensitive period in epigenetics is the time period when  old epigenetic marks are erased and new marks are being established. during this period environment  have maximum influence on the epigenome of the cell. thus environmental changes are during sensitive periods show mitotic inheritance. this is the period of the establishment of epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>3.there are two sensitive periods in embryonic devlopment i.e epiblast of gastrula and mid gestation (primordial germ cells formation). period of slow growth is also sensitive.</p>
<p>4. During senstive periods of development patients are not treated because during this period epigenetic marks are being established therefore application of drug can cause more harm than benifits as cells are very sensitive to the environmental conditions.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>comparison of DNA methylation pattern in normal and cancer cells revealed that cancer cells shows global hypomethylation i.e low methylation at ICRs , intragenice regions, repitative regions such as micro satellites and cpg poor promoters. however hypermethylation was observed in cpg islands which usually exists near promotor regions therefore silencing the genes as hypermethylation proceeds to the shores. similar patterns were also observed in aged cells therefore aging do the same job.</p>
<p>1. hypomethylation of cpg islands keep the tumor suppressor , growth regulating and other vital genes on it also results in the loss of genomic imprinting resulting in the loss of genome stability as deletion, Reciprocal traslocation and addition in chromosomes takes place . global hypermethylation keeps the genomic parasites i.e transposable elements (retrotransposons) , LINEs, and SINEs are kept silent.</p>
<p>2. Epimutations such as methylation disruption/hypermethylation occur due to errors i.e over expression of DNMTs or suppression of these enzymes resulting from mutation, deletion, translocation and the most important factor is aging. As cells grow older these error occur more frequently.</p>
<p>3. methylation at intragenic regions and repitative elements maintains genome stability and keeps viral remnants in genome (retrotransposons) silent.</p>
<p>4. when  methylation in intragenic and repitative elements is disrupted over expression, suppression of genes take place and also cause mutations turning normal cells to cancerous cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>gene imprinting controls the dose of gene expression. any disruption in the imprinting pattern can also casue cancer. e.g igf2 is growth promoting gene that shares enhancer with the H19 gene. ICR in maternal chormosome is not imprinted while it is methylated in paternal chromosome therefore insulating protien CTCF can bind to ICR of maternal chromosome which  prevents Igf2 from accessing that promotor as insulating protien CTCF binds to ICR on maternal chromosome hence H12 is expressed only in maternal chromosome. but on paternal chromosome Igf2 is expressed as ICR and H12 gene is imprinted.</p>
<p>when methylation pattern is disrupted . ICR and H19 are imprinted on both chromosomes enhancer is only used by the igf2 as CTCF fails to bind at ICR hence a double dose of growth promoting gene igf2  results in cancer. (wilm s tumour)</p></div>
