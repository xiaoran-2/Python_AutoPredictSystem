    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation pattern in cancer cells is very different when compared to normal cells.  In cancer cells, methylation is increased (hypermethylation) at CpG islands and shores, while the rest of the genome tends to get less methylated (hypomethylation). </p>
<p>In normal cells, methylation at CpG islands is generally associated with gene silencing.  Methylation pattern at CpG islands is heritable and copied by DNMT1 after mitotic division.  A cell identifies the original DNA after mitotic division by its methylation.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of CpC islands in cancer causes silencing of tumor supressor genes.  Hypermethylation can be one of the hits in Knudson hypothesis of multiple hits for cancer development.  As methylation is heritable and hypermethylated cells proliferate selectively resulting in tumor growth.  The same also applies to the hypomethylated cells.</p>
<p>DNA methylation of intergenic regions helps stabilize the genome and help silence cryptic transcription start sites.  DNA methylation of repetitive elements also help stabilize the genome by eliminating movement (illegitimate recombinations) of transposable elements within the genome.  In normal cells repetitive element are heavily chromatinized and not easily accessible for recombinations.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetive elements are hypomethylated (methyl groups removed extensively) resulting in less stable genome and significant amount of illegitimate recombinations, deletions and insertions. In addition, repeats are activated and jump around causing damage to the genome.  They may also activate neighboring genes causing transcriptional aberrations within the cell.  All these changes are mutagenic and may cause a cell to grow and multiply without control by activation of growth promoters.  Hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is common to all types of cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor.  It works by irreversibly blocking DNMT proteins (enzymes) in dividing cells. The mechanism of action is not fully understood,  It is thought that decitabine is incorporated into the DNA in rapidly dividing cells.  During methylation DNMT enzymes are irreversibly deactivated by binding of decatabine, reducing DNA methylation very significantly.  The resulting hypomethylation of DNA impacts rapidly dividing cells more effectively compared to normal cells and selectively kills rapidly dividing cells (cancer cells).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is possible that epigenetic drugs alter cells in some lasting ways.  This may be possible by combined effects of demethylation (or deacetylation) and resulting changes in gene activity (activation or deactiavation of some genes) which may change the behaviour of cancer cells.  Changes in methylation and acetylation may cause changes in DNA chromatinization and organization of DNA in nucleus resulting in additional changes in cell behaviour, possibly making the cell more susceptible to traditional chemotheraphy drugs.  These changes will likely be retained in new cells generated by mitotic division maintaining the susceptibilty to standard chemo in newly generated cells.</p>
<p>Treatment of cells with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods where epigenetic marks (or programs) are cleared and reprogrammed can result in unpredictable, potentially dangerous, impact on cell programming.  These sensitive period are observed during pre-implantation development of embryo and during primordial germ cell development.  Development of embryo and germ cells will be impacted by epigenetic drugs if children or pregnant women are treated with these drugs as reprogramming of the epigenetic machinery will be modified by the drugs.  This will result in significant developmental impact on the embryo or the germ cells which may also impact the future generations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells the ICR of the paternal allele of H10/Igf2 cluster is methylated and ICR for the maternal allele is unmethylated.   The CTCF insulator protein binds the unmethyhaled maternal allele insulating the IGF2 (preventing the expression) in the maternal allele.  Enhancers in that case selectively act on H19.  In the paternal allele, CTFC can not bind to the ICR because of the methylation of the ICR region.  As a result, the enhancers act on Igf2 gene preferentially, causing expression of Igf2.  In case of Wilm's tumor, the ICRs of both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated.  As a result, CTFC can not bind to any of the ICRs to silence Igf2.   Igf2 genes for both the maternal and the paternal alleles are expressed creating an over expression of Igf2 (double the normal amount).  Igf2 is a growth promoter and over expression of IGF2 causes generation and growth of Wilm's tumors.</p></div>
