    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation functions normally to control the expression of genes in a particular cell type.  CpG islands are found in the promoters of genes and are typically not methylated, but when they are, methylation functions to silence the gene. In cancer, CpG islands are often hypermethylated in a locus-specific manner, selectively silencing the expression of tumor suppressor genes, which removes the anti-growth activities in cells and tips the balance toward growth.  This unchecked growth is a critical step in the formation of cancer, which is essentially an overgrowth of cells. </p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements of DNA, CpGs are typically methylated in a normal genome in order to promote genetic stability.  When intergenic regions are not methylated, mutations such as insertions, deletions, and reciprocal translocations occcur.  Methylation in repetitive elements prevent activity of transposons, which are sections of DNA that are viral in origin and can jump around the genome.  In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are abnormally hypomethylated, and this lack of methylation allows large-scale mutations, activates transposons, and can turn genes off or on incorrectly, leading to genomic instability and loss of regular cell functioning.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Wilm's tumor is a type of cancer that results from epigenetic alterations in the H19/Igf2 cluster, where the maternal and paternal alleles are differentially expressed based on imprinted methylation.  In the normally-functioning H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is imprinted-- methylated in the imprint control region-- blocking the binding of the CTCF insulator protein and thus allowing the downstream enhancers to act on the Igf2 gene.  Further, the methylation spreads to the promotor of H19 and prevents H19 transcription.  In the maternal allele, the lack of methylation in the imprint control region allows for the binding of CTCF, which insulates the enhancers' action on Igf2 and thus prevents Igf2 expression.  Instead, the enhancers act upon H19.  In the case of Wilm's tumor, the imprinting is altered: The maternal allele becomes hypermethylated, resembling the paternal allele and resulting in a double dose of Igf2 expression.  Since Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, overexpression can lead to cancer, which is by definition an unchecked proliferation of cells.  In Wilm's tumor cells, the hypermethylation occurs early in tumorigenesis and contributes to overgrowth of cells in the kidneys of children.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cancer drug in the class of DNMTi, or DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.  This class works by incorporating directly into the DNA and preventing action of the enzyme DNA methyltransferase, which lays down the methyl group on the cytosine.  This drus is replication dependent and over time results in an undoing of the hypermethylation that occurs in tumor supressor genes in cancerous cells-- as the cells replicate, the methylated DNA is diluted by the unmethylated strands which cannot be methylated.  As the DNA methylation is undone, the tumor suppressor genes can be reactivated and then function normally to suppress the tumor and keep growth in check.  Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable in the subsequent absence of the drug, daughter cells of the treated cells will also have normal methylation and active tumor suppressor genes, and thus the anti-tumor effect should last beyond treatment.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs have an effect lasting beyond the period of treatment because they can affect DNA methylation, which is mitotically heritable; that is, the daughter cells interit the same DNA methylation pattern as the mother cell.  If erroneous DNA methylation at tumor suppressor genes is removed by DNA-demethylating agents, the daughter cells will have normally functioning tumor suppressor genes, thus creating an enduring reversal of epigenetic damage that originally led to cancer. </p>
<p>These drugs, however, would be ill advised during epigenetically sensitive periods of development, when epigenetic marks are being reset.  These sensitive periods occur during pregnancy, during preimplantation development and premordial germ cell development during mid-gestation.  During these specific times of development, DNA methylation is removed and then re-established.  If drugs interfered with this process, the specific epigenetic signatures required for a body to function normally would be disrupted.  Therefore, the drugs should not be used during pregnancy.</p>
