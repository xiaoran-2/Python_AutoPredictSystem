    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the hallmark of different epigenetic pathways. Most of the DNA methylation occurs at cytosines that are followed by guanines, mostly because these dinucleotides (CpG) are symmetrical when considering the reverse strand of the DNA, which allows for this mark to be maintained through cell division. Most CpGs are found in CpG islands, which are regions where there are more CG dinucleotides than expected by chance. These in turn tend to be found in promoters of genes. In <strong>normal cells</strong> <strong>CpG islands</strong> are usually hypomethylated, methylation of these sites meaning silencing of that gene's expression. An example of gene silencing through CpG methylation in normal cells is X Chromosome inactivation. In <strong>cancer cells CpG islands</strong> tend to be hypermethylated, usually in the promoters of tumor supressor genes, which leads to silencing of these genes and further the cells with this pattern divide more rapidly and undergoe less apoptosis, that will eventually turn into cancer. Examples of such silencing through promoter CpG hypermethylation events are the MLH1 which causes Lynch syndrome, BRCA1 and BRCA2 which causes breast cancer and MGMT found in gliomas and colorectal cancers (which also has therapeutical implication-the loss of MGMT causes a loss of response to temozolomide because of inability to metabolize it to an active form).</p>
<p>In the intergenic regions and repetitive elements in <strong>normal cells</strong> DNA methylation occurs at high rate and is responsible for maintaining genetic integrity, avoiding transcriptional interference and protecting the genome from transposable elements. In <strong>cancer cells </strong>hypomethylation is found in these regions which leads to genomic instability, illegitimate recombinations, deletios, insertions, reciprocal translocations, disruption of imprintig. This can lead to disruptions of coding regions or promoters that become active and cause alterations of gene expression which in turn will cause the occurence of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/IGF2 is an imprint control region (ICR) cluster on human chromsome 11. The paternal allele ICR is methylated and therefore imprinted.</p>
<p>The maternal allele is unmethylated and a long noncoding RNA (H19)is being transcribed from the mother. When the ICR is unmethylated, like it happens on the mother allele, it is bound by CTCF, an insulator protein. Binding of CTCF blocks the downstream enhancers to act on the IGF2 from the maternal allele, but in turn the enhancers increase H19 expression.</p>
<p>Since the paternal allele is methylated, CTCF is not binding, so the enhancers can act directly on IGF2, which repreesents their first target. That is why under normal conditions IGF2 is expressed only from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor there is a hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele, so enhancers induce IGF2 expression from both maternal and paternal alleles. IGF2 is a growth promoting gene (oncogene) and the double dose of it leads to childhood kidney tumors.</p>
<p> A loss of imprinting because of deletions or mutations in this region when both alleles act like the paternal (unipaternal disomy) causes a condition called Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, when the Kcnq1 cluster is also affected.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent acting by inhibiting DNMT1 and the catalytic sites of DNMT3a and DNMT3b. Decitabine reduces DNA methylation in cancer cells, leading thus to reversal of promoter DNA hypermethylation and the associated gene silencing. If the cancer, like myelodisplastic syndromes originates in the hypermethylation of the promoter of a tumor supressor gene, reestablishing the normal methylation state of that promoter can represent a good therapy for that cancer. This can be achieved without changing the DNA sequence and since this is an epigenetic trait, it will be transimtted through mitosis, which means that daughter cells will also have a normal methylation pattern, which explains the anti-tumor effect of decitabine. Also the reestablishment of normal promoter methylation status will lead to normal gene expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is transmitted through mitosis, as DNMT1 for example recognizes hemymethylated DNA molecules (when the daughter DNA molecule has one original strand which is methylated, and a newly syntesised strand which is not methylated) and methylates the newly formed strand.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period in development that is susceptible to environmental signals, like in the case of preimplantation period of the blastocyte and the formation of primordial germ cells.</p>
<p>It is inadvisable to treat patients in these sensitive periods, when the epigenetics is being reprogrammed, as this might interfere with the normal reprogramming and methylation pattern (that will further influence the offspring for example).</p></div>
