    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often found at gene promoters and are normally kept free of methylation.  Where methylation does occur, it normally leads to silencing of gene expression and formation of heterochromatin.  In X inactivation, CpG island methylation is seen at nearly all islands on the inactivated X.  CpG island methylation is also found at the imprint control region of imprinted genes.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands show hypermethylation (CpG island methylator phenotype) across all tumour types studied. The level of hypermethylation at certain CpG islands increases as cancer progresses. Hypermethylation is also seen at CpG island shores.  CpG island and island shore hypermethylation is often seen at the promoters of tumour suppressor genes (which protect cells against a step on the path to cancer), where it leads to silencing of those genes.  Evading of growth suppressors, resisting cell death and sustaining proliferative signals are possible outcomes and are all hallmarks of cancer.  Hypermethylation at imprint control regions often leads to loss of imprinting and is often a pre-neoplastic event in cancer development.</p>
<p>DNA at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is normally methylated.  At intergenic regions, methylation maintains genomic integrity (e.g. protection against karyotype changes) and silences cryptic start or splice sites.  At repetitive elements, methylation maintains genomic integrity and stability, ensuring silencing of repetitive elements and preventing illegitimate recombination by formation of heterochromatin.</p>
<p>In cancer, hypomethylation is seen at intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  This results in development of genomic instability through, for example, illegitimate recombination between repeats (possible because hypomethylation correlates with euchromatin – accessible DNA).  It also leads to activation and transposition of repeats which can disrupt gene expression or cause aberrant activation of a gene.  This results in deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations within the genome.  Genomic instability is an enabler of cancer development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation of imprint control regions (ICRs) in cancer leads to loss of improving and aberrant expression.  In a normal cell, the H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted – that is, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal.  On the maternal allele, the unmethylated ICR is bound by the CTCF insulator protein.  This insulates the neighbouring Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers.  Instead, the enhancers loop around to, and act on the H19 gene.  H19 is therefore expressed from the maternal allele.  Igf2 is not.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, methylation at the ICR blocks binding of CTCF which means that the enhancers can preferentially act on the Igf2 gene leading to Igf2 expression.  On this allele, ICR methylation also spreads downstream causing direct silencing of H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, methylation is seen on the ICRs of both the maternal and paternal alleles.  This means that both alleles act ‘as if’ they are paternal alleles, resulting in Igf2 expression from both alleles but no expression of H19.  Igf2 is a growth promoter, so a double dose of gene expression results in a double dose of the growth promoting protein.  This change is often seen in early neoplasia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor which acts in a cell-division-dependent manner to reduce methylation across the genome.  The mode of action is believed to be by incorporation of the drug, a nucleoside analogue, into DNA in place of the regular nucleotide during replication.  The drug then irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferase when it tries to methylate the new daughter strand: the DNA therefore does not receive methylation at that nucleotide and the binding also prevents methylation of other bases in the DNA.  This therefore reduces the overall level of DNA methyltransferase available in the cell and the overall level of methylation.  As CPG islands tend to be hypermethylated in cancer, they are likely to see particular reductions in methylation levels.  The drug has a disproportionate effect on cancer cells compared to normal because cancerous cells replicate at a faster rate.  An anti-neoplastic effect is seen at appropriate (low) doses.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.  Drugs used to treat cancer by altering DNA methylation will act on both cancerous and non-cancerous cells.  The pattern of methylation in the ‘normal’ epigenome will therefore be altered and maintained through cell division throughout the lifetime of the cell and its daughters.  The pattern of methylation effects both gene expression and nuclear organisation (e.g. methylated areas accumulating silencing signals and being located at the nuclear periphery).</p>
<p>There is particular risk in treating patients during sensitive periods of development.  Sensitive periods are defined as those during which  epigenetic reprogramming occurs – that is, in early pre-implantation development and in primordial germ cell development.  Disruption of the epigenome at these times would have particularly long-lasting effects – for example treatment of a pregnant woman would affect the epigenome of the patient, her developing foetus and the foetus’s developing germ cells (that is, three generations).  Treatment with a DNA methylation inhibitor in these times could change the methylation pattern of imprinted genes or repeats in the genome, leading to aberrant imprinting and gene expression, or to genomic instability.  It is not at all clear what the effect of such changes would be through the lifetime of a young patient or in the child of a patient treated during a sensitive period. </p></div>
