    <div class="field-value"><p>In epigenetics, DNA methylation at CpG islands can recruit proteins that may facilitate the formation of repressive chromatin structure, or block the binding of transcription factors, often resulting in gene silencing, and CpG islands are usually unmethylated in normal cells. Although it is known that the DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer, we don't fully understand how the disruption occurs. The possible answers is that during the lifetime, some genes or epigenetic marks are mutated or changes by chance, and cellular stress can somehow increase these possibility. These alterations may affect the expression of tumor suppressors (downregulated) or oncogenes (overexpress) that may cause tumorigenesis. For example, the aberrant hypermethylation of CpG islands of Riz1 gene will silence its transcription. The downregulation of RIZ1, which is responsible for methylation of H3K9, can cause aberrant gene overexpression, and further result in breast or liver cancer.</p>
<p>In contrast to CpG islands, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not associated with gene silencing but rather contribute to maintain genomic integrity, and both of them are usually methylated in normal cells. It has been shown that without methylation in intergenic regions, the genome will become unstable that chromosome insertion, deletion, or translocation may occur. For methylation in repetitive elements, it silence the transposition of transposons repeats and prevent forced transcription due to long terminal repeat (LTR) of transposons. As mentioned previously, the disruption of methylation status in cancer may caused by accumulation of random mutations and alterations. For instance, DNMT1 is an methyltransferase responsible for maintaining DNA methylation status, and the loss-of-function mutation in DNMT1 will result in overall hypomethylation in genome. Then, the possibility of tumorigenesis will be increased due to the genomic instability.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Wilm's tumor is caused by Igf2 overexpression. There are many possibilities that can result in Igf2 overexpression: first, ICR on maternal allele may have underwent mutation or deletion; second, the offspring inherent two copies of one paternal (which called uniparental disomy); Or, disruption of epigenetic imprinting status due to mutation or environment. All of the ICRs on maternal allele in these three examples can no longer recognize by CTCF, and both paternal and maternal allele can express Igf2. It is known that Igf2 is a oncogene that promotes growth. So, once Igf2 is overexpressed, the possibility of tumorigenesis will be increased.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, is the derivative of 5'-aza which use ubiquitously in molecular experiments. And because of its ability to inhibit the funciton of DNA methyltransferase, cells treated with Decitabine will cause DNA hypomethylation.</p>
<p>As we know that it is common to observe hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes in tumor cells, it is reasonable to apply demethylating agents to force the demethylation of these genes. Once the hypermethylation has been removed, the expression of tumor suppressor genes may restore to normal level as normal cells to prevent extensive proliferation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>We know that cells (especially cancer cells) can proliferate and divide into much more cells, and it is acceptable that the overexpression of a gene is temporally because the overexpressed gene will be diluted every round of cell cycle, unless re-express again. Different from gene overexpression, once DNA methylation has been established or removed, the current methylation status will inherit to its daughter cells. So, the DNA methylation status altered by epigenetic drugs can be last further.</p>
<p>However, epigenetic drugs treatment is not suitable for all the time. We know that during embryo development, there are two waves of epigenetic reprogramming, one is during early development, the other is during germ cell development. These two periods are very sensitive, because the changes in environment may disrupt the reprogramming and result in abnormal development. Hence, when we treat a patient during sensitive periods with epigenetic drugs, indeed, the disease may be cured, but the lasting drugs could alter the normal epigenetic condition required for successful development.</p>
