    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands normally are unmethylated because generally encode promoters of tumor supressor genes. In cancer the CpG island are hipermethylated, thus the gene expression is silencing,this means the cells will growth and multiply without limits.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated and  silenced, in cancer these regions are unmethylated, this make genomic instability by excesive production of repetitive elements allowing recombinations betwen repets, activations and transcriptions aberrant genes  and can lead the expression of tumor promoters  by deregulation of imprinting regions or tissue specific genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the example of theH19/Igf2 cluster in a normal cell  exist a maternal allele with an imprinting control region unmethylated were a lncRNA(CTCF) bind and enhance expresion of H19 and block expresion of Igf2, in the paternal allele the imprinting control region is methylated and the CTFC can´t bind, this block the expresion of H19 and the enhancers promote the expresion of Igf2. In the Wilm´s tumor this pattern of imprinting is disrupted, and there are two copies of the paternal allele, thus there is an overexpression of Igf2 which is a cell growth promoter (oncogen) allowing an uncontrolled growth of cell in the kidney of this child. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a group of drugs named DNA-demethylating agents, they act on DNA methylations which are overexpress in CpG islands  in most tumors,the tarjet of this drug is the enzime DNA-methyltransferase and inhibit it . The effect of this kind of drugs is erase DNA- methylation of the tumor cells and this way avoid that the hiper methylation pass on during cell division to daughter cells, thus make lower tumor growth.This drug is used for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Once DNA-methylation is erase this do not return because every epigenetic mark is passed on to the daughter cells in the mitotic division. The effect of this drugs is not cell tipe selective and division dependent, it is more effective on cells with active division.This is the reason why is inadvisable to treating children and young patients spetially under germ cells development because they can get new epigenetic patron and can develop iatrogenic cancer, these ages are identified as sensitive periods of development.</p></div>
