    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>DNA methylation tends to be both globally decreased (hypomethylation) and locally increased (hypermethylation) in cancer. The result of this is expression of harmful factors  like oncogenes, repetitive elements and noncoding RNAs and the suppression of useful genes like tumor suppressors, the combination of which can cause cancer.  </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Methylation of CpG islands suppresses the transcription of nearby regions of DNA. This can silence the expression of genes as well as repetitive elements  and noncoding RNAs in intergenic regions.  If a particular gene causes cancer, silencing it is beneficial, and if repetitive elements and noncoding RNAs contribute to cancer, silencing them is also beneficial.  </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But if methylation is reduced genome wide, trouble-causing genes like oncogenes that should be silenced may be expressed and trouble-causing repetitive elements and noncoding RNAs that should be silenced may be expressed.  The result of the expression of these undesirable factors can be part of what causes cancer.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Methylation can also suppress the expression of genes that contribute to reducing or eliminating cancer. Tumor suppressor genes, for example, code for proteins that regulate the normal cell cycle, and if the genes that code for them are not expressed, the cell cycle can be disrupted and result in a cancerous cell. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>So it’s likely that the combination of hypomethylation and hypermethylation leads to cancer –  global hypomethylation activating undesirable effects that would otherwise be inactive and local hypermethylation silencing beneficial effects that would otherwise be active.   </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>There is an enhancer/blocker between the H19 and Igf2 genes that acts in a reciprocal way so that one of the genes is expressed while the other is silenced. So if H19 is expressed then Igf2 is silenced and vice-versa.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In normal cells, this region is methylated in the male allele, which causes the Igf2 gene to be expressed and the H19 gene to be silenced. In normal cells, this region is unmethylated in the female allele, which causes the Igf2 gene to be silenced and the H19 gene to be expressed. This results in the expression of both H19 and Igf2, the combination of which seems to promote normal, healthy cell growth.</span></p>
<p><span><span>In the case of Wilm’s tumor, the enhancer/blocker on the female allele between the H19 and Igf2 genes becomes methylated. This effectively changes the state of the female allele to the same state as the normal male allele so that it also expresses Igf2. This results in the overexpression of Igf2 and the underexpression of H19. Without the H19 to regulate it, cell growth happens at an abnormal rate which results in Wilm’s tumor.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>The drug decitabine is a type of DNA-demethylating agent. These reduce the level of methylation of a genome. If methylation has silenced genes that are necessary for normal, healthy cell function, reducing the level of methylation can activate genes that were silenced by methylation. If doing this restores the expression of genes that are needed for normal, healthy cell function, it can treat tumors that are caused by the silencing of necessary genes.  </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Drugs that alter the methylation of DNA can have effects that last long after the period of drug treatment. This is because methylation is mitotically heritable: the descendants of a cell that acquires a particular pattern of methylation can inherit the same pattern. This may have important consequences in understanding the appropriate use of epigenetic drugs.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Research has suggested that mammals have various “sensitive periods” during which their epigenome is particularly susceptible to epigenetic modification: the time from becoming a fertilized egg to becoming an epiblast, and the period from when primordial germ cells are created to the production of gametes. Because of the lasting detrimental side-effects that could occur if an epigenetic drug is administered during one of these periods, their use during one of those periods should probably be avoided. </span></span></p></div>
