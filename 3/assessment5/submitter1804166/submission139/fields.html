    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation, occuring at the C5 of the cytosine base, is present at the majority of CpG dinulceotides (70-80%) in the mammalian genome. However, clusters of CpG dinulceotides termed CpG islands (found in 60% of promoters) are generally kept clear of methylation. Methylation at these CpG islands leads to gene silencing via the formation of repressive chromatin structure. This is mediated by methlyated CpG-binding proteins such as MeCP 1/2 which are able to recruit other factors capable of condensing chromatin. In normal somatic cells methylation occurs at intergenic regions and in the body of highly expressed genes. It is believed that this leads to silencing of transcriptional noise from cryptic starts sites or cryptic splice sties which could interfere with normal transcription. In addition CpGs within repetitive elements also tend to me methylated, in order to prevent transposition, silence promoters which can be found in their long terminal repeats (LTRs) (which could interfere with normal transcription) and to prevent illegitmate recombination. Overall, the major purpose of methylation outside of CpG islands is to maintain genomic stability. However, in cancer, normal methylation patterns are altered. There is a general genome wide hypomethylation and selective hypermethylation of CpG islands within promoters, especially those regulating tumour supressor gene expression. The hypomethylation occurs at both intergenic regions and repetitive elemets. This leads to genominc instability via a number of mechanisms. There can be illegitimate recombination between repeats and transposition can occur, leading to insertions which can disrupt other genes or lead to upregulation of neighbouring genes (for exapmple oncogenes) due to the strong promoters within the LTRs. In addition, hypermethylation is seen at CpG islands, termed CIMP. This results in silencing of the downstream genes which are often tumour supressor genes<em> </em>which would otherwise help prevent progression to cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are subject to differential methylation in cancer. Many imprinted genes play a role in promoting or suppressing growth, over expression or silencing (respectively) due to altered methylation can contribute to cancer progression e.g. the H19/Igf2 cluster, in Wilm's tumour. Noramlly this cluster is paternally imprinted, thus the paternal ICR (imprint control region) is methylated while the maternal ICR remains unmethylated. On the paternal allele the methylation of the ICR spreads to the promoter of H19. Igf2 and H19 share downstream enhancers. When methylated the paternal ICR cannot be bound by the CTCF protein which is an insulator, therefore the downstream enhancers are able to access the Igf2 gene leading to expression. On the maternal allele, CTCF can bind to the unmethylated ICR, this means that the enhancers cannot access Igf2 which is not expressed, but instead interact with H19 which is expressed. In Wilm's tumour, this cluster becomes hypermethylated, so both alleles resemble the paternal allele. This means that both ICRs are methylated and CTCF can no longer bind. This means that Igf2 is expressed from both alleles meaning cells recieve a double dose, therefore these cells have a greater proliferative potential. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl-transferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It is a nuleoside analogue which becomes incorporated into DNA during replication then it irreversibly binds to DNMTs, inhibiting their action. DNMTs are responsible for mainintaing DNA methylation following mitosis. Treatment with Decitabine leads to global hypomethylation. As its mode of action is dependent on replication it will be more active against cancer cells which are a rapidly dividing cell type. The hypomethylation will impact the cancer in many ways. It will remove silencing of tumour suppressor genes which will help to slow the progression of the cancer or may lead to apoptosis. Methylation of imprinted genes will also be removed leading to reduced expression of some growth promoting factors (e.g Igf2) or increased expression of some growth inhibitory factors. In addition, there will be increased genomic instablity by removal of methylation at repetitive elements which could lead to cell death. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a stable and mitotically heritable epigenetic mark. Following replication, DNA methylation is faithfully copied to the newly synthesised strands by DNMT3a and 3b, meaning both daughter cells will have the same methylation pattern as the parental cell. If the DNA methylation pattern in cancer cells is altered using drugs, this will be faithfully copied to all daughter cells meaning that the changes wil have lasting consequence even after the drug has gone on all susequenct generations of cells. There are two periods in development which are considered to be sensitive periods. These occur from primordial germ cell deveolpment to production of mature gametes and the preimplantation to early post implantation periods, both of which coincide with active remodelling of the epigenome. These periods are the most sensitive to changes in the environment. Therefore, it will be inadvisable to administer drugs which alter the epigenome during these periods, as they could interfere wil normal epigenomic remodelling any effect the drugs have would be passed on the next generation.  </p></div>
