    <h1>Submission 2130 from Anon (session_user_id: f079b409eb332746f48cb48579033ed60307828c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Decitabine belongs to the class of </span><strong style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">DNA-demethylating gents</strong><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> or hypomethylating agents. </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Deciatabine is metabolized and phospho-</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">rylated inside the cell and then incorporated into DNA, </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">where it is recognized by DNA methyltransferases </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">(DNMTs), the enzymes responsible for DNA methylation.</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The covalent complexes formed by the abnormal bases and </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">DNMT result in <strong>degradation of DNA methyltransferas</strong>e. By doing so, decitabine causes DNA hypomethylation. </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Tumor cell exposure to decitabine  causes the upregulation of cell cycle-associated genes, such as p14, p15 or p16, and genes related to the induction of apoptosis, suchas caspase-8 or Apaf-1, that are silenced by hypermethyl-ation. </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">As a consequence, demethylating agents <strong>induce </strong></span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"><strong>cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells and sensitize them to other chemotherapeutic drugs</strong>. The above explanations suggest that decitabine </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">may exert its antitumoral effect by both mechanisms,</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">dependent and independent of their demethylating action.</span></li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands reduces gene expression. <strong>Hypermethylation of CpG islands</strong> located in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes is  an important mechanism for <strong>gene inactivation</strong>.  Many cellular pathways are inactivated by this type of epigenetic lesion: DNA repair (hMLH1, MGMT), cell cycle (p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, p15<sup>INK4b</sup>, p14<sup>ARF</sup>), apoptosis (DAPK), cell adherence (CDH1, CDH13), detoxification (GSTP1), etc. Hypermethylation of  CpG islands have been found in colorectal cancers and leukemias. DNA methylation has plays a role in the aetiology of human neurodevelopmental syndromes such as the fragile X, ICF and Rett syndromes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
