    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally 70-80% of CpG dinucleotides are methylated, but CpG islands, often found at promoters of genes, tend to be protected from methylation.DNA Methylation is usually (not always) associated with repression of gene expression.<br />This repression usually happens by the formation of a repressive chromatin structure. More rarely, the methylation at CpG island blocks the binding of transcriptional factors. In cancer, CpG islands are usually hypermethylated.  <br />This leads to repression of the underlying gene, and is said to be correlated to cancer in two ways: the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, and the loss of function of Imprinting Control Regions (ICR).</p>
<p>On the opposite side, in cancer there's a general genome-wide loss of DNA methylation, achieved by deletion or mutation of DNMT1 and DNMT3b.This hypomethylation leads to increased gene expression from repetitive regions of DNA (leading to abnormal tissue development and a general genomic instability), again loss of imprinting in ICRs, activation of oncogenes,  and lastly activation of viral remnants in intergenic regions (piRNA or lncRNA coded as DNA) which can lead to genetic mutations. Demethylation of repetitive regions leads to genomic instability because different genes can have segments that are equal,and if there are no epigenetic markers to distinguish between them transposition of genetic material can happen.<br />Moreover, demethylations of repeats means that transcriptional factors have now many different seemingly equal sites to bind to, but of course the results of the transcription shall not be equal and deletions or insertions of genetic material will happen. I'll discuss ICRs in Q2.<br />piRNA  can directly cause mutations activating DNA reverse transcriptase, while the role of lncRNA is unclear in most cases  but has been proven for example to have a role in breast cancer, altering epigenetic marks in histones.<br /><br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks can be altered more easily than DNA itself, and, being mitotically heritable and designed to be stable during the lifetime of an organism, once altered they are just as efficient in promoting cancer. Imprinted genes are especially vulnerable to disruption of epigenetic marks because a change on just one allele is enough to break the whole mechanism. In the case of H19/Igf2 cluster, there's a cooperation of 3 sites, CTCF, H19 and Igf2.  CTCF and H19 are imprinted from the maternal allele, and Igf2 is imprinted from the paternal allele. On the <strong>maternal allele</strong>, CTCF blocks enhancers from accessing Igf2. They instead access H19, which mitigates the action of Igf2 on the paternal allele. On the <strong>paternal allele</strong>, CTCF and H19 are methylated, and enhancers can freely access Igf2. In <strong>Wilm's tumor</strong>, CTCF and H19 are <strong>methylated</strong> on both alleles, and therefore Igf2 is active on both the maternal and paternal side. The boosted action by Igf2 and the loss of growth-restricting genes cause the rapid cell growth that's caractheristic of all neoplastic tissues. These alterations have been found in early pre-neoplastic tissues</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As I said in Q2, epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable and designed to be stable during the lifetime of an organism. If epigenetic marks are modified (for example by drug treatment), modifications shall be kept in the subsequent generations of cells, because as a general rule the organism cannot "remember" what the "original" state of the markers is supposed to be. Drug treatment is inadvisable during "sensitive periods" (i.e. periods of extensive  re-setting and reprogramming of epigenetic marks during fetal life) because the  impact on fetus' health can be devastating.This resetting of epigenetic marks is mandatory in order to preserve the totipotency of germ cells. There are 2 such "sensitive periods": one is the pre-implantation period (from fertilization until the formation of the epiblast), the other is the period of primary germ cells development (which shall ultimately lead to oocytes or sperm)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating drug. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNMTs, which are bound irreversibly before reaching the DNA. Therefore it acts when the cell replicates. Since tumoral cells replicate quicker than healthy ones, it shall have a greater impact on tumoral cells than in healthy ones, even if the drug itself is <strong>non specific</strong> for tumoral cells.It's probably most effective in tumors with high CpG island hypermethylation (glioma, neuroblastoma, colorectal),reactivating anti-tumoral genes silenced by local hypermethylation. Since the drug is non tumor-specific and its long time effects are unknown, it is used preferably on elderly patients (70 years old and more) where replication of healthy cells is slow and therefore adverse effects are less likely to show. On the other side, its action shall be maximum on tumor, which replicates at a frantic speed.<a title="DNA methyltransferase" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methyltransferase"><br /></a></p></div>
