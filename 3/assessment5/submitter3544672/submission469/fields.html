In case there is a mechanism amplifying the DNA methylation (hypermethylation) at CpG islands, it may disrupts the control of gene transcription leading to silencing of gene promoters, which commonly occurs in cancerous cells. It is known that by wide through nearby genes, the CpG islands hypermethylation can promote silencing of tumors suppressor genes, thus contributing to impair the cell physiology and also leading to different types of diseases onset. With respect the hypermethylation at CpG islands, a lot of intergenic regions as well as repetitive elements neighboring this DNA-hypermethylated on the CpG islands, are affected by the genomic-wide phenomenon where several other important genes are strongly hypomethylated. This hypomethylation disturbs the control of genes expression; and the main features is a complex genomic instability that leads the organism to diseases output, as the main consequence.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-4f8ce543679d4299e32c26e6/970238/asst-5/970238-52083ac6807933.65774797.pdf">Writing assignment - (Q2).pdf</a><br />Monoallelic gene expression in imprinting cluster is strictly controlled at imprinting control regions (ICR) to silencing only one of the two alleles. Through DNA methylation just in paternal chromosome, the H19/Igf2 cluster is imprinted; whereas the DNA methylation blocks the biding of one specific insulator protein to paternal chromosome, which allows the Igf2 gene to be expressed just in paternal chromosome by direct action of enhancers, while H19 is silenced in the same chromosome. By the other hand, in maternal chromosome that does not display DNA methylation, the insulator protein biding to the maternal chromosome inhibiting the Igf2 expression, while the H19 expression is preferentially promoted by enhancers. It is important to keep in mind that disruption on the H19/Igf2 cluster leading to DNA hypermethylation on the ICR’s maternal chromosome, conducts the loss of imprinting alleles by blocks the insulator proteins biding in the maternal chromosome, as occurs in Wilm’s tumour. In this case, there is a double expression of Igf2 alleles (both in paternal and maternal chromosomes). Thus, the overexpression of Igf2 leads to physiological changes, that may disturbs other embryonic tissue functions promoting drastic human diseases, other than Wilm’s tumour.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-4f8ce543679d4299e32c26e6/970238/asst-5/970238-52083bcfbca324.96400262.pdf">Writing assignment - (Q3).pdf</a><br />Among several drugs that have become useful against some types of cancer, Decitabine that belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents is one important epigenetic inhibitor known by promoting the DNA hypomethylation. The Decitabine’s mechanism of action is responsible by the inhibition of the DNA methyltransferase. Thus, if in cancer status there is a disrupted chromosome region, in which DNA hypermethylation is signaling one uncontrolled cell growth by several upstream genes effected; the blockage of DNA methyltraferase by the action of Decitabine may blocks the DNA methylation, and therefore interfering on the signaling that stimulates the accelerated cell division/growth; thus displaying an important anti-cancer effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-4f8ce543679d4299e32c26e6/970238/asst-5/970238-52083d49db9606.39246086.pdf">Writing assignment - (Q4).pdf</a><br />Drugs that can alter the pattern of DNA methylation in cancer (by blocking the DNA methyltrasferase, for example) might display a long lasting effect on the epigenome. It may happen, because the epigenetic mark could be passed to daughter and granddaughter cells during cell division until all of the epigenetic changes (lack of DNA methylation in new daughter cells, for example) are completely erased in the subsequent daughter cells. In this case, when this epigenetic mark is erased it does not returns; which allows the cell lines alive without hypermethylation, even after the drug treatment. However, it is important to highlight that in developmental sensitivity periods, in which the early embryonic handling and primordial germ cells undergo the phenomenon of DNA methylation reprograming, the use of drugs that alter the pattern of DNA methylation (Decitabine, for example) does not should be indicate to treat patients; once it may drastically affect cell/individual healthy throughout life. Considering the process of DNA methylation reprograming is under high demethylation during the sensitive states of development, drugs such as Decitabine can promote a whole decline of DNA methylation and consequently the epigenetic reprogramming, so impairing the normal cell function.</span></span></p></div>
