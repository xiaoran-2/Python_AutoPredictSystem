    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that has a general purpose in silencing expression of genes with which it is associated.  Occurring specifically at CpG dinucleotides, DNA methylation happens in various places within the genome, including intergenic sites, intragenic sites, promoter sites most associated with CpG islands, and general areas containing dangerous repetitive elements whether in genes or not.  In healthy cells, CpG islands are rarely methylated.  If they are methylated, their position at promoters of genes would lead to silencing of genes the cell may need to activate.  In cancer, these CpG islands become hypermethylated.  This is an issue because the genes being silenced by methylation can be very important for the health of the cell.  If the gene is a tumor suppressor, as is often the case in cancer, the cell will lose an important product limiting the proliferation of cancer cells.</p>
<p>                The function of DNA methylation at intergenic sites and repetitive elements generally requires that a healthy cell maintain high levels of methylation at these sites.  The cell keeps these sites silenced in order to prevent their contributions to genomic instability and transcriptional errors.  Repetitive elements can transpose themselves throughout the genome, resulting in chromosomes and genes being interrupted, copied, or deleted.  This instability is dangerous and kept at a minimum via the silencing effects of methylation.  Other sites are kept silent to prevent transcriptional errors from competing promoter sites within introns and antisense promoters as well.  These elements interfere with the cell’s ability to produce healthy transcripts.  In cancer, these elements become hypomethylated.  The loss of methylation contributes to significant genomic instability leading to additional mutations that can progress the dysplasia of pre-cancer cells and cause more dangerous tumors via Knudson’s hypothesis (further hits causing accumulated destructive changes to oncogenes and tumor suppressors).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>                Imprinted genes in mammals often have an important role in the control of growth and development.  Therefore, changes in the methylation at imprint control regions (ICRs) are dangerous for a cell.  The H19/Igf2 cluster is an example where hypermethylation disrupts imprinting.  In this cluster, the paternal allele is methylated (imprinted).  The methylation of the paternal ICR results in the blocking of an insulator molecule called CTCF.  Blocking CTCF allows downstream enhancers to effectively activate the Igf2 gene.  This gene is active on the paternal allele and promotes growth.  The methylation at the ICR also spreads to the nearby H19 promoter, silencing this gene which functions to inhibit growth.  Overall, the paternal allele expresses a growth promoter and inhibits a growth inhibitor.  The maternal allele is not methylated, so CTCF does bind the ICR and prevents the enhancers from activating the Igf2 gene.   The maternal allele does not express the growth promoting Igf2.  It does express the H19 growth inhibitor.  In Wilm’s tumor, the maternal ICR is methylated, unlike normally, making it the same as the paternal allele. It will now also express Igf2.  This leads to overexpression of this growth promoter within the cell, causing excessive proliferation.    </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a drug which belongs to a class of DNA-demethylating agents.  The purpose of the drug is to inhibit the work of a class of epigenetic machinery called DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) that methylate and silence DNA.  As a nucleoside analogue, Decitabine is incorporated into DNA where it irreversibly binds DNMTs and prevents them from continuing to methylate the DNA.  It is replication dependent, as it does not directly remove methylation, but instead prevents renewal of methylation as the cell replicates DNA and then divides.  Reducing DNA methylation can prevent silencing of tumor suppressors, especially as pertains to accumulating hits via Knudson’s hypothesis.  Preventing further silencing of tumor suppressors can prevent the progression of myelodysplastic syndromes to acute myelogenous leukemia.  Being replication dependent, it is also worth noting that Decitabine and other DNMTi drugs are more effective in the treatment of cancers that replicate more.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The cell maintains stable DNA methylation marks through a DNA methyltransferase.  DNMTs maintain methylation by matching CpG dinucleotides that were methylated prior to replication.  A methylated CpG is mitotically heritable for life.  However, if one disrupts DNMTs with epigenetic drugs, replicated DNA will not receive methylation on the new strand.  Throughout multiple replications, methylation becomes diluted and potentially removed at that site. </p>
<p>The goal is to prevent silencing of tumor suppressor genes, though it affects others.  This can be dangerous because some methylation is desired.  The danger can be mitigated by avoiding sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming.  The two major sensitive periods occur in early embryonic development and germ cell development.  These are sensitive because chromosomes are being cleared of the marks needed in gametes and reprogrammed with marks for the developing organism.  Germ cells must be reprogrammed with imprinted marks appropriate to the sex of the parent.  If a patient is treated during pregnancy, when the embryo and primordial germ cells are vulnerable or during youth when germ cells are still being programmed, there could be side effects with desirable epigenetic mark establishment.  Older patients are less likely to see side effects as their cells are more completely and stably programmed.  Mainly proliferating cancer cells would be in danger.</p></div>
