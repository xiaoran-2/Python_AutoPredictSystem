    <div class="field-value"><p>The metilção of CpG islands acts controlling the expression of nearby genes. Such genes are silenced depending on the state, cell type and parental origin. Deregulation of this control system appears to be connected to the system with stochastic breaks mutations in regulatory enzymatic machinery. These errors arise during the life of the individual as a result of environmental stressors, for example, UV rays, or metabolic, e.g., oxidizing agents. Suggesting that cancer was a disease conducive for the elderly, since their cells would have spent more time on exposure to these agents. The fact that for some cancers is supported by studies. The breaking of this pathway causes aberrant  epigenetic control patterns of expression wich can result in loss of sensation of signals of cell growth restriction or overgrowing that  greatly influenced in part by loss of function of genes called tumor suppressors. The deregulation might be wide as demonstrated by the phenomenon of CpG shore where large extensions of the genome are affected starting on CpG island. In general methylation in the genome is losed in several genes in particular the genes known as oncogenes, that act by inducing the growth  and a locus specific hypermethylation in tumor suppressor genes resulting in loss of control of cell growth. Imprinted genes are also deregulated make up a double dose of a gene or silencing both genes. Genes in double dose also act to stimulate cell growth. Other genetic elements with high mutagenic potential, which are highly repeated in the genome, are also silenced as protection through methylation of their CpG islands. In cancer these elements are hipometilados leading to instability genomics by crossing overs aberrant between chromosomes not homologous, expression improper for promoter cryptic in these elements and disruption of genes for jump of this elements.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is located on chromosome 11 in the gene sequence we have Igf2, an ICR (Imprinting Control Region) and H19 gene. In the maternal chromosome the ICR is methylated which allows the binding of a CTCF insulator which insulates and prevents Igf2 enhancers located downstream to act in this gene allow to acting in H19. In the Father the ICR is unmetilated allowing enhancers act in Igf2 results in its expression and CpG island is methylated in the paternal H19 silencing it. Thus Igf2 is expressed on the paternal chromosome and H19 in the maternal. In the case of Wilm's tumors there is a loss of the standard conrole or by uniparentaldisomy in the case of paternal chromosome or disruption of epgenetic control. In this case the individual has overexpression of Igf2 plus loss of Cdk1nc. So, in this situation we have loss of action tumors suppressor gene (Cdk1nc) witn overexpression of oncogene (Igf2). In this child Contributes to arise tumors in the kidneys called wilm's tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In this paper several drugs are mentioned between these are Decitabine wich act in DNA-demethylation. So, lost of this epigenetic mark lead to activation for lost, for example, CpG methylation. In the cancer several tumour supressor genes are silenced by methylation in their CpG island so this genes may be go back to be expressed with decrease cancer cell overgrowing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation is the most important mark that is mitotically inheritable. It is first signal that lead the daughter cell behave how your mother cell. This way the tissue function is maintained after cell division. Lose this epigenetic mark is the first step to cell forget what it is. In cancer this mark is very disrupted. Drug that target this system are very promising but your use need to be very carefully mainly in periods where the epigenome are been reprogramed, periods sensitive. How in early embryonic development and germ cell development. In this case use of drugs that act in epigenome can propitiate epigenetics mutation and disruption that can lead to a series other problems or diseases.</p></div>
