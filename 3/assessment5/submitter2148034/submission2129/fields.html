    <h1>Submission 2129 from Anon (session_user_id: 74a8f88a1abd13dbb5304b95856a704d1ed5f33f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Deceitabine is used to treat a syndrome that is a precursor to leukemia and is a DNA demythylating agent. Aberrant DNA methylation can happen stochastically or through a mutation of epigenetic enzymes, typically by the hypermethylation of tumor suppressing genes.  A DNA demythylating drug would then reduce the methylation on these tumor suppressing genes thereby permitting the expression of these genes and having the result of reversing the tumor growth and having an anti tumor effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr Baylin observed patients treated with epigenetic drugs as having increased susceptibility to standard chemotherapy.  It is observed that epigentic  mechanisms impact genetic alteration through increased genome instability and aberrant DNA repair and in turn genetic alternation can alter epigentic modifications.  furthermore, there are different epigenetic layers that cansimultaneously reinforce and oppose cell functioning.  By altering DNA methylation in a cancer patient, then epigentic markers would permit the previously healthy genetic expression Of the genome And proper cell division. A sensitive period is a period of developmentnthat is susceptible to environmental signal.  Sensitive periods are window of development where a cells such as embryonic development or when sex cells are being created or when pluripotent markers are restored..  Another type of sensitive period is under stress when there is a higher chance for mutation or instability during cell division.  Many of these drugs are not appropriate for pregnant woman or children due to these sensitive periods, Or even specific phases of cancer development.  As the drugs have global impacts to epigenetic markers and could have many unintended and unknown consequences to gene expression and phenotype of the cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is a process in mammals where monoallelic parent of origin specific expression of a subset of genes. Typically, in a paternal allele with a methylated ICR (imprint control region) when H19 expression is decreased then the igf2 expression is increased, alternately  in the maternal allele the ICR will be unmethylated so the H19 expression is promoted.  In a Wilm's tumor the imprinting is relaxed such that the ICR is mythlated thus the maternal allele is expressing the same h19/igf2 arrangement as the paternal with the igf2 turned on and the H19 turned off to low levels.  This in turns results in increase cell growth.  Specifically the disrupting of the imprinting associated with h19/ and igf2 results in thetumor cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally DNA methylation is associated with the silencing of gene expression , however at CpG sites there is a higher percentage of gene promotion.  In cancer cells, hypermethylation is often found at the CpG islands, thereby silencing gene expression.  in some cases it is tumor suppressing genes that are silenced which permits uncontrolled growth of cells. This contributes to genomic instability such that the cell cycle is disrupted and DNA repair is impacted.  When large CpG sites are impacted by hypermethation, they are termed CIMP and are used to characterize tumor type and development And can be used as bio markers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. There is a wide range of heterogeneity in genome wide methylation patterns for various cancers.  Some repetitive elements that are disrupted in cancer are imprinting this contributes to the disease by permitting biallelic expression in regions that were mono allelic, such as Wilm'tumor. Altered nuclear morphology in cancer cells indicate rearrangement of global demethylatization and local hyper methylation at the cpG islands.  Transcription factors will then maintain this gene profile. Since epigenetic mechanism are associated with sensitive window that are plastic to environmental change, conditions such as chronic strests or toxic exposure can lead to these epigenetic changes that result in established cancerous genetic expressions. While DNA methylation is considered a stable epigenetic mark therefore maintained by  subsequent cells, reprogramming occurs typically after fertilization  or in gameogensis , but can also be  altered by specific stressors and environmental conditions As we see in cancer cell development. </p></div>
