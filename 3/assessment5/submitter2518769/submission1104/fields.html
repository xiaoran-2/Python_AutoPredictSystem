    <div class="field-value"><p>The biochemical process of adding a methyl group(-CH3) to a DNA nucleotide is called DNA methylation. It is known that in mammals DNA methylation happens almost exclusively to cytosines followed by guanines, the so called CpG dinucleotides. In  the DNA exist specific regions that contain a higher than normal frequency of CpG dinucleotides, that are called CpG islands, found in 60% of gene promoters. In normal cells CpG islands are usually umethylated but when methylation DOES occur it is leads to silencing of gene expression, due to a poor recognition by transcription factors.  In cancer cells on the other hand CpG islands are usually hypermethylated. CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes so methylation is an epigenetic way to inactivate tumor suppressor genes. Also DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so it is a very effective way of silencing. In contrast with genetic silencing (mutations) DNA methylation is reversible. Also 2kb sequences upstream and downstream of the CpG islands are hypermethylated in cancer cells, the CpG island shores.</p>
<p>In normal cells DNA methylation usually occurs in CpG dinucleotides located in intergenic regions and in repetitive elements. In both cases DNA methylation is used to prevent genomic integrity. In intergenic regions it silences cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. DNA methylation in repetitive elements maintains genomic stability by silencing repeats in order to prevent transposition, illegitimate recombination and to avoid transcriptional interference between promoters.  In cancer cells both intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, which of course leads to genomic instability. Genomic instability is achieved with illegitimate recombination between repeats, because they are no more densely packaged like in normal  cells due to hypomethylation, as well as with activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters normally inactivated in healthy cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is common in cancer cells to display loss of imprinting, caused either by hyper- or hypomethylation, concerning that imprinting genes are often associated with growth.</p>
<p>Concerning the H19/Igf2 cluster, in normal cells, the imprinting control region (ICR) is unmethylated in the maternal allele and methylated in the paternal allele. When the ICR is unmethylated, in the maternal allele, an insulator protein binds, CTCF. CTCF then insulates downstream enhancers from enhancing the expression of Igf2. The enhancers are now free to enhance the expression of H19, a long non-coding RNA. On the paternal allele that the ICR is mehylated, CTCF can no longer bind so the enhancers are able to enhance expression of Igf2. Therefore Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele (imprinted expression). The DNA methylation of the ICR in the paternal allele spreads downstream into the H19 promoter silencing its expression. So H19 can only be expressed from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor this cluster’s ICR in the maternal allele is hypermathylated as well so now it also expresses Igf2. So we have double dose of Igf2 and because Igf2 is a growth promoting gene it cause cells to multiply faster, acting as an oncogene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is known that establishment of aberrant DNA methylation patterns is associated with under- or overexpression of certain proteins often resulting to cancer. But unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic alterations, like DNA methylation, are reversible and so DNA methylation appears to be an interesting therapeutic approach. Using DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, like Decitabine,  is a valid antitumor approach, at least in AML. Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that is incorporated into th DNA upon replication. Once into the DNA the analogs are recognized by the DNMTs and undergo the same reaction as normal nucleosides. But analogs bind DNMT irreversibly, so it can no longer be released. At higher doses Decitabine is cytotoxic therefore it is used at low doses in order to achieve only the demethylation effect with little cytotoxicity. Because of the inhibitor’s division-dependent action the cancer cells, that are divdiding more rapidly than normal cells, will be more affected.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is known that DNA methylation patterns are mitotically and meiotically heritable.Normally DNA methylation patterns, like all epigenetic marks, are removed between generations to ensure totipotency for the new generation. Alteration in the DNA methylation patterns can cause this process to fail resulting in indeed enduring effects in the epigenome, causing a wide range of abnormalities from embryonic lethality to tumorgenesis or infertility.</p>
<p>By the term “sensitive periods” we’re defining periods of the development that we undergo active remodeling of the epigenome. At these periods we have removal or establishment of epigenetic marks at different parts in the whole genome, as they are then most sensitive to environmental changes. As sensitive periods are defined the germ cell development period and the early embryonic  development period. In such periods it is not recomended to supply drug treatment as the genome is really sensitive to changes in the enviroment, so establishment of aberrant epigenetic marks as sideeffect from the treatment is possible.</p></div>
