    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG Islands, strong promoters of gene expression, as a general rule are normally hypomethylated, which renders them active participants in gene expression. In disease processes such as cancer <em>CpG Island Hypermethylation</em> may result in silencing of gene expression. If this occurs in a gene that promotes tumor suppression proteins, for example, the cells may become less effected by WBC tagging and phagocytosis, T-cell deactivation or even cellular apoptosis, and thus promulgate a tumor/cancer. In addition, CpG Islands are mitotically heritable meaning damaged cell/gene structures will duplicate themselves and pass on these aberrant methylation patterns. This affinity for hypermethylation in cancer, a hallmark of virtually all cancer cells, also renders CpG Island Hypermethylation as a diagnostic tool because hypermethylation is easily determined via testing.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repeat elements, on the other hand, are normally highly methylated, rendering them as stabilizing structures in DNA/Chromosome replication/splicing, directing the splicing machinery, as in the intergenic regions, or copying and coding themselves into the gene, as with repeat elements. Hypomethylation of these structures may result in unwinding of normally densely packaged heterochromatin with resultant misalignment of the repeats and intergenic regions. This may cause aberrant splicing, inscription errors, and illegitimate recombinations of the repeats leading to gene mutation. This genome-wide hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repeat elements was the first epigenetic change noted in cancer cells in 1983.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 imprint control region is generally <em>unmethylated</em> on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele, meaning it is paternally imprinted. H19, a long noncoding RNA, is only expressed from the maternal allele and has a role in being a reservoir for a microRNA. The unmethylated ICR is bound by CTCF, a protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers allowing expression of <em>H19, a tumor suppressor</em>. Therefore H19 is only expressed from the maternal allele</p>
<p>The <em>methylated</em> ICR on the paternal allele restricts CTCF from binding to insulate Igf2 from the downstream enhancers and therefore <em>Igf2, a growth promoter</em>, is expressed from the paternal allele only. Because the DNA methylation at the ICR can spread downstream into the H19 promoter the methylation silences the CpG Island promoter of H19. </p>
<p>In Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) uniparental paternal disomy, both alleles inherited as paternal, occurs. This loss of imprinting causes disruptions effecting H19/Igf2 and Kcnq1 ICR clusters resulting in overexpression of Igf2, a growth promoter and lack of expression of H19 and Cdkn1c, both growth suppressors. Wilm’s Tumor, an embryonic or childhood renal carcinoma common in BWS, is often the end result as well as general fetal and neo-natal overgrowth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor that has been modified to produce a nucleoside analog effect. This means that it is incorporated into the DNA when it replicates and then later, when DNMT1 binds the nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand during replication, the DNMT1 is irreversibly bound and can no longer be released.  This may have its greatest effect by reducing CpG Island Hypermethylation, a hallmark of cancer and a poor prognosticator for myelodyplastic syndrome and lung cancer, in particular. Hypermethylation of the CpG Island and CpG island shore is associate with reduced expression of tumor suppressors. Improved efficiency of CpG Island and CpG Island shore demethylation, which is the goal with decitabine, may help improve tumor suppressor gene expression, thus inhibiting tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation treatment’s long-lasting effects may be due in part to mitotic heritability causing a transgenerational effect or “permanent” genetic expression in tumors reducing the protective mechanisms inherent in all cancer cells. This effect would be amplified as cell division increases the mass of susceptible cell lines.</p>
<p>This effect, however, may be of concern when this type of treatment is applied during the periods of 1) fetal development, e.g. during the sensitive developmental stages of pre-implantation and post-implantation of the zygote and 2) during primordial germ cell development through full maturity of the eggs or sperm cells of an individual. The peri-conceptual period as well as the period from 9-12 years old in males and 8-10 years old in females are especially susceptible to environmental effects as described in the Overkalix and Dutch Famine studies.</p>
<p>Treating patients during these sensitive periods could interfere with such processes as active imprinted X chromosome clearing and the effects of biomodulation on primordial germ cells during sensitive periods could result in birth defects as a result of gene mutation, unexpected epigenetic disease processes or interrupted or altered metabolic and biological functions in subsequent generations.</p></div>
