    <h1>Submission 441 from Anon (session_user_id: 7bb09e3c552219ca17d61376233017ad127202c5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor that belongs to a class of DNA-demethylating agents, i.e. agents that remove the methylation marks from the DNA thus allowing genes to be re-expressed. In cancer, the tumor supressor genes (which supress tumor growth) are silenciated. DNA-demethylation agents remove the silence marks (DNA methylation at CpG islands) on these genes, and further methylation is prevented, allowing their normal expression and therefore have an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering the DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome due to its mitotic heritability performed by DNMT1 that methylates hemi-methylated DNA (DNA methylated only on the parental strand from replication). A sensitive period is a period when external factors have the most impact in the development. The sensitive periods are during the pre-implantation development and during the primordial germ cells development, during this periods there is epigenetic reprogramming i.e removal of the methylation (for imprinting genes it only happens during the primordial germ cells development). Treating patients during the sensitive periods is not advisable because these are periods of heavy methylation reestablishment. Drugs that affect the DNA methylation will likely disrupt the epigenetic reprogramming that can result in serious health conditions during the life time.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression, the hypermethylation of the CpG islands results in the condensation of the chromatin by several factors recruited by the MeCP proteins. Methylation of lysine 9 and 27 residues of histone H3 (H3K9me and H3K27me) as well as demethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4) and deacethylation, also contribute to chromatin condensation that prevents the gene's transcription, thus silencing it. The hypomethylation at CpG islands is therefore associated with gene expression.</p>
<p>In normal cells we can also observe DNA hypermethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements thus preventing genome instability. </p>
<p>In cancer there is hypermethylation of DNA at CpG islands especially at tumor suppressor genes, therefore silencing their expression and promoting tumor growth. In cancer there is also hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, this contributes to disease because they can cause abnormal chromossome combinations and can active surronding genes, or alter their expression levels having harmful effects on the genome.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, for example on the H19/Igf2 cluster the maternal allele is not methylated at the ICR (imprint control region) and therefore there is binding of the CTCF protein to this region. This protein will prevent the enhancers (found downstream) from acting on the Igf2 gene. The enhancers are then able to act on H19 gene and promoting its expression. On the paternal allele we can find methylation at the ICR thus preventing the binding of the CTCF to this region allowing the action of the enhancers on the Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumor is a result of a loss of imprinting, in this case there is hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele preventing the binding of CTCF and therefore promoting the overexpression of the Igf2. </p>
<p>Many imprinted genes are related to cell growth, Igf2 gene is a growth promoter that means that its overexpression (expression from both maternal and paternal alleles) will result in uncontrolled cell growth (Wilm's tumor). </p></div>
