    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is important to the differentiation of tissue, and the neutralization of harmful DNA that can be inserted into the genome by viral/phage transfer.  Methylation, typically, is linked to a reduction of expression in the methylated genes.  </p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated when compared to normal tissue. This leads to loss of imprinting, and decreased expression of the normal gene product.  However, the remainer of the gene and the intergeneic regions are hypomethelyated when compared to normal tissue.  This means that the intergenic and the intergenic regions are more likely to be expressed, leading to disease phenotypes.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is the activation of one allele, and the inactivation of another (i.e. only having one active autosome in the nucleus).  In the maternal allele, the H19 is expressed (because it remains unmethylated) leading to normal expression of growth restricting genes, and normal expression of insulin growth factor 2.  The paternal allele has hypermethylation of the Imprinting control region (the ICR) which inactivates the H19 expression and leads to overexpression of insulin growth factor 2.  When imprinting is disrupted in neoplastic tissue, there is overexpression of this growth factor (and often, DNA is imprinted to help limit the double dose expression of growth factors).  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor, and a nuceloside analogue.  It gets incorporated into the DNA as a base, and when the DNA is copied, it irreversibly biinds the DNA Methyltransferase (enzyme that methylates the nucleotides).  By preventing the methylation of the nucleosides, the cell is less likely to behave in a malignant fashion.  Initially, it was given in very high doses, where the effect on the cells was directly toxic, but in the lower doses, the effect is more specific to DNA methylation and better tolerated by the patients.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>While the drugs are effective, changing methylation status could alter the cells in the body in a way that would lead to either increased or decreased expression of genes over the long term in an organism (in the case of cancer treatment, a cancer patient).  A sensitive period is a time when epigenetic marks are being activiely laid down.  They occur during fetal development and during the pre-teen years when the gametes are developing and maturing actively.  If you were to alter the ability of the organism to place epigenetic marks during the sensitive period, individuals could develop aberrant gametes (affecting the next 2 generations, depending on the period).</p></div>
