    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">CpG islands are found at the promoters of the genes. When a CpG island methylated it means that the gene is silenced.</p>
<p lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">In normal cells the CpG islands are not methylated but in cancer cells they are methylated. Hypermethylation on CpG islands are common in tumor, but it varies by tumor type. Not just the CpG islant, but the 2kb upstream and downstream regions are also hypermethylated  (CpG island shores).</p>
<p lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">Methylation in CpG islands of tumor supressor genes is extremely frequent in tumors. This occurs lower expression of tumor supressors and more rapid cell division. DNA methylation pattern of CpG islands can be used to diagnosis of cancer.</p>
<p lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">DNA methylation in the intergenic regions accurs genomic stability in the chromosome, it obstruct deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. In the repetitive elements the function of the methylation is the same: it obstructs that the repetitive elements paste somewhere else in the genome (transposition).</p>
<p lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">In normal cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. In cancer cells they are hypomethylated. Genom wide hypomethylation happens in early tumorgenesis. It is most commonly occuring in repeats.</p>
<p lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">Hypometilation of repetitive elements couse genomic instability, because hypomethilated regions are not heterochromatonized and recombination between repeats can more often happen. Hypomethilation can also result transposition of different parts of the genome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">The imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele (paternally imprinted) and CTCF insulator protein can't bind. In this case the downstream enhancers can bind Igf2, and promote Igf2 expression. Igf2 exress only from the paternal allele.</p>
<p lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">The imprinting controll region is unmethylated on the maternal allele.  When it is unmethylated, the CTCF insulator protein binds the control region. In this case the the downstream enhancers can act with H19. H19 is a long-noncoding protein which expressed only from the mathernal allele.</p>
<p lang="hu" xml:lang="hu"><span>The imprint control region is     hypermethylated in the mathernal and paternal allele as well. Both of the     alleles have expression of Igf2. This cause double dose of Igf2 than in     normal cells</span><span>.</span></p>
<p lang="hu" xml:lang="hu"><span>This cause double dose of Igf2 than in normal cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating drug. It is a nucleoside analog.</p>
<p>Decitabine inhibits DNA     methyltransferase. It is a replication dependent drug. When the cell     replicating, Decatibine irreversibly binds DNMTs. It's incorporates into     the DNA during the replication, and when the methyltransferase comes along     to bind it, it binds to the DNA irreversibly  and can no longer be released.</p>
<p>It is not clear why it has effect on myeloid leucemia, its mechanism of action is unclear. It used in a low concentration and have very good succes in th threatment of myeloid leucemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

    <div class="field-value"><p lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">DNA methylation is transgenrationally heritable , so the methylation pattern of the parents has affect to the  childrens and grandchildrens</p>
<p lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">In the sensitive periods in the developement the enviroment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup<span>.</span></p>
<p lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">Thefirst  sensitive periods is the primodial germ cell developement (mature egg and sperm cell production). The preimplantation and early postimplantation period is the second sensitive period. In these periods the epigenomic pattern remodelling.</p>
<p lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">Any changes in the crithical periods in the epigenetic control csan have influence to the health of the children and grandchildren.</p></div>
