    <div class="field-value"><p>It is discussed in week 1 lecture # 5 that DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the DNA.  When the methyl group is added, it attaches to the cytosine.  In mammals, the mehtylation takes places mainly at "CS" that are followed by G's.  This is called the CpG dinucleotide.  The "p" represents the phosphate that bonds the two.  During DNA methyl transferees, enzymes lay down methyl marks to convert unmethylated DNA to methylated DNA which allows for the DNA to be copied from parent to daughter cells.  All this occurs at the CpG and the CpG is found on the CpG island.  </p>
<p>It is discussed in week 1 lecture # 6 DNA methylation is a regulator of gene transcription and is also mutagenic.  During this process, "abberant DNA methylation patterns-hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue-have been associated with a large number of human malignancies.  "Hypermethylation usually takes place at the CpG island in the promoter and is connected with gene inactivation.Hypomethylation has also been implicated in the develpment and progression of cancer through different mechanisms. Although methylation can occur at the CpG island, they tend to be unmethylated.  However, at the areas where there is methylation are intergenic intervals and repetative elements. The funciton of methylation at the intergenic region and the repetative elements are to maintain genomic integrity.  The repetative elements make copies of themselves.  These repeats need to be silenced to prevent transciptional interference from strong promoters.  If this process was left untouched, unmethylation would be present causing genome instability. The DNA methylation is hypomethylated at the intergenic intervals and the repetative elements tend to lead to genomic instability. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Based on week 4 lecture 2, ICRs bring about slilencing of gene expression.  Menthylation does not neccesarily correlate eith silencing of gene expression.  Mechanisms of action of the ICR varies with each cluster. The presences of methylation determines which allele will possess activity in ICR. Methylation at ICR is methylated determines imprinting type in combination of cluster type and its workings. When Kcnq1 cluster at  ICR is methylated silencing occurs (tumour suppressor.) So with the H19 (long non-coding RNA)/Igf2 cluster,  when the H19 is unmethylated it binds to the CTCF which insulates Igf2. When Igf2 is insulated, enhancers are free to act on H19 and enhance H19 expression on particular allele. When bound by CTCF, it becomes an insulator to Igf2 which then allows H19 to be expressed. However, if CTCF is not bound then Igf2 can be expressed. Determination of this depends on which allele there is activity...maternal/paternal.  Imprint disorder at H19/Igf2 identifies with a loss of Cdkn1c which disrupts the Igf2, promoting overgrowing.  At this point patients can be subjected to embryonic or childhood tumours, such as Wilms tumour which results in imprinting loss,overexpression of growth promoting genes or loss of those gene suppressors.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According to the article "<em>Cancer's epicentre,</em>" Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetics of DNA-demethylating agents .  These agents showed in combination with a  histone-deacetylase inhibitor, tumour growth slowed in some patients with lung caner in the later stages.  This was the first time epigenetic drugs had successfully battled a solid tumour.  Those who did not show promise during the trial went on to show a good response to routine chemo treatment.  It is felt that the epigenetic drugs changed the tumour cells in some lasting way that made these cells more sensitive to standard treatments of chemo.</p>
<p>It also seems that unlike other forms of gene regulation, "epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and grand daughter cells until they are actively erased..." without returning.  So therefore, it might be considered that epigenetic therapies can affect changes which stop cancer growth without killing all its cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According to the <em><strong>Economist article</strong></em>, Dr. Stephen Baylin speculates that the drugs that are used for the treatment of cancer affect the epigenetic changes and are passed on during cell division to further generations until they are erased.  In research it was found that the amount of histone overmethylation decreased substantially when treated with an inhibitor.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of development when the environment has the biggest influence on the epigenetic makeup of the cell, which include the primordial germ cell development through the maturation of eggs/sperm and also preimplantation and postimplantation.  Somatic maintenance period seems to be periods of least sensitivity.</p>
<p>Since the development of a cell and the divisions it goes through at the sensitive periods, during the primordial germ cell development through the preimplantation/postimplantation phase, is so critical for the survival and health of the embryo treating patients during this time would not be a good idea.  The introduction of epigenetic drugs would affect the cell and alter the productive changes of the cell from that it would either not survive or produce an unhealthy embryo during the treatment of the patient with cancer. During the somatic maintenance period it seems to be the least sensitive period.  Treating during this phase would be less dangerous than the other phases discussed.</p></div>
