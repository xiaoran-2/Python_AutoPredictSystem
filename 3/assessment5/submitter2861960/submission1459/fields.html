    <div class="field-value"><p>For supporting gene expression, CpG islands (CGI) are unmethylated at gene promoters for the binding of the transcription machinery (hypomethylated CGI). Small subsets of CGI are dynamically methylated between cell types for silencing gene expression at inactive X chromosomes.</p>
<p>The locus specific DNA hypermethylation at promoter CGI and CGI shores of tumour suppressor genes causes silencing of the underlying silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer (CGI hypermethylation). In contrast, the genome-wide hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can result in oncogene activation.</p>
<p>Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, DNA methylation is a very good locking down mechanism regarding epigenetic silencing. Therefore, CGI hypermethylation occurs frequently in tumours and progresses with time. Additionally, epimutations are rapidly selected and reversible, unlike gene mutations.</p>
<p>The normal cell genome is generally methylated in repetitive elements and intergenic regions for silencing gene expression. This gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated that DNA methylation may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, repetitive elements and intergenic regions are generally hypomethylated, which leads to genomic instability. This hypomethylation results from illegitimately recombining repeats and activating repeats and transpositions. Additionally, cryptic promoters are activated and neighbouring genes are disrupted as well. Genome-wide hypomethylation occurs to some degree in all tumour types tested and progresses with tumorigenicity.</p>
<p>Depending on the context, the disruption of DNA methylation can enhance or suppress tumorigenesis. The depletion of DNA methylation appears to suppress tumorigenesis in tumours driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation. In contrast, the depletion of DNA methylation appears to enhance tumorigenesis in tumours driven by chromosomal instability. Additionally, the depletion effect can be stage specific in tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinted control region (ICR) is unmethylated on the maternal allele. The DNA methylation at ICR of the paternal allele (paternally imprinted) blocks binding of CTCF. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to the promoter of the long noncoding RNA H19 to silence. Enhancers can access Igf2 to activate Igf2's expression only from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>The binding of an insulator protein called CTCF at the unmethylated ICR of the maternal allele is able to insulate Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. By insulating Igf2, these enhancers are now free to enhance H19 expression on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, which is found in the kidney, both alleles act as the original paternal allele with a hypermethylated ICR. This results in Igf2 overexpression and consequently in loss of imprinting. Many imprinted genes are involved in growth. Therefore, this predisposition occurs in embryonic or childhood tumours, but not in adult tumours.</p>
<p>The disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster (hypo- or hypermethylation) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and in overexpression of growth promoting genes. The loss of imprinting is observed in various tumor types in an early event, often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analog, which belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. Upon replication, it got incorporated into the DNA. Recently, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors have been used at much lower doses in the specific range in which they cause DNA demethylation without severe toxic side effects for patient’s health. A very good anti-neoplastic effect to tumour cells was obtained.</p>
<p>When a DNA methyltransferase binds to Decitabine, it will copy the methylation to the daughter strand for maintaining the DNA methylation. In this case, this DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it cannot be released again. The effect of these DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is cell division dependent and requires cell replication.</p>
<p>Cancer cells with more rapid cell replication will be more severely affected by Decitabine than most other body cells. Drugs which inherit Decitabine are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes, like altering DNA methylation, may have the potential to affect all dividing cells to some extent. It is not known what the long term consequences would be on normal cells, because most cells will divide at some point. Unlike other forms of gene regulation, epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable until they are actively erased. Epigenetic therapies can effect changes, which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p>During the sensitive period of germ cell development, epigenetic marks are being (re-)established respectively reprogrammed for the further cell development.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods of development are the early development, the primordial germ cell development and the later specific stages of cell differentiation.</p>
<p>During sensitive periods, cancer can result from a single cell with an uncorrected error. The specificity inherent to the mechanism of action by epigenetic drugs is still unclear - especially for long term effects on normal cells that last beyond the period of drug treatment. A drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery could take one very large insult to the environment, particularly those affecting developing germ cells of younger patient in sensitive periods. </p></div>
