    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p> DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. In normal cells CpG islands are in general hypomethylated allowing gene transcription and securing genomic stability. In contrast, in cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, they are not all methylated but most of them are more likely to be. This pattern of methylation is seen in promoters of tumor supressor genes rising to their epigenetical inactivation which is one of the main characteristics of cancer, the second hit to happen in order that cancer happens. </p>
<p>In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated whereas in contrast, in cancer cells these regions are hypomethylated. This hypomethylation leads to genetic instability because it allows illegitimate recombination between repeats to happen. Normally methylated intergenic region and repetitive elements are heterochromatized preventing recombination whereas in the context of cancer where these regions are hypomethylated and therefore euchromatized, recombination occurs easy resulting in an abnormal karyotype. Also the hypomethylation of repeats results in their activation so either they become actively transribed or  they start jumping around in the genome and being transposed in genomic regions where this results in disruption of genes.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR (imprint control region) of the Igf2/H19 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele in a normal cell. When it is unmethylated (maternal allele) it allows CTCF to bind on the ICR so that the enhancers will act on the H19 band the IgF2 will be silent from the maternal allele and not expressed. On the paternal allele ICR is methylated so the enhancers will act on the IgF2 which will be expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>But in the case of cancer, loss of imprinting happens in a wide variety of tumors, so then there is hypermethylation of both ICRs (paternal and maternal allele) and there is expression of IgF2 also from the maternal allele, resulting in double dose of growth promoting IgF2, comparing to a normal cell. This is exactly the case with Wilm's tumor, a kidney childhood tumor, where IgF2 is expressed from both parental alleles causing cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span>Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent, a DNA methylatetransferase inhibitor,</span> used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (a group of conditions in which the bone marrow produces blood cells that are misshapen and does not produce enough healthy blood cells). Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Many genes become transcriptionally silenced during the development of cancer. Aberrant methylation of CpG islands in promoters is associated with transcriptional inactivation of genes involved in all aspects of tumour development. Since the DNA sequence of epigenetically inactivated genes are not mutated but rather subject to reversible modifications via DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) or histone modification, it is possible to reverse silencing using small molecule inhibitors such as Decitabine. </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs altering DNA methylation are nucleoside analogs that incorporate into the DNA upon replication and when the cell is divided and DNA is replicated DNMT inhibitor is binded on the DNA irreversibly and this alteration passes on to the next generation ensuring that the drug effect will be long lasting. Sensitive periods of development are those when the epigenetic profile of an organism's genome is established such as<span> gametogenesis, the period after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. In o</span>ne of these periods, the germ cells development in young people, the use of epigenetic drugs would be inadvisable because they would alter the normal epigenetic profile of the germ cells which is critical to be stable and not get disrupted.</p></div>
