    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">DNA methylation occurs in both normal and cancerous cells.  In normal cells DNA methylation is prevalent at the intron, intergenic and repetitive elements which imparts genomic integrity; whereas the CpG islands are unmethylated.  <span>CpG islands tend to be clustered around promoters where the transcription machinery binds, thus unmethylated CpG islands allow this machinery to bind and function.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">There is a genome wide lack of methylation in cancer.  This can involve activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumour suppressor genes.   Methylation can ulimately silence these tumour suppressor genes.  In cancer, hypomethylation occurs at intergenic regions and repeats that results in genomic instability </span></span><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;">due to mechanisms such as loss of imprinting and reactivation of transposable elements.  </span><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;">In cancer cells global hypomethylation is due to disruption in DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">In cancer the <span style="color:#000000;">CpG islands</span> are hypermethylated and this hypermethylation progresses with time and increasing age. This methylation results in silencing of the associated gene including genes that regulate the cell cycle. This allows cells to grow and reproduce uncontrollably eventually leading to tumorgenesis.  The methylated CpG island results in a compacted chromatin structure.  DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine) occurs at CpG dinucleotides and is maintained through cell division. Methylation is accomplished by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT3a and DNMT3b).  DNA methylation is maintained by the DNMT1 enzyme.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena including the formation of heterochromatin </span></span><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;">CpG islands which are found in about 60% of promoters.  Frequent hypermethylation of sets of CpG islands is also noted in colorectal , gliomas, and neuroblastoma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:large;">Epigenetic changes do not change the DNA sequence, however, they can cause mutations.  In fact, nearly half of the genes that cause inherited forms of cancer are turned off by methylation.  The majority of these genes usually suppress tumour formation and aid in the repair of DNA.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">In epigenetics, </span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">altered methylation patterns have been associated with diseases such as cancer</span></span></span><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">.  </span></span></span><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">Baylin conducted a study in which some of the participants who did not respond to treatment for advanced lung cancer (using an epigenetic drug combination) were found to perform better in later chemotherapy.  It was believed that these drugs epigenetically altered the tumour cells overtime and as a result ultimately provided encouraging results in subsequent chemotherapy. It was reasoned that epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division (to daughter and granddaughter cells) until they are eventually erased.  Once erased they do not return. </span></span></span><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">  </span></span></span><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;color:#000000;">It may be possible that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop cancer from </span><span style="font-size:large;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;color:#000000;">growing without having to kill all its cells.  <span><span><span>During sensitive periods </span></span></span><span><span><span>where</span></span></span><span><span><span> epigenetic reprogramming can occur (such as primordial germ cell development - PGC) </span></span></span><span><span><span>results in</span></span></span><span><span><span> a decrease in the amount of DNA </span></span></span><span><span><span>methylation, <span>but sequences that carry long-term epigenetic markers (imprints, CGIs, germline-specific genes) only become demethylated upon entry of PGCs into the gonads.  </span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:large;">In the case of younger patients these cancer drugs have the potential to effect every cell so you need to worry about germ cells during sensitive periods which can affect their epigenetic machinery.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">Decitabine (DNMTi) is a commercialized drug that is currently utilized to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which eventually proceed to acute myelogenous leukaemia.  From a mechanistic perspective the decitabine, at low doses, can inhibit the DNA methyltransferase enzyme which then results in hypomethylation of the DNA.  By a second mechanism, via incorporation of decitabine into the DNA at higher doses, results in cell death.  DNA methyltransferases cause DNA methylation using S-adenosyl  methionine (SAM).  In cancer there is hypermethylation of the DNA at CpG islands; the inhibition of this process can provide an anti-tumour effect.  Incorporation of decitabine into DNA will result in covalent binding to the DNA methyltransferases leading to cell death.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">In the case of genomic imprinting certain genes can be expressed in a parent of origin specific fashion.  Imprinted alleles are silenced such that the </span></span><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">genes are either expressed only from the non-imprinted allele inherited from either the mother or the father. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">Imprinting has also been linked to cancer.</span></span><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"> In the case of Wilm's tumour</span></span><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"> (</span></span><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">embryonic kidney cancer) that involves th</span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">e </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">IGF2/H19 cluster.  H19 is a non-coding RNA which is known to repress growth.  It is also </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">expressed </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">from the maternal copy.  IGF2 is an insulin growth factor</span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"> that is highly expressed in certain tumours.  In this case, the paternal copy of IGF2 is expressed.  In a normal cell the maternal H19 is unmethylated while the paternal H19 is methylated.  In Wilm's tumour the maternal and paternal H19 is methylated. Modification of DNA methylation at ICRs can result in a loss of imprinting.  </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">The function of H19 is to turn-off the expression of IGF2.  Loss of H19 function </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">(maternal) </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">by DNA methylation results in overexpression of IGF2 (double dose) leading ultimately to tumour formation.</span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"> This is due to the fact that H19 functions to slow tumour growth and IGF2 induces cell growth.</span></span></span></p></div>
