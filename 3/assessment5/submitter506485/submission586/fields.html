    <h1>Submission 586 from Anon (session_user_id: fbfb46b04ab8837cdb727d1b771f991299050154)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine  belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors which inhibits DNA methylation. Decitabine is thus a <em>DNA-methyltransferease inhibitor.</em></p>
<p>Decitabine acts to inhibit DNA methylation. <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">It is a nucleoside analog. Upon administration, it gets incorporated into the DNA during during replication.</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">After replication, DNMT1, which is a maintenance methyltransferase, comes to copy the methylation pattern onto the daughter strand, but is unable to do so. Due to Decitabine, the DNMT1 remains bound and is not released. Over a period of several cell divisions, <em>genome-wide DNA methylation levels go down. </em>Tumours, being rapidly dividing are thus vulnerable to the effects of this drug.</span></p>
<p>Decitabine has got anti-tumour effect against myelodysplastic syndrome which has hypermethylated CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes(Lecture 6.9). By inhibiting DNA methylation, hypermethylation at CpG islands may be removed , thereby reactivating the tumour suppressor genes to curb the tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark. Patterns of CpG methylation are faithfully copied to daughter strands after every cell division via DNMT1. In normal cells, the high fidelity of DNMT1 helps maintain stable methylation patterns. In cancerous cells, the same DNMT1 maintains abnormal methylation pattern. Hence, altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects even after the cessation of a drug like Decitabine.</p>
<p>It may be prudent to avoid such treatment during certain sensitive periods. These are the periods of primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation embryo. These periods of development are called senstive periods because the entire epigenome undergoes reprogramming and there is resetting of epigenetic marks, especially DNA methylation during these periods.</p>
<p>DNA methyltransferase inhibitors will restrict availability of DNMT1 leading to failure to pass methylation marks to daughter cells.Failure to properly re-establish DNA methylation can have fatal effects including failure to differentiate, loss of imprinting and genomic instability. Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation could occur which is essentially a cancerous phenotype. Furthermore, hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters could activate oncogenes, again leading to a cancerous phenotype. Administration of such drugs during these periods can possibly lead to such effects. As such, the foetus may die and the woman may suffer a miscarriage.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are clusters of CpG dinucleotides occurring in close proximity. In normal cells, CpG islands are <em>protected</em> from DNA methylation. (Lecture 1.5). A small subset of CpG islands are dynamically methylated between cell types. Furthermore, CpG islands often occur in promoters and are hypomethylated. Thus, if methylation occurs at CpG island, silencing of gene expression occurs.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated especially those of tumour suppressor genes, thereby silencing them. Due to this, cancer cells are able to proliferate unhindered resulting in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, different cancers have different CpG island(CGI) methylation. The genes having such hypermethylated CGI can be used biomarkers for diagnosis &amp; prognosis of a particular type of cancer. Additionally, CIMP (CpG Island Methylator Phenotype) has been described where CGI of a group of genes are frequently methylated &amp; they can be used as a panel of biomarkers.</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation at CGI can lead to loss of imprinting resulting in various diseases like Prader-Wili syndrome,Beckwith-Weidemann syndrome etc.This happens due to loss of ICR(Imprint Control Region) due to hyper/hypo methylation. DNA methylation at CGI is also required for maintaining random X-inactivation(Lecture 1.5) &amp; its disruption could negatively affect maintenance of random X-inactivation. </p>
<p>Intergenic regions &amp; repetitive elements,are usually methylated &amp; this serves to maintain genomic integrity by preventing transposition via silencing of cryptic TSS &amp; splice sites, preventing reciprocal translocations, insertions, deletions &amp; whole chromosome duplications. Transposition is also prevented due to mutagenic nature of DNA methylation wherein meC ---&gt; T.</p>
<p>In cancer, DNA methylation is altered as hypomethylation occurs at intergenic regions &amp; repetitive elements. Due to this there is increased genomic instability as the cryptic promoters get activated and retrotransposons are free to move around, resulting in illegitimate recombinations. There is increased occurrence of insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocations.</p>
<p>Since majority of genome comprises of repeats, hypomethylation, in addition to causing genomic instability, also results in a more open chromatin, allowing frequent chromosome wide translocations. This contributes to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the ICR(Imprint Control Region) for H19/Igf2 cluster is <em>methylated. </em>Due to this, the insulator CTCF is unable to bind to it and thus, there is no enhancer blocking. The enhancers, located downstream of the ICR have access to Igf2 located upstream of ICR. Hence<em> Ig2 is expressed</em>.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the ICR for H19/Ig2 cluster is <em>unmethylated. </em>Due to this, this the insulator CTCF binds to the ICR, which blocks enhancer access to Igf2. The enhancers now access H19 located downstream of the ICR and so H19 is expressed.<em> Igf2 is not expressed.</em></p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele is also methylated. Hence, no CTCF binds, the enhancers have access to Igf2 and it is expressed. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene. Since the maternal allele is methylated, no H19 is produced. The Igf2 concentration is twice the normal amount. Due to this, tumorigenesis occurs and Wilm's tumour is formed.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster results in a specific disease called Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. In this syndrome, the Cdkn1c gene, which is tumour suppressing located upstream of the H19/Igf2 cluster gets silenced due to loss of methylation at Kcnq1 cluster. The ICR for matenral H19/Igf2 is also methylated &amp; these combined effects cause the syndrome.</p></div>
