    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>1. In normal cells, CpG islands are methylated in repetitive elements, in intergenic regions to while are demethylated in promoters, probably to allow transcription of specific genes (ex. onco-suppressors)</p>
<p>2. The overall asset of methylation is altered in cancer cells: low level of methylation in repetitive elements and introns and highly methylated in promoters. Globally, CpG islands are highly methylated in cancer cells.  </p>
<p>3. DNA methylation varies considerably among the different type of cancer. The CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype) is an iportant hallmark and involves differently methylated genes. Altough this considerations, CpG methylation was found to silence important onco-suppressors genes, specific for cancer type. The CpG hypermethylation was found in gene-promoters like RB in retinoblastome, MLH1 in colorectal cancer, BRCA1-2 in breast cancer and MGMT in gliomes and colorectal tumors. All these genes are fundamental for controlling the outcome of cancer phenotype.   </p>
<p>4. DNA methylation is fundamental in repetitive elements and intergenic regions. The methylation in these elements is essential for avoiding abnormal kariotypes and for mantaining genomic integrity. Silencing of these regions prevent the activation of transposable elements, illegitimate ricombination due to multiple repeats and avoids transcriptional interference from intergenic promoters.</p>
<p>5. Abnormalities in cancer cells are more likely to happen due to the poor methylation status in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>6. The transcription of repetitive elements and itergenic regions lead to a genomic instability beceuse of several mechanisms. Hypomethylated repeats lead to illegitimate recombination between chromosomes, activation of transposones that could destroy normal activity of genes through insertion. Intergenic hypomethylation activates cryptic promoters and disrupts rear  but functionally important genes.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. Paternal H19/Igf2 allele cluster is methylated in the inner locus and in the H19 promoter. In this way methylation deters insulator protein, CTFC, from binding to the inner locus. The missing protein attachement leads to the upstream Igf2 activation, made possible by downstream enhancers elements. </p>
<p>2. Maternal H19/Igf2 allele cluster is unmethylated in the inner locus and in the H19 promoter. Insulator CTFC protein binds to the inner site and avoids DNA looping as in the maternal allele. In this way enhancers can only activate the near H19 gene but not reaching the far lgf2 upstream gene, as in the paternal allele.</p>
<p>3. The altered imprinting in H19/lgf2 cluster is demonstrated to be the cause of the Wilm's tumor. Individuals with Wilm's tumor show the paternal methylation pattern also on the maternal allele. The main outcome is the missing H19 expression and the double dose expression of lgf2 gene.</p>
<p>4. The disease, due to imprinting disruption, is the outcome of the highly expressed lgf2 gene: this gene induces cell proliferation, tipical in cancer process. In normal cells lgf2 oncogene dosage is controlled by the imprinting process.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. Decitabine is an epigenetic droug and belongs to the DNMT inhibitors.</p>
<p>2. Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent and is a cytosine-nucleoside analogous. This droug inhibits methylation enzymes and reduces the CpG hypermethilation.</p>
<p>3. Decitabine is discovered to be active in <span>myelodysplastic syndromes, a precursor of leukimia. Acting against the CpG hypermethylation, specifically in tumor cells and at low dosage, is possible to normalize methylation in a way to activate regulatory genes silenced in in cancer cells.  </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. Even if epigenetics modifications are reversible, they are stable genetics marks and pass to next generation cells. Altering the DNA methylation than is an enduring and stable effect because of the nature of this epigenetic modification.</p>
<p>2. A sensitive period is when epigenetics modifications are usually to occur. Sensitive periods are those that undergo complete methylation resetting followed by methylation remodelling.</p>
<p>3. Sensitive periods are 2 in the early embryo development: -Preimplantation blastocyst period, around 5 days after fertilization; - Primordial germ cells develoment, around 7 days after fertilization. </p>
<p>4. Treating patients with epigenetic drougs during sensitive periods, for example women during pregnancy, is highly inadvisable because the drougs could interfer with the normal epigenetic reprogramming. The treatment could alter the normal cell programming, leading to a uncorrect embryo development. </p>
