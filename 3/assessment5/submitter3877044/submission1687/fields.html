    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found at the promoter region of the gene esp the tumor suppressor genes &amp;tend to be protected from methylation. Methylation at the CpG islands leads to silencing of gene expression through primarily forming a repressive chromatin structure or prohibiting transcription factor binding.In a normal functioning cell the CGI is hypomethylated hence transcription activation leading to gene expression. However in a cancer cell the CGI is hypermethylated .This contributes to disease by silencing the expression of the tumor suppressor gene thereby leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Normal DNA methylation at the intergenic regions&amp;repetitive is believed to maintain genomic integrity&amp;stability ;prevents transcriptional interference in the gene;prevent transposition of repeats &amp; may prevent illegitimate recombination. In cancer the dna at these regions is hypomethylated leading to ; activation of repeats; cryptic promoters and illegitimate recombinations and mutations that create genomic instability.There is aberrant transcription in disease due to the hypomethylation in the intergenic regions and repeats.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> The paternally expressed lncRNA AIR, which is required for silencing the maternally expressed protein-coding genes Igf2r/Slc22a2/Slc22a3 inhibits their expression by targeting the H3K9 histone methyltransferase G9a to the Slc22a3 promoter.The Igf2 is paternally imprinted. The imprint control region (ICR) is methylated in the paternal allele. This methylation prevents binding of the ICR to the enhancers. In the maternal allele its not methylated thus the ICR binds to the enhancers thereby insulating downstream expression.DNA methylation of the imprint control region spreads to the H19 promoter. This is a CpG island promoter thus methylation leads to silencing of the gene expression. Igf2 is an oncogene; it’s a growth promoter. Thus upregulated expression of Igf2 leads to aberrant growth of cells leading to disease. The Wilm’s tumor is a kidney tumor where there is loss of imprinting of the maternal Cdknc-1. This leads to loss of growth suppression thus there is no tumor suppressor expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.Its a cytosine analogue that hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p>It has been shown to reverse hypermethylation of p15INK4B, allowing for re-establishment of normal p15INK4B protein expression. At high doses,decitabine inhibits cell proliferation through nonreversible covalent linking with DNA methyltransferase and blocking of DNA synthesis.At lower doses,decitabine induces hypomethylation, thereby promoting cell differentiation, re-expressionof tumor suppressor genes, stimulation of immune mechanisms, and suppression of tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p> Sensitive period is a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms; a period of clearing and re-setting of epigenetic marks. These periods in development are susceptible to environmental signals. This sensitive periods are ;</p>
<ol><li>Pre implantation development</li>
<li>Primordial germ cell development.</li>
</ol><p>Treating patients during this periods is inadvisable because there could be disruption of epigenetic reprogramming either due to erosion of DNA methylation imprints ; imprinting disorders; epigenetic anomalies that could be carried on to the next generation mitotically until those aberrant epigenetic marks are actively erased.</p></div>
