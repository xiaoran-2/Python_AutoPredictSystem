    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands normally function as a physiological process with complex biochemical interactions at the molecular level.  For starters allow me to briefly elaborate on CpG,—C—phosphate—G—, meaning<em> Cytosine and Guanine seperated by one phosphate</em>.  Approximately 80% of CpGs are methylated in mammals and, thus, CpG islands are regions in a genome where there are a high frequency of CpG sites.  The normal function of DNA methylation prevents gene expression by altering RNA messenger amount(s).  Enzymes attach chemical tags to DNA bases.  These chemical tags or methyl groups does not mean all DNA bases are methylated.  Methylation occurs mostly in cytosine base sites and guanine bases.  The combined base pairs are known as a CpG, occuring frequently in the promoter region of genes (i.e.  CpG islands).  Methyl groups which tag CpGs decreases a gene's RNA amount; "silencing" a gene, in effect. <br /><img style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-3e705b62c4e1ef192a27bd55/970238/asst-5/970238-52130a722a2289.88744794.gif" alt="" width="498" height="421" /></p>
<p>DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer as there is a change or changes within a gene, and the result is uncontrolled cell growth and multiplication.  The disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease when abnormal methylation of tumor suppressor genes occurs, and it plays a major role in various types of  cancer development as there is a loss of normal function and complications with such cellular abnormality. </p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is radically different from cancer cell methylation.  Gene promoter regions are usually methylation-free, while the genome, itself, is heavily methylated.  In cancer cells, however, the promoter regions are, in  opposite, heavily methylated.  The genome in this particular scenario is abnormally inactive or suppressed.  DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is, furthermore, disrupted in cancer when genes are broken down.  Current  research holds promise, nevertheless.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of the imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/lgf2 cluster, in the following ways:  (1)  H19 is a non-coding RNA with growth suppressive properties, (2)  H19 &amp; lfg2 in cancer cells lose their imprinting, (3) H19's function is to turn off lgf2 expression, and (4)  there's a trade-off in H19's shut-off role which is overexpression of lfg2.  It's this overexpression which contributes to tumorigenesis, and tumor cells have shown maternal chromosome imprinting loss.  There seems to be a transition to paternal methylation as there is inactivated H19 in tumor cells and overexpression in lgf2. </p>
<p><img style="margin-top:37px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0168952501023666-gr4.jpg" alt="" width="668" height="319" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Imprinting at the H19/lgf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm's tumor when H19mRNA expression in the tumor is decreased, suggesting that H19 is inactivated in tumor cells.  Overexpression in lfg2 stimulates cell growth and H19 does the opposite in slowing cell growth.  It's the loss of imprinting which causes uncontrolled cell growth and eventual tumor formation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decibatine may used to treat cancer in low doses.  It falls under a class of drugs known as DNA demythlating agents--chemotherapy category called antimetabolites.  Increases in DNA methylation can often result in suppressor gene blockage.  Suppressor genes regulate cell division and growth and when it's blocked the consequences are unregulated cell division (i.e. cancer promotion). </p>
<p><img src="http://www.southdelhipharma.com/sites/default/files/DACO.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="216" /></p>
<p>Decibatine's impact on DNA methylation works by "de-"methylizing or disrupting DNA methylation.  The demethylation restores tumor suppressor genes.  This restoration is critical in regaining cell growth control.  Decibatine can have an anti-tumor effect for the following reasons:  (1)  it's similar (as antimetabolites are) to a cell's normal substances, (2)  when cells introduce antimetabolites into cellular metabolism there is an interaction within cell structure that produces a cytotoxic effect, and (3)  the cyotoxic effect causes cancer cell death. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Anti-cancer drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects beyond the period of drug treatment by positively enhancing cancer patients reactions to routine chemotherapeutic drugs and post-methylation drug trials.  Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome altering tumors in a more permanent way which significantly contributes to making patients more susceptible to chemotherapy.  A period of development when treating patients on such drugs that should be avoided would likely be the post-sensitive period.  The sensitive period is when environmental signals affect the structure-function of a genome.</p></div>
