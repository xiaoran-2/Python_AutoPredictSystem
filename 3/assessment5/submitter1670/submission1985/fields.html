    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic markers such as DNA methylation play a key role in maintaining normal cell function, and alterations to its pattern can have deleterious consequences for the cells and organisms involved.</p>
<p>CpG islands, many of which are found in gene promoter regions, typically remain unmethylated in wild type cells.  However, in cells predisposed to cancerous growth, CpG islands are often hypermethyalted, leading to the silencing of whatever the gene product lay downstream from that promoter.  This can be particularly damaging if the gene serves as a tumor suppressor- silencing would result in one more hit in the pathways that work in conjunction to protect the cell from unregulated division &amp; growth.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements (some of which are thought to be insertions of viral DNA which over time became stable and amplified within the genome) are typically highly methylated in the healthy somatic cell.  These regions may contain remnants of promoters and other genetic machinery which could trigger the transcription and translation of any number of undesirable downstream products if they are not carefully repressed. In cancer, this pattern of methylation may be lost, resulting in the expression of small RNAs, alternative splicing, among others, which can interfere with the cell's normal replication and division.</p>
<p>Both of these changes to the epigenetic state of a cell can have disastrous consequences downstream, despite lack of mutation in the genetic code. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allelle, the imprint control region is methylated, and the methylation extends dowstream to the promoter region of the H19 gene.  This allows the enhancers which sit downstream from both the ICR &amp; H19 region to act at a longer distance on the Igf2 gene.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing an insulating protein called CTCF to block the Igf2 region from the downstream enhancers, creating a feedback loop between the now expressed H19 gene and the local enhancers and resulting the down regulation of Igf2.</p>
<p>A loss of imprinting at the maternal allele (or complete replacement with a paternal allele) results in the maternal genetic profile mimicing that of the paternal allele, leading to an unwarranted upregulation of the tumor-promoting gene Igf2.  This growth factor triggers a number of pathologic respones, including a predisposition to childhood tumors, such as the Wilm's tumor found in the kidney of some children with this genetic syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cytosine analog, which means it mimcs the target of DNA methyltransferase I and irreversibly binds to it, leading to its depletion.  This leads to an overall hypomethylation of DNA within the cell.  It, and other drugs in this class, have been shown to lead to a reactivation of tumor suppressor genes which had previously been hypermethylated in their disease state.  This allows a cancer cell to revert back towards a healthy genetic profile, tamping down its oncogenic potential.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A certain amount of DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, through mechanisms that have not yet been completely elucidated.  However, it has been shown that changes in the methylation pattern can be maintained in an individual and also passed through several generations.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those during which DNA methylation markers are removed and reestablished and can be altered by the enviornment and other processes. This occurs in particular during two times in development.  After fertilization, epigenetic markers are stripped from the maternal and paternal alleles and reestablished at the blastocyst stage.  Most somatic cells then maintain their epigenetic markers throughout their life, but the primordial germ cells undergo a further stripping of epigenetic inheritance to be reestablished in the epigenetic profile necessary to go on to create viable offspring later in life.  Some evidence also contends that particularly in males, just before puberty is also a sensitive period, during which time the epigenetic patterns for sperm are maturing.  </p>
<p>Treating patients who hope to have future fertility at these times would be risky, as it could lead to incorrect and deleterious patterning in both egg and sperm cells, negatively affecting future offspring.</p></div>
