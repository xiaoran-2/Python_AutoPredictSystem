    <div class="field-value"><p>   The three most important DNA regions, that are subjected to DNA methylation are the CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>   CpG islands are usually found at the gene promoters, the sites that initiate replication. When this region is methylated, the enzymes, required for DNA-replication, cannot bind to DNA and thus are not able to perform the replication and silencing of gene expression occurs. In most cases CpG islands remain unmethylated in healthy cells. In case of cancer, they tend to be hypermethylated. This leads to silencing of the expression of genes, that code for specific tumour suppressors, resulting in uncontrollable tumour development.  </p>
<p>    Intergenic regions, on the other hand, are DNA-sequences between important genes, that may also contain a promoter. In order to make sure that this promoter is not bound by a polymerase and expressed in the same time when the important genes are, these regions are methylated in healthy cells. In case of cancer, however, they are being hypomethylated, which causes genomic instability and thus results in altered gene expression.</p>
<p>     Finally, repetitive elements are multiple copies of one and the same gene, that tend to insert themselves throughout the genome. In order to avoid them causing genomic instability on chromosomes, they are silenced by methylation in healthy cells. In cancer cells, on the other hand, they are hypomethylated, causing chromosomes disintegrations like deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. This leads to mutagenic transposition and complete genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>    H19 and Igf2 form a cluster on one chromosome. When comparing the maternal and paternal copy’s imprinting control regions (ICR) it becomes clear that they are differently methylated. On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated. This helps it recruit the CTCF factor. This CTCF factor restricts the job of the enhancers and they are not able to bind the Igf2 gene, remaining silent. They bind the gene H19 instead and express it. On the paternal allele, the ICR and H19 gene are both methylated. This means that H19 is not expressed due to the methylation. The CTCF factor, is not able to bind ICR and the enhancers succeed to bind the Igf2 gene and express it. Thus Igf2 is expressed by the paternal allele and H19 by the maternal one only.</p>
<p>   In Wilm’s tumour hypermethylation in the H19/Igf2 cluster occurs. The imprinted control region and gene H19 are methylated on both alleles. Consequently, both alleles express Igf2, but none of them H19. Due to the loss of imprinting a double dose of Igf2 is produced. Igf2 is growth promoting and is prone to cause an uncontrolled growth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>    Decitabine is a DNA-Methyltrasferase inhibitor. It comprises nucleoside analogues, which incorporate into normal DNA. When one methylated strand is replicated, its daughter strand remains unmethylated. DNMT lays down the same amount of methylation on the daughter strand as the one in the original strand. When Decitabine’s nucleoside analogues replicate alongside the normal DNA, the DNMT binds and methylate the daughter strand as it usually does. However, the nucleoside analogues don’t allow it to be released. This reduces methylation and thus can be described as causing hypomethylation. Tumour is caused by uncontrollably dividing cells. Having in mind that Decitabine has an effect on every division, we can assume that the more the DNA replicates, the more affected is it, and therefore causes certain restriction on cell division and tumour development. Probably it would act on CpG islands, which tend to be hypermethylated in cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>   Epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, meaning that each daughter cell receives the epigenetic make-up in every division. So that altered DNA-methylation will be passed on to the rest of the genome and remain the same over the time and react with chemotherapeutics, applied later on.</p>
<p> There are periods in which epigenetic reprogramming occurs. In other words, epigenetic marks are deleted and reset again later on in tissue specific manner. Those periods in which epigenetic modifications are present are denoted “sensitive periods”. The first sensitive period is marked by complete DNA-demethylation throughout the genome in pre-implantation period (Early development). The second one is during primordial germ cell development, when somatic marks of the germ cells are removed and germ epigenetic marks are layed down.</p>
<p> During those periods, the epigenetic marks are in modification, meaning that they are not completely set up and don’t need to be disturbed. Therefore, if drug inhibiting demethylation is applied during the Early development when active demethylation must occur , then the drug is going to disturb the epigenetic reprogramming and it would cause serious consequences.</p></div>
