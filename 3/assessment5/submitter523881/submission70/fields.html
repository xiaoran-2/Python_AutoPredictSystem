    <div class="field-value">Methylation is the enzymatic addition of a methyl-group, in the case of cytosine at the C5-position to form 5.methylcytosine by a DNA methyl-transferase . In a normal mammalian cells this modification is found throughout the genome especially at CpG islands: sequences of guanosine followed by cytosine.   This is an epigenetic modification: It is inheritable, but reversible. Methylation of CpG islands is involved in various processes leading to a more condensed state of the DNA (heterochromatin) , for example in X-chromosome inactivation.  This mechanism is also used to silence repetitive sequences. An exception are CpG islands in promoter regions, which normally do not contain methylated cytosine.  

Studying the methylation pattern of cancer cells revealed interesting changes in the overall methylation: Whereas the methylation of GpG islands in general decreases, GpG island of promoter regions become hypermethylated. This could reflect advantages the tumor cell could derive from the new properties involved: the loss of silencing of repetitive elements could lead to a more instable genome, strong promoters could become placed close to the oncogenes and activate them.  Methylation in promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes on the other side could silence those and loosen the control of proliferation of the cancer cell, apotosis or affect repair of DNA damage.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-Methyltransferase-Inhibitor.  Decitabine is a cytidine analog. Once incorporated into the DNA in the place of a normal cytosine base, it can bind and thereby inactivate DNA-Methyltransferase. Incorporation of this molecule into the DNA involves replication, so only proliferating cells are targeted by this drug.
This type of drug is targeted at cancers where a changed pattern of methylation is suspected to could have contributed to the cancerous state of the cell, for instance by the activation of tumor suppressor genes by a hypermethylation of its GpC islands. Decitabine is FDA approved and used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome.
So adding Dectabine to the treatment of cancer in combination with more traditional anticancer drugs could add to synergistic effects, attacking the viability the of the cancer cell on different levels.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methyliation is an epigenetic mark: It is inheritable, the pattern of the newly synthesized DNA strand is copied DNA-Methyltransferases. But in contrast to mutations in the DNA sequence, epigenetic marks are reversible and can be removed. Once a new pattern is established (for example by the use of DNA-Methyl-Transferase-Inhibitors or DNA-demethylating agents, the epigenetic methylation code will then be copied during replications after the treatment is finished.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are times points during development that are especially sensitive to environmental factors. In the case of epigenetic control these involve the periods of epigenetic reprogramming: the blastocyste preimplatation embryo and gametogenesis. So phases of clearing and resetting epigenetic marks would be very vulnerable to drugs changing the methylating processes.</p>
<p>This treatment would not be recommended for expecting mothers. But also in somatic cells throughout normal life epigenetic marks have to be reestablished in dividing cells, for example hematopoietic cells and stem cells for different tissues. Treatment with drugs involved in demethylation could lead to activation of repetitive sequences and transposons and transformation of these cells. So these drugs would probably best used in elderly patients, where the short term benefits outweigh the long term effects. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>IGF2 is expressed paternally while H19 is expressed maternally in normal cells. The silencing of these genes is achieved by DNA methylation in the promoter region.  In Wilms tumor this imprinting pattern can be disturbed: IGF2 genes become expressed biallelically (also on the maternal chromosome). Changes affect the entire H19/IGF2 cluster: increased methylation of the maternal H19 allele is found in Wilms tumor cells and could lead to silencing of the H19 gene (while the maternal IGF2 is activated).  </p>
<p> This could mimic the mechanism of silencing of the IGF2 allele on the paternal chromosome, where hypermethylation of the H19 promoter leads to the expression of the paternal allele of IGF2.</p>
<p> IGF2 is an embryonic growth factor. The activation of transcription of this factor could help the tumor cells to circumvent growth restrictions. H19 could act as a tumor suppressor gene and its loss could also lead to tumor genesis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(My answer is based on : “Epigenetic changes encompassing the IGF2/H19 locus associated with relaxation of IGF2 imprinting and silencing of Hi9 in Wilms tumor”,TAKANOBU TANIGUCHI et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 92, pp. 2159-2163, March 1995)</p></div>
