    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the mechanism behind genetic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and formation of heterochromatin. DNA methylation of promoter regions silences gene expression. An exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% and are generally free of methylation. Silencing of repetitive sequences and formation of silent heterochromatin but also DNA access for transcription in euchromatin or DNA replication are dependent on  DNA methylation. </p>
<p>In cancer cells those CpG islands become hypermethylated (called CIMP that stands for CpG island methylator phenotype) what silences tumour suppressor genes and results in loss of genetic imprinting in the ICR (Imprinting Control Region). Further a genome wide DNA hypomethylation is observed that also causes weakening of genetic integrity of repetitive regions, CpG poor promoters and loss of imprinting in the ICRs. All together may contribute to uncontrolled tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the ICR is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. In the maternal allele the CTCF bind is an insulator element and enhancers will act upon the H19. Therefore the Igf2 is silenced.<br />In the paternal allele because the ICR is methylated the enhancers can act on the Igf2 and therefore activate the expression of Igf2. </p>
<p>With loss of imprinting the ICR is also methylated on the maternal allele that results also in enhancer activating the expression of Igf2. So since now Igf2 is expressed in the maternal and paternal allele it will cause overexpression of Idf2. Igf2 is growth promoting and its overexpression contributes to Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent in the form of Azacitidine. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, a condition where certain blood cells are dysfunctional and which is a precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia.<br />Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. This causes cell death of abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slows tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer (a solid tumour). The cells of the solid tumour are changed in a lasting way that it becomes more suspectible to standard chemotherapy.<span> Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division. If those changes are erased and not further passed then abnormal epigenetic alterations can be reversed without killing all cells (as done before with standard chemotherapy). This would lead to new kind of treatment.</span></span></p>
<p>Epigentic drugs may have unwelcome side effects during the sensitive period i.e. the period from gametes to the development of the blastocyst. Here e.g. a DNA-demethylations may cause unwanted epigentic changes in an embryo.</p></div>
