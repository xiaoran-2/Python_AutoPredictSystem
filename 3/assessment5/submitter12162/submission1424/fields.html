    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters, have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation.</li>
<li>In cancer, gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division.</li>
<li>Role of DNA methylation is context dependent. Contributions of DNA methylation to cancer are:  Tumour suppressor hypermethylation and Hypomethylation genome-wide. In CpG islands case, the tumour is driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation, then depletion of DNA methylation appears to suppress tumorigenesis.</li>
<li>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated.</li>
<li><span><span>In cancer, <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to become hypomethylated, which might lead to genomic instablility.</span></span></span></li>
<li>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements case, tumour is driven by chromosomal instability, then depletion of DNA methylation appears to enhance tumorigenesis.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent, it belongs to the class of DNMT (Mammalian DNA methyltransferase) inhibitors</li>
<li>Decitabine is a cytidine antimetabolite analogue with potential antineoplastic activity. Decitabine incorporates into DNA and inhibits DNA methyltransferase, resulting in hypomethylation of DNA and intra-S-phase arrest of DNA replication.</li>
<li>Mechanism: inhibition of DNA methyltransferase at low doses, causing hypomethylation of DNA, and direct cytotoxicity in abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA at high doses, resulting in cell death.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><span>Epigenetic changes such as <span>altering DNA methylation </span>are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells, which have enduring effects on the epigenome, until they are actively erased. </span></li>
<li>
<p>This is the period of development when environment has the biggest influence on the epigenetic makeup of the animal. The sensitive periods are the periods when the epigenome is actively remodeled (i.e., removal and reestablishment of epigenetic marks) and include:</p>
<ol><li>Primordial germ cell development through mature eggs/sperm</li>
<li>Preimplantation and postimplantation periods.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Treating a pregnant mother with epigenetic drugs could affect future generations. For example, <span>methyl groups have been linked to an increased risk of asthma and brain and spinal cord defects in children, if an epigenetics durg reduces the amount of methyl groups in a mother during her pregnancy, it will have effect on her child.</span></li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The imprint control region (ICR) of <span><span>H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele. T</span></span>he enhancers can act on IGF2, because CTCF is not binding to intulate the ICR, and IGF2 is expressed from the pattern allele.</li>
<li><span><span>ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele. </span></span>When it's unmethylated, CTCF binds its insulator element, and it means that the enhancers in this case will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so there is no expression.</li>
<li>With loss of imprinting and what happened is the acquiring of hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele as well. Then, on the maternal allele, There is also expression of Igf2. So now there is a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to what is seen in a normal cell. And Igf2 is both growth promoting, and this is associated with Wilm's tumour.</li>
<li>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes.</li>
