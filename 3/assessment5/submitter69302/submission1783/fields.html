    <div class="field-value"><p>Most DNA methylation occurs at CpG dinucleotides and most CpGs are methylated, but about half of all mammalian genes have clusters of CpGs, called CpG islands, associated with their promoters and these CpG islands are usually unmethylated. The methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is associated with transcriptional silencing, whereas the lack of methylation at CpG islands means that the associated genes can potentially be transcribed. In cancer, the situation is often reversed and CpG islands become methylated and CpGs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements become unmethylated. The hypermethylation of CpG islands leads to a general silencing of gene expression including, importantly for the development of cancer, the inactivation of tumour suppressor genes (for example, the hypermethylation of the BRCA1 gene in breast cancer or of the RB gene in retinoblastoma). The hypomethylation of other CpGs also serves to promote cancer by causing genomic instability. The lack of methylation can lead to activation of transposons and recombination between repeats, both of which can lead to large scale chromosomal changes like deletions, insertions and translocations. These genetic changes can, in turn, promote cancer development. At a smaller scale, hypomethylation can cause expression from previously silent cryptic promoters, leading to changes from normal gene expression and consequently, in some cases, cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The disruption of imprinting by the hypermethylation or hypomethylation of imprinting control regions (ICRs) can lead to the development of cancer. One example is that of the H19/Igf2 cluster. Usually the ICR of the paternal allele of this cluster is methylated and this methylation spreads to the downstream H19 promoter, which is therefore silenced. In this situation, enhancers further downstream of the ICR activate expression of the upstream Igf2 gene, which encodes a growth factor. However, the ICR of the maternal allele is not methylated and neither is the H19 promoter. In this situation, the transcription factor CTCF can bind to the ICR and insulate Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. Also methylation won't spread to the H19 promoter. Therefore Igf2 will be silenced, but the H19 promoter will be activated.</p>
<p>Locus-specific hypermethylation is one of the common features of cancer and in this case leads to the methylation of the ICR in not only the paternal allele but also the maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster. This means that CTCF cannot bind and both Igf2 alleles can be transcribed, leading to the overexpression of this growth factor and therefore to Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug from the class of DNA methytransferase (DNMT) inhibitors. It is an analogue of the base cytosine and is incorporated into DNA during replication. Once part of DNA, Decitabine irreversibly binds to DNMTs, thus inhibiting their usual function of methylating DNA and leading to generalised hypomethylation, including of the CpG islands associated with gene promoters. This can lead to activation of tumour suppressor genes which are otherwise often silenced during the development of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There is some evidence that the use of drugs that alter DNA methylation can have an enduring effect beyond their treatment period. This is not surprising, since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. However, there are likely to be periods when treating patients with such drugs is inadvisable. These are the so called sensitive periods during pre-implantation embryonic development and during primordial germ cell development. Disruption of the epigenetic machinery (for example, by treatment with drugs that alter DNA methylation) is likely to have major consequences on early development and germ cell development. For example, mice models have shown that DNA methyltransferase is essential for early development and for proper germ cell imprinting. Therefore a similar effect would be expected in human patients.</p></div>
