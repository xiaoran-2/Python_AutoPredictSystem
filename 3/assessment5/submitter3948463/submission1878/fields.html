    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands results in the silencing of gene expression and is therefore an inactive epigenetic mark. In normal cells, most CpG islands aren’t methylated. In cancer cells, however, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than in normal cells. These methylated CpG islands tend to be located at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, thereby inactivating their expression and allowing cancer to occur.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is necessary to maintain genomic stability, through their silencing and mutation (meC to T) to prevent transposition to other parts of the genome and to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters.  In normal cells, the DNA is usually methylated at both intergenic regions and repetitive elements. By contrast, in cancer cells there’s hypomethylation at these regions of the genome. Consequently, there’s illegitimate recombination between repeats, resulting in translocations between different chromosomes; activation of repeats resulting in the ability of repeats to make a copy of themselves and transpose it in another part of the genome, and transcriptional aberration in the surrounding regions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In non-cancerous cells, the ICR at the maternal allele is unmethylated. In this case, the insulator element CTCF will bind to the ICR and the downstream enhancers will act on H19 and the expression of IGF-2 is silenced. By contrast, the ICR at the paternal allele is methylated and the enhancers can then act on IGF-2 and allow its expression.</p>
<p>In cancerous cells there’s loss of imprinting. In the case of the H19/IGF2 cluster, cancerous cells exhibit hypermethylation of the ICR at the maternal allele and expression of IGF-2. Therefore, the expression of IGF-2 is doubled in comparison to normal cells. Since IGF-2 is a growth-promoting gene, its overexpression increases the likelihood of getting cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). It’s a nucleoside that is incorporated into the DNA after replication and that binds irreversibly to DNMTs, resulting in DNA hypomethylation. Since cancer cells divide much more rapidly than most normal cells, then at low doses it has an anti-neoplastic effect through the reactivation of the expression of tumor suppressor genes and apoptosis-related genes silenced by methylation, therefore favoring the induction of apoptosis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, meaning it’s passed on through cell division to daughter cells. By altering the DNA methylation make-up of the cell, you’re also ensuring the maintenance of that DNA methylation profile onto its daughter cells and so forth.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are time intervals at which the epigenetic marks are being laid down and established, rather than being maintained. These sensitive periods are usually the pre-implantation and early implantation phase of the embryo and the development of primordial germ cells all the way through the production of mature gametes.</p>
<p>Therefore, treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the DNA methylation profile you’d be altering by drug treatment would possibly be transmitted to germ cells, which would then affect the next generation.</p></div>
