    <div class="field-value"><p>How DNA methylation is altered in tumor cells is context dependent, meaning that both hyper- and hypo-methylation can occur in a tumor cell.  Some tumor cells are driven by DNA hypomethylation of CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, while others are driven by genomic instability caused by hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions.  Also the level of hypo- or hyper-methylation can change during the lifetime of the cancer, for example a cancer may be driven by DNA hypermethylation in its early stages while in the later stages the cancer may be driven by hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  In a normal cell, CpG islands are generally unmethylated while the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated.  In cancer cells, in general, the opposite is true such that the CpG islands become hyper-methylated while the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypo-methylated.  DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands located in promoters will usually silence a gene, and it is often seen that the CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes are silenced in cancer cells, thus preventing the cell from protecting itself against the development of cancer. DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive regions often leads to overall genomic instability.  This genomic instability can occur due to hypomethylation of repetitive DNA which causes DNA that is normally heterochromatinized and inactive to become activated.  This can lead to activation of transposons which can move around the genome and disrupt other genes, illegitimate recombination between chromosomes, and large deletions and insertions of chromosome pieces in inappropriate places in the genome.  Genomic instability can also occur from the activation of intergenic regions which could activate cryptic promoters which can lead to the disruption of neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated, not allowing CTCF to bind to the imprint control region (ICR) , which in turn causes the enhancers in the region to act on Igf2 rather than H19, this means Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.  In a normal cell, the ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind which causes the enhancers in the region to act on H19 only, this means that Igf2 is silenced from the maternal allele.  In a Wilm's tumor, imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster in that there is methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele, thus allowing expression of Igf2 from both alleles. Igf2 is growth promoting, and it is this increased cellular growth that leads to diseases such a Wilm's tumor in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  Decitabine gets incorporated into the DNA and when a DNA methyltransferase binds to the decitabine it is irreversibly bound to the DNA and the methylation cannot be copied to the daughter strand, thus effectively demethylating methylated DNA in dividing cells.  Since many tumors are known to have abnormal hypermethylation of CpG islands associated with tumor suppressor genes, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors such as decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect by decreasing methylation in cells during mitosis, especially cells with a high rate of cell division.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome since DNA methylation is a relatively stable epigenetic mark and is mitotically heritable, meaning that if a cell has a particular methylation pattern, the daughter cells will display the same methylation pattern. A sensitive period is a time during a person's lifetime that epigenetic reprogramming occurs.  The known sensitive periods in human development involving methylation include during embryonic development, early childhood and during gamete development.  Treating patients during these sensitive periods could alter the methylation patterns of the cells undergoing reprogramming, which could inadvertently lead to cancers or other diseases related to abnormal epigenetic marks on the DNA.</p></div>
