    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands functions to cause gene silencing.</p>
<p>The amount of DNA methylation at CpG islands in a particular promoter is inappropriately increased (hypermethylation) in cancer. Such DNA hypermethylation is caused by the activity of the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1).</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of the CpG island silences the tumor suppressor gene. Tumor suppressor gene is able to suppress abnormal proliferation of cells. When it is silenced through hypermethylation of the related CpG island, cancer is resulted.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements function to maintain the stability of the genome.</p>
<p>The amount of DNA methylation in the intergenic region and repetitive elements is greatly reduced (hypomethylation) in cancer. Such DNA hypomethylation might be caused by the reduced activity of DNMT1 (active) or dilution through cell division (passive).</p>
<p>In cancer, hypomethylation occurs in the intergenic region and repetitive elements. This results in genomic instability where inappropriate gene expression or illegitimate recombination of chromosomal segments or generation of long non-coding RNAs that could interfere with normal gene expression could happen. Therefore, contribute to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at the imprint control region (ICR) of the paternal allele prevents the binding of CTCF to the ICR. Without CTCF,  DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter and silences H19. Also, the absence of CTCF binding to the ICR allows the enhancer to access to Igf2 and causes Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>ICR of the maternal allele is not methylated. This allows the binding of CTCF to the ICR which prevents the spreading of methylation to the promoter of H19. Promoter of H19 is not methylated and H19 is expressed. CTCF binding to the ICR on maternal allele isolates the enhancer from Igf2, which silences the Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, mutation causes the loss of imprinting, resulting in the maternal allele behaves like paternal allele. As mentioned, there's a paternal expression of Igf2 under normal condition. When the imprinting is lost, both alleles express Igf2, causing overexpression of the growth-promoting Igf2. Simultaneously, Cdkn1c, a tumour suppressor, is lost and tumour is resulted.</p>
<p>When the imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted, the methylation pattern of the alleles is affected which subsequently affect the expression of Igf2. Igf2 is an oncogene. Its overexpression can cause tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent.</p>
<p>Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase, decreasing DNA methylation.</p>
<p>As Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase, DNA methylation decreases. This can either upregulate the expression of tumour suppressor factors or the downregulation of the growth-promoting factors or both, leading to anti-tumour effect.</p>
<p> </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration in DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. The effect brought on by such alteration in DNA methylation is passed on to the subsequent daughter cells and thus having enduring effect on the epigenome.</p>
<p>The sensitive period is the period in which epigenetic reprogramming occurs.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods of developement are the period of germ cell development and pre-implantation period of early embryo development.</p>
<p>During the sensitive periods, the imprinted genes (pre-implantation period of early embryo development) and the repetitive elements (throughout the sensitive periods) are continue to be methylated when the rest of the epigenome are cleared of epigenetic marks. If epigenetic drugs are used during such periods, the removal of DNA methylations on the imprinted genes or repetitive elements would alter the expression of certain gene products or undesirable mutations which could subsequently worsen the outcome. So, it isinadvisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during such sensitive periods.</p>
