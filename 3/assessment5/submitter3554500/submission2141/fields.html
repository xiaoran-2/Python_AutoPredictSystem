    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1">In a normal functioning cell, there is usually very little DNA methylation of CpG islands. This means that the promoters of a gene are able to be accessed and the genes themselves are able to be expressed.   Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are usually composed of larger amounts of methylation (hypermethylation).  This means that these parts of the genome are more closely associated with histones and condensed into chromatin.  This results in greater difficulty in accessing these areas of the genome. </p>
<p class="p1">There are two types of changes that can occur associated with the DNA methylation of genes in cancer cells.  There is generally hypomethylation across the entire genome in a cancer cell, however there are also specific areas that undergo hypermethylation.   </p>
<p class="p1">In cancer, the disruption of DNA methylation of CpG islands is usually located in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes.  This is seen as hypermethylation of these regions.  When the CpGs of these tumour suppressor genes become hypermethylated, the genes become less accessible to transcription apparatus and in turn are silenced.  Silencing of tumour suppressor cells allows for increased proliferation of these cancerous cells.   The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are more likely to undergo hypomethylation in tumour cells.  Once these areas of the genome are hypomethylated, they are more accessible, allowing for increased genetic and epigenetic changes to the genome, enabling tumour proliferation and contributing to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1">In genomic imprinting there is monoallelic expression of a gene, always from the same parent.</p>
<p class="p1">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is hypermethylated in the ICR region, with DNA methylation spreading downstream from the ICR to the H19 gene.  There is no methylation on the maternal allele.  The insulator protein CTCF is only able to bind to an unmethylated ICR.  The unmethylated maternal ICR is thus bound by CTCF, insulating the maternal Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers, therefore no maternal expression of Igf2.  The paternal ICR cannot be bound by CTCF as it is methylated, allowing the downstream enhancers to bind the paternal Igf2 gene resulting in expression.  The Igf2 gene is only paternally expressed.</p>
<p class="p1">We see individuals with a loss of imprinting in the H19/Igf2 cluster, and the closely linked Knq1 cluster.  In these patients the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele.  Other individuals can have  two copies of the paternal allele, known as paternal uniparental disomy.  These changes result in up regulation of Igf2 (growth promotant gene) and loss of Cdkn1c expression (growth regulator gene, Kcnq1 cluster).  The individual sufferers have fetal and post-natal overgrowth, including childhood tumours such as Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1">There are now a few drugs that are being used to treat cancer by exerting an effect on the epigenome, Decitabine is one of these.  Decitabine belongs to a class of agents that cause DNA-demethylation, therefore they act by removing methyl groups from the DNA.  As previously mentioned, in many cancers there is hypermethylation of the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes.  This hypermethylation silences these genes.  By using drugs that work by demethylating the DNA, they are able to ‘un-silence’ the genes and recover their function.  It is because of the ‘un-silencing’ of the tumour suppressor genes that these types of drugs are able to exert an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1">DNA methylation is mitotically inherited.  Thus the level of methylation in a cell is passed onto the daughter cell, then onto the granddaughter cell and so-on.  When the level of DNA methylation of the genome is altered, say by de-methylating drugs, this alteration is passed onto subsequent cells.  This has the potential to be both good and bad.   In the case of some cancer treatments it is good, but there are times in the life of an individual where de-methylation of the epigenome would be detrimental, this includes periods of epigenetic reprogramming referred to as sensitive periods.  These periods include early development (between fertilisation and blastocyst stage) and at the time of primordial germ cell development.  It could be argued that another sensitive period is also early childhood due to rapid growth. </p>
<p class="p1">During these periods the epigenome is greatly susceptible to the effects of drugs, particularly those that alter the level of DNA methylation.  If patients were to be treated with these drugs during these sensitive periods, there is the increased chance that the normal epigenetic marks required for normal development may be altered to the detriment of the patient.</p></div>
