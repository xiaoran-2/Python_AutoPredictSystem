    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are most usually find in the promoters region, most of the time they are unmethylated allowing gene expression. In cancer we have CpG islands hypermethylation, causing a condensation of chromatine in the promoters region and by that inhibiting transcription of that particular gene. Repetitive elements and intergenic region are usually silence to maintain gene integrity. So these regions need to be methylated in order to prevent deletions, translocations and insertions, also to silence cryptic transcription, avoid transcriptional interference form the repeats promoters, prevent transposition and illegitimate recombination. What happens in cancer is that these regions are unmethylated, allowing all this mutations to happen and causing gene instability. This changes in the methylation happens in different tumour supressors genes for each type of tumour, disrupting the transcription of this genes and make it easier for a tumour to grow and could be considered one of the hits for a cancer to occur occording to Knudson hyphotesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mytotic heritable, so the cells that were treated with the drugs will pass on the changes in DNA methylation to their daughter strand, by that the effects on changes of epigenetic can last beyond the drug treatment and perhaps through the intire indivudual life. A sensitive period is the time of life were there's an epigenetic reset, so all the epigenetic marks are clear for some time in the tissue and will be reseted. The most important sensitive periods in devolopment is during pre implatantion  and primordial germ cell development, altought there is other sensitive times that are specific to some tissues. Treating patients in that periods is dangerous because the interferance can cause mutations in epigenetic reprograming, it can cause some gene that needs to be active to silence and that genes that supose to be silent became active. That can lead to a lot of different conditions and it's very umpredictable what could happen.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are two types of abnormalities that cancer can do to the imprinted genes, there's either hypomethylation or hypermethylation at both of the alleles depending on the type of cancer. In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster there's a hypermethylation in the ICR of both alleles. Normally, in the maternal allele, the ICR (imprint control region) is unmethylated, and it's bound by an insulator protein that insulates downstream enhancers from acting on the Igf2 letting them free to act on H19, wich is expressed from the maternal allele. In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, therefore inhibiting the bound of the insulator protein and allowing the enhacers to act on Igf2 enabling it's expression from the paternal allele. In cancer both maternal and paternal ICR are methylated. Wich causes both alleles to behave like the paternal allele, leading to doble expression of Igf2 and none expression of H19. The Igf2 contributes to cancer because it is a growth promoter.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, that means that it acts in the part of DNA where the metyltranfereses shoud bind, desabling it's function and causing a dependence on replication. Decitabine have an anti-tumour effect by preventing the tumor for silencing tumour supressor genes in more cells and by preventing it's from growing and replicating.  </p></div>
