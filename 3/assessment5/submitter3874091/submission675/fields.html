    <h1>Submission 675 from Anon (session_user_id: 05f8d11c5732b44b0a0c82db4d1d91ec98e6fb76)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The enzyme attaches methyl groups to histone proteins,which are part of the chromosomal packaging.The overactivity methylates histones silences the genes they surround, including so called tumour-suppressor genes that stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. Myc-driven myeloma suffered were treated with JQ1 that worked by shut down of Myc-activated genes and slowed the proliferation of myeloma cells. Decitabine are used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>the combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitator and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advacned lung cancer. drugs had been deployed sucessfully against a solid tumour rather than leukaemia. routine chemotherpeutic drugs shows good reaction.</p>
<p>sensitive period refers to pre-implantation development and germ cell development. epegentics changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.Once erased,though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>cancer cells display loss of imprinting. in other words, genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent of origin specific expression are imprinted no longer show this imprint of expression but rather they become either expressed from parental alleles or silent from parental alleles. In H19/Igf2 cluster the imprint shows as the oval .and it's methylated on the paternal allele, and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele.when it's unmethylated CTCF 4 bind is insulator element, and it means that the enhancers in this case will act on H19. but Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so we don't see expression. On the paternal allele, because this is methylated,now the enhancers can act on Igf2,because CTCF is not binding to intulate this, and Igf2 is expressed from the parental allele.then on maternal allele also have expression of Igf2.we have double dose of Igf2 in comprasion to noraml cell. and Igf2 is both growing promoting and this is associated with Wilm's tumour. This is particular childhood kidney genome that is observed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG island hypermethylation,an associated gene silencing, occurs really frequently in tumours.DNA methylation is maternically inheritable, so it is very effective way of silencing a tumour supressive gene.The DNA hypermethylation is reversible.so DNA methylation occuring frequently in cancer and has caught some consequences for the cell,but it is reversible.DNA methylation profiles are unique to each of the particular genosubtypes. Retinoblastoma a type of cancer of the eye is frequently found to be hereditary cancer.DNA methylation of the MLH1 markers in colorectal cancer, in Lynch syndrome. Also in breast cancer BRCA1 and BRCA2 are responsible for a fairly large proportion of the hereditary, breast cancer, and they seem to be mutated in sporadic cases as well. BRCA 1 can be hypermethylated rather than mutated.MGMT can be hypermethylated is found to be hypermethylated in glioma, it's a type of brain cancer, but also in colorectal tumours.we know that some tumours cells passage through blood and if we could detect those tumour cells, we can predict whether or not somebody is either cancer. The island of CpG spread throughout the genome and are hypomethylated so what's unusual is to find hypermethylated.</p></div>
