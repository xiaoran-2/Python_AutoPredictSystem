    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation (methylation at C-5 of cytosine bases) plays an important role in normal cell function by regulating transcription. For example, methylated CpG islands, which are often associated with the promoter regins of genes, can silence gene transcription. This occurs by Methyl-CPG-Binding Proteins (MeCPs) recognizing and binding methylated CpG islands at the gene promoter regions, which can cause the associated chromatin to condense and shield the neighboring genes from transcription. This mechanism allows unrequired growth promoting genes or oncogenes to be silenced so that cell growth can be regulated to normal levels. However, in cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands can lead to unwanted silencing of other genes such as tumour suppressor genes, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and ultimately cancer. However both hypo- and hypermethylation of CpG islands can lead to cancer depending on the type of gene in affected. For example, hypomethylation of CpG at the promotors of oncogenes can also lead to cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions helps maintain genomic integrity by, for example, silencing cryptic promoters, which can otherwise disrupt the expression of normal and nearby genes. DNA methylation at repetitive elements helps to silence the transcription of IAPs, which tend to be mutanogenic when expressed, because of their propensity to translocate and proliferate. In cancer, hypomethylation at repetitive elements and at intergenic regions leads to genomic instability because insertions and transpositions of unwanted genes, which would have otherwise been silenced by normal levels of methylation can now occur and can lead to abnormal cell growth and tumourigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted genes is methylated on the paternal allele. This methylation is also spread to the CpG promoter region of the H19 gene. The nearby enhancers in this imprint control region (ICR) act on the Igf2 gene and promote its expression, as this arrangement constitutes the preferred conformation of the chromatin looping. In contrast, on the maternal allele, the lack of methylation at the imprinted region allows CTCF to bind to it. The presence of CTCF in this region prevents the preferred conformation of the chromatin looping from taking place and the nearby enhancer regions are prevented from accessing Igf2 and  the enhancer regions promote the expression of the H19 gene instead.</p>
<p>In Beckwith Weiderman syndrome both alleles act as the paternal allele, either because the sufferer inherits two copies of the paternal allele for a range of reasons. The result is no methylation on either allele of the ICR in this cluster and CTCF cannot bind to either the maternal or paternal allele resulting in a ’double dose’ or overexpression of Igf2 – a growth promoting gene – and therefore uncontrolled cell growth. This results in fetal and post-natal overgrowth, macroglossia and a predisposition to embryonic and childhood tumours which, if in the kidney, are known as <strong>Wilm’s tumour</strong>.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cytidine nucleoside mimetic DNA Methyl Transferease inhibitor (DNMTi). This class of drugs become incorporated into the DNA and bind irreversibly to DNA Methyl Transferases (DNMTs). Therefore, the ability of DNMTs to bind to methylated DNA and subsequently copy the methylation pattern to the adjacent daughter strand (although other unknown off-target effects may also be in operation) is inhibited by decitabine. This mechanism of inhibition then relies on DNA replication. The efficacy of Decitabine towards Myelodysplastic Syndrome and ultimately Acute Myeloid Leukemia cells over normal tissue is probably because the cancerous cells are highly reliant on hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes for proliferation. Thus, at the right dosage, only rapidly dividing cells that rely on hypermethylation of tumour supressors will be affected. Indeed, it is well known that heavy CpG hypermethylation has a poor prognostic marker for Myelodysplatic Syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Mitotic heretablity of epigenetic information ensure that the identity of cells can be maintained thoughout the development of tissues and produce tissue homogeneity. The pattern of DNA methylation encoded into the epigenome can be identified and copied to the newly formed DNA strands. In this way the gene expression profile of the daughter cells will be the same as the cell of origin and this process persist in the somatic cells. Of course, at some point the epigenetic identity of each cell must be set. These so-called sensitive periods of development occur when this epigenetic reprogramming takes place. This is most well studied for the removal and reestablishment of DNA methylation, which occurs during primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development. During these periods the levels of DNA methylation that takes place can be highly dependant on the environment.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that drugs which may operate by interfering with epigenetic mechanism may have many undesired or uncontrollable consequences during periods of epigenetic reprogramming. In particular it would be strongly advised not to treat pregnant patients with drugs that have an epigenetic modifying mode of action. </p></div>
