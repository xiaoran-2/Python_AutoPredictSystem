    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation and cancer</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation is widespread mechanism in which cytosine bases  in CpG dinucleotides acquire methyl groups (-CH3) at their 5' position. This mechanism is conserved from bacteria, where it serves to differentiate between bacterial and viral genome, all the way to the higher organisms, such are mammals.  In mammalian genome there are places with higher than expected frequency of CpG dinucleotides, usually refered to as CpG islands and they are located mostly at gene promotors. There can be a higher frequency of CpG dinucleotides at regions containing transposable elements, but these are not usually reffered to as CpG islands.  Hyphermethylation of  CpG dinucleotides leads to silencing of transposable elements, specific gene silencing and may also be crucial in creating heterochromatin regions important in structural organization of DNA. Unbalanced methylation is  frequent in cancers. Whilst cancers can have a wide array of different pathologies, the most obsrerved pattern is generally hypomethylated genome, leading to expression of transposablke elements which can then embed themselves into other genes and disrupt their normal function. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions can also lead to abrupted structural organization of the nucleus  Structural organization of nucleolar DNA is an important regulator of gene expression, and moving tumour supressors to silent heterochromatin at nuclear perifery or inapropriate expression of protooncogenes after moving them intto the active parts of the nucleus, may be a crucial neoplastic change in cancer.   CpG islands at promotors of tumour supressor genes may be hyphermethylated, bringing about their silencing and disrupted control of cell cycle.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is epigenetic phenomenomn observed in  relatively small number of living beings : namely mammals and some plants. It is characterized by differential methylation patterns in female and male  reproductive cells and generally, female reproductive cells tend to silence the genes  coding for proteins that promote growth, whereas male reproductive cells tend to activate these genes, suggesting  a type of selection where males try to promote the growth of their offspring against the growth of other male's offspring, whereas female tries to limit that growth while the embryo is inside of her. Considering the role of these genes in competition for nutrients it is not surprising that they are often disregulated in cancer, giving cancer cells  selective advantage.  One example of imprinted regions is H19/Igf2 cluster.  It  consists of Igf2 gene, imprint control region (ICR) and H19 noncoding RNA.  In maternal copy, ICR is unmethylated and CTCF binds to it leading to exclusion of Igf2 gene from enhancers downstream of H19, whereas in the paternal copy, ICR is  methylated, CTCF doesn't bind  and it leads  to Igf2 expression.  Cells that constitute Wilm's tumour have two H19/Igf2 clusters imprinted in paternal fashion, which leads to their overgrowth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a chemical analog of cytidine and a hypomethylating agent. It is chemicaly similar to azatcitidine, another hypomethylating agent, but azacitidine is ribonucleotide whereas decitabine is deoxyribonucleotide. They both incorporate into DNA and when they encounter DNA methyltransferase, they make covalent bonds with it preventing furter DNA methylation. There are two possible ways deciabine could potentially have anti-tumour effect. It could either hypomethylate promotors of tumor supressor genes, leading to their reactivation or it could reactivate transposable elements, leading to greater genomic instability of tumour cells which might then undergo apoptosis. Since decitabine is incorporated into newly synthesised DNA, fast-dividing cancer cells are more susceptible  to its incorporation than normal cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is stable epigenetic alteration that is maintained through generations of cells and may last throughout the life. Maintenance DNA methyltransferase, DNMT1 has a high affinitiy for hemimethylated DNA and it can methylate each of the two newly created unmethylated DNA strands.  DNA methylation changes through the development ; shortly after fertilization paternal genome is actively demethylated whilst moternal genome is passively demethylated. In the blastocyst, cells have  the lowest level  of DNA methylation and after that they are undergoing new, tissue specific DNA methylation patterns.  The only genes that maintain their DNA methylation are the imprinted genes and these methylation marks must be erased and created <em>de novo</em> in germline. These periods of changes in DNA methylation are often reffered to as the sensitive periods and all the impacts in this period might have long lasting effects on an individual. So it is higly risky to alter them. </p>
<p>Also, many organs have stem cells that readily proliferate throughout the life, notably cells of intestine epithelium or germinative layer in  skin. Cancer cells show more sensitivity to demethylating agents because  they divide faster and they  incorporate cytidine analogs  faster than surrounding tissue does. Treating cancers that are in close proximity to normal cells that must rapidly divide with demthylating agents might pose a treat for creating new neoplastic changes. </p></div>
