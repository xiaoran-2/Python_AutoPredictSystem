    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is essential for gene expression. It is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, suppression of repetitive elements, and the formation of heterochromatin. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression.
<br /><br />DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer through hypermethylation. In many disease processes, such as cancer, gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing.
<br /><br />Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer through aberrations of epigenetic control in locus specific and genome hypermethylation. DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation to silence tumor suppressor genes. 
Hypermethylation of gene promoters can result in silencing of those genes. This type of epigenetic mutation is dangerous when genes that regulate the cell cycle are silenced, allowing cells to grow and reproduce uncontrollably
<br /><br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements include imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, suppression of repetitive elements, and the formation of heterochromatin.

<br /><br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is also disrupted in cancer through genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. The consequence of hypomethylation depends on location. Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions results in genomic instability including illegitimate  recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes.
<br /><br />The role of DNA methylation is context dependent Different tumours have different dependencies: (1) if driven by tumor suppressor hypermethylation, then depletion of DNA methylation appears to suppress tumorigenesis, (2) if  driven by chromosomal instability, then depletion of DNA methylation appears to enhance tumorigenesis’</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is a dynamic process. The process
of erasure and reprogramming in germline cells is necessary such that the germ
cell imprinting status is relevant to the sex of the individual. The paternal
imprint is associated with DNA methylation at the Imprint Control Region (ICR). </p><p>In the same manner, this Primordial Germ Cell process of
erasure and reprogramming results in a maternal Igf2 allele. However, the methylation pattern
of the maternal allele is such that it is not expressed.</p><p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth
restricting genes or an overexpression of growth promoting genes. Hypermethylation of Imprint Control Regions can result in the loss of imprinting.
In Wilm’s tumor, there is hypermethylation of the ICR resulting in Igf2
overexpression.<br /></p><p>The CTFC Transcriptional repressor protein CTCF plays a
heavy role in repressing the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene, by binding to
the H-19 imprinting control region. Binding of targeting sequence elements by CTCF can
block the interaction between enhancers and promoters, therefore limiting the
activity of enhancers to certain functional domains. In Wilm’s tumor, the hypermethylation of the ICR
results in an overexpression of Igf2.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of DNMT inhibitors. Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute
myelogenous leukaemia.</p>

<p>Decitabine acts as a hypomethylating agent. It is
incorporated into the DNA chain and hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA
methyltransferase. Cells in the presence of Decitabine incorporate it into DNA
during replication and RNA during transcription. The incorporation of
Decitabine into DNA or RNA inhibits methyltransferase thereby causing
demethylation in that sequence. This adversely affects the way that cell
regulatory proteins are able to bind to the DNA/RNA substrate. </p>

<p>Decitabine disrupts DNA synthesis. This
disruptive activity promotes cytotoxic DNA hypomethylation and apoptotic cell
death in rapidly dividing cells. DNA hypomethylation is achieved at concentrations
below those required to significantly inhibit DNA synthesis, which may promote
restoration of function to genes associated with control of cellular
differentiation and proliferation</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome through transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.  Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. This means that the marks of developmental history are unlikely to be caused by widespread somatic mutation. These processes which are less irrevocable than mutation fall under the umbrella term “epigenetic” mechanisms.<br /><br />A sensitive period in epigenetics is a period of epigenetic reprogramming: the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. 

DNA methylation is essential during embryonic development, and in somatic cells, patterns of DNA methylation are generally transmitted to daughter cells with a high fidelity. <br /><br />Sensitive periods of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance are the (1) DNA methylation cycle from Primordial Germ Cell through the gamete development and (2) DNA methylation from the fertilized egg to the blastocyst and epiblast.
<br /><br />There is concern in systemic treatment especially due to the critical role of epigenetic control in all other tissues that may result in unwanted side effects. Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because there is still a lack of knowledge of the specificity inherent to their mechanism of action and the possible long term effects on normal cells.</div>
