    <div class="field-value">For convenience in scoring, I decided to discuss the question point-by-point.<br /><br />1st- Although most CpG islands are unmethylated or hypomethylated in normal cells, normal  DNA methylation at CpG islands (along w/ methylation at non-CpG islands) is known to control tissue-specific transcription. Such normal function is also essential for X chromosome inactivation and in imprinting (differentially methylated regions in the vicinity of imprinted genes).<br /><br />2nd&amp;3rd- However in cancer cells, these regions which have normally unmethylated CpG islands are instead hypermethylated. Such hypermethylation in CpG islands leads to the suppression of the tumor suppressor genes, which leads to abnormal cell proliferation. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, daughter cells formed from the 'cancerous/mutated cell' will have the selective advantage of proliferating abnormally as well. This type of insult, together with other multiple hits (activation of oncogenes) will all contribute to cancer.<br /><br />4th- Normal DNA methylation or hypermethylation in these regions and elements serve to prevent genomic instability and prevent the transcription of these regions. <br /><br />5th&amp;6th- However in cancer cells, there is a genome-wide hypomethylation in these areas. Such hypomethylation would cause these DNA segments, most frequently in repeats, to have abnormal recombination, such that repeats making copies of themselves will have the capacity to insert themselves in the genome, some of which will disrupt certain genetic expression, but more crucially activate genes such as oncogenes and multiple insults of such will lead to cancer. Genomic instability that takes place as a result of this hypomethylation include deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1st-On the maternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is unmethylated. If this is unmethylated, an insulator protein called CTCF can bind to it, and such binding insulates Igf2 (Igf2's expression is not enhanced) by enhancers that are located downstream. In this case, the enhancers can now bind to a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19 and enhance its expression. <br /><br />2nd-On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated (normally paternally imprinted). If it is methylated, CTCF cannot bind to it and as a result, Igf2 expression is enhanced by the downstream enhancers. The absence of an insulator protein will also cause the methylation in the ICR to spread towards the promoter of the lncRNA, causing H19 to be silenced.<br /><br />3rd&amp;4th-In Wilm's tumour, there is a loss of imprinting in the sense that there is also hypermethylation taking place in the ICR on the maternal allele. As a result, Igf2 expression is enhanced while H19 is silenced. And since there are now two copies of the alleles having the same pattern of methylation, the production of Insulin-like growth factor2 (Igf2) doubles (and no dose of H19). And since it is a GROWTH FACTOR, it is growth promoting and such promotes the development of Wilm's tumour or cancer.<br /><br /> <br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1st-3rd points:<br /><br />Decitabine, as described in The Economist article, is a DNA-demethylating agent. More precisely, it is a type of DNMT inhibitor (DNMTi). As what I've learned, it is a nucleoside analog and it gets incorporated into the DNA of cells and inhibit DNA methylation by irreversibly binding to DNA methyltransferases. Since DNMT inhibitors are replication dependent, a cell must be constantly replicating and thus cancer cells which divide rapidly are more affected. DNMTi seem to work on hematological malignancies and this is thought so because such malignancies depend on tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation. This means that Decitabine's demethylating effect can re-activate the expression of tumor suppressor genes, hence it's anti-tumor effect.<br /> <br />However, an important consideration for DNMTi is the dosage as high doses can lead to toxic, nonspecific effects while low levels will yield optimal effect of DNA demethylation as observed in studies.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>1st-4th points<br /><br />DNA methylation is a feasible target in treatments because once it is manipulated, we are assured that the effects are permanent because as we have learned,  DNA methyltransferase enzymes will maintain these methyl mark patterns during subsequent cell divisions. <br /><br />However, these interventions may affect normal function of many cells and this has been shown to be true most especially during sensitive periods ­­- when epigenetic reprogramming is extensive or at its height. <br /><br />Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable for women who are pregnant as well as during periconception (period before conception) as epigenetic reprogramming, as discussed in Week 5, takes place in early embryonic development and during germ cell development.<br /><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
