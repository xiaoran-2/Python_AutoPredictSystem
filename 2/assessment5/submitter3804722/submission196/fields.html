    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG island localized in promotor region of gene, can be methylated, inactivating the expression of a gene, or can be unmethylated allowing the expression of a gene. Some stages can contribute to proliferation of cancer cells, as the inactivation of tumor suppressor  genes or the activation of oncogenes. In normal cells the intergenic regions or repetitive elements are silenced (methylated), changes of this situation can contribute to genomic instability due to illegitimate recombination among repeats, transposition or activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In a normal cell the
imprinted control región (ICR) of H19/igf2 cluster  is characterized by the unmethylation of
maternal allele and methylation of paternal allele. Under this situation only
the paternal allele can express the igf2 protein. This protein is involved in
growth promoting.  The Wilm´s tumor is
characterized by a hypermethylation of this ICR,  which results in a overexpression of Igf2 due
to both parental allele are expressing igf2 protein, this overexpression
contributes to tumor genesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to
DNA-demethylating agents, In some kinds of cancers, as lymphomas and other cancers of the immune sytem, some DNA regions related to tumor-suppresor genes are
overmethylated. This substance can reduce the level of methylation at this kind
of genes what can reduces the proliferation of tumour cells, having no apparent
effect on nearby normal cells</p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>A
sensitive period it is a period during which the epegenetics marks can be
cleared and reseted and furthermore can be transmitted transgenerationally. We
can identify two sensitive periods, the period of primordial germ cell
development ( through to the production of mature eggs and sperms) and the
period of pre-implantation and early post-implantation. </span></p></div>
