    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are usually not methylated in normal genome, but in cancer there is a gain of methylation at these sites. For these regions are sometimes close to tumor supressor genes promoters, CpG island methylation inhibits their expression contributing to cell transformation. CpG islands next to promoters of oncogenes, instead, are usually demethylated.<br />Normally, repetitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated. This inhibits their transcription through cryptic promoters and through promoters of transposable elements. In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated which leads to genomic instability through transcription of transposable elements and cromosomal rearrangements, These events can trigger aberrant patterns of gene expression contributing to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, a region upstream the Igf2 gene is not methylated so it is a viable site for binding of an insulator protein which inhibits transcription of Igf2 (localized downstream of this region) and enable the enhancers that are downstream of Igf2 to act on H19 thus promoting it's transcription.<br />In the maternal allele, the region upstream the Igf2 gene is methylated, so the insulator protein can't bind to the DNA. In this case, the enhancers that are downstream Igf2 aren't free to act on H19 and can act only in Igf2 causing it's transcription.<br />In a disease called Wilm's tumour, the affected individual may have one good paternal allele and one mutated maternal allele that behaves like a paternal one. So he ends with a duplicated product of H19 and no Igf2.<br />As H19 and Igf2 are involved in cell growth, impairment of this cluster have consequences on cell proliferation that may cause cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine may be used to treat cancer as it is a DNA-demethylating agent and therefore can invert the locus-specific gain of methylation so caracteristic of this group of diseases. Some of the regions hipermethylated in cancer are tumor supressor genes, so Decitabine may be used to restore the expression of such genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">During the process of cell division, one originally all-methylated locus on a double-strand of DNA becomes hemimethylated because of DNA duplication, but DNMT1 (which is an enzyme with affinity for hemimethylated DNA) can restore the methylated state on the non-methylated strand. Therefore, DNA methylation is an inheritable process and so are its effects.<br />There are periods of human development in which the DNA methylation patterns are reprogrammed and therefore are periods subject to errors or other interferences in this patterns. For this reason they are called sensitive periods. The two more important sensitive periods known are the early embryo development and the primordial germ cell (PGC) development.<br />Treatment of patients during such periods may cause effects that will be inherited by all the individual's cells or by the PGC's that will give birth to the individual's descendants. As some of these effects are undesirable for other periods of time that are not now, treatment in this condition turns not to be a good thing to do.</div>
