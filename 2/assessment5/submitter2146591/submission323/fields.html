    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is altered in cancer at both CpG islands and in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br /><br /><strong>CpG islands</strong> are often found at gene promoters and are generally unmethylated. When methylation does occur, the methylated CpG binds methylating proteins that silence gene expression by one of two mechanisms: either they possess a DNA binding domain or they inhibit transcription factor binding. In cancer, the frequency of methylation at CpG islands is much increased. This can lead to the silencing of tumour suppressor genes; in turn, this causes the cells to proliferate more rapidly and to be resistant to programmed cell death. The epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, that is the progeny of affected cells demonstrate the same methylation pattern. Such hypermethylation in cancer can also be found in the CpG islands associated with entire groups of adjacent genes.<br /><br />In contrast, in healthy tissue, <strong>intergenic regions </strong>and<strong> repetitive elements</strong> are heavily methylated. This maintains genomic stability by preventing illegitimate recombination between non-matching chromosome pairs where by chance the repetitive elements can align. It also hinders the movement of transposable elements within the genome and the consequent disruption of normal function. In cancer however and at an early stage in its development, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated and also lose the densely packed heterochromatin. Recombination between non-analogous chromosomes becomes possible and can result in chromosome abnormalities such as deletions, insertions &amp; reciprocal translations.  Moreover repeats are now free to make copies of themselves and flit around the genome, perhaps disrupting the transcription of normal genes or tumour suppressor genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On chromosome 11 in humans, the H19/Igf2 cluster comprises the H19 gene, the Imprint Control Region (ICR), the Igf2 gene and downstream enhancers.<br /><br />The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted. Therefore, on the <strong>paternal allele</strong>, the ICR is methylated. The downstream enhancers act on the Igf2 gene which is responsible for a growth promoting protein. H19 is not expressed on the paternal allele because of methylation spread from the ICR.<br /><br />On the <strong>maternal allele</strong>, the ICR is unmethylated and consequently open to bind an insulator protein, CTCF. CTFC physically shields the Igf2 gene from the downstream enhancers; instead, as a second best, they act on the H19 gene which is expressed.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, there is loss of imprinting because the ICR becomes hypermethylated, and so the maternal allele demonstrates the same methylation and gene expression patterns as the paternal allele. On both alleles, rather than just the paternal, Igf2 is expressed, leading to a double dose of the growth promoting protein and a tumour in the kidney. (H19 expression is reduced with uncertain consequences.)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an example of a DNA-demethylating agent. It acts by inhibiting the DNA methyltransferase enzymes which replicate the cytosine methylation pattern on the daughter DNA strand in mitotic cell division. <br /><br />The DNA demethylating agents are analogues of cytidine nucleosides and are incorporated into DNA as a substitute for cytidine itself. At cell division, they bind the DNA methyltransferase irreversibly so that the chemical reaction cannot be completed and the enzyme reused. The nett effect is a hypomethylation reversing the hypermethylation associated with cancer. They probably act on all dividing cells but are particularly effective against more rapidly dividing cells such as tumour cells. The daughter cells may be stripped of the cancer-related hypermethylation and so behave more normally. They may also be rendered susceptible to apoptosis and killed by the body's natural defence mechanisms.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is one type of the epigenetic marks that are mitotically heritable, that is, once laid down, they are preserved through all subsequent cell divisions for the life of the organism. There is some suggestion that they may even persist into future generations.<br /><br />At sensitive periods, the epigenetic marks are removed and then laid down from scratch, resulting in re-programming. The two sensitive periods in mammals are the pre-implantation &amp; early post-implantation development of the embryo and the development of primordial germ cells, the latter occurring thoughout sexual maturity in spermatogenesis and prenatally in oogenesis with later maturation of the ova. Methylation patterns are also changed locally during tissue differentiation.<br /><br />Treating patients at sensitive periods can have serious consequences as any effects can affect the entire cleared epigenome and and will be maintained through all future cell divisions. Early embryos of a pregnant mother being treated will be highly vulnerable. The germ cells of female foetuses and pre-pubertal males are also especially sensitive to epigenetic modifications that will reveal themselves in the next generation.</div>
