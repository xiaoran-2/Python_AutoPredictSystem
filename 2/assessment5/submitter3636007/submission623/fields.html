    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Imprinted
genes are typically involved in either cell growth promoting or cell growth
suppressing.  Hypomethylation of cell
growth promoting genes can cause their overexpression and hypermethylation of
cell growth suppressing genes can cause their under expression.  The imprinting control region of the Igf2 gene
cluster is normally methylated (leading H19 to be unexpressed and Igf2 to be
expressed) on the paternal chromosome and not methylated (causing H19 to be
expressed and Igf2 to be unexpressed) on the maternal chromosome.  </span></p><p>

</p><p><span>In
Wilm’s tumor, there is hypermethylation of the ICR on both the paternal and
maternal chromosmes.  This leads to
overexpression of Igf2, since it is now expressed on both chromosomes and under
expression of H19 since it is not expressed on either.  Since Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, its
overexpression leads or can lead to increased cell growth and reproduction,
which in turn leads to tumor formation.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation
normally helps silence transcription in a mitotically heritable way, but CpG
islands are not normally methylated. CpG
islands are normally either not methylated or are hypomethylated, but in
cancerous cells they become hypermethylated, i.e. more likely to be methylated
than normal. <span>Cpg islands are often found in the promoters of tumor suppressor gene,
which code for proteins that help prevent cancer by either regulating the cell
cycle (and prevent unneeded cell divisions) or promote apoptosis in damaged or
cancer bound cells.  Since
hypermethylation of the promoter typically silences transcription, the cell
loses these proteins and is more likely to become cancerous.</span></p><p>

</p>

Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated, to
help stabilize the genome by preventing transposons from becoming active.  <span>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions allows increased recombination
between repeated elements and allows transposons to become active both of which
promote genome instability.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:15.75pt;background:#FFFFFF;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica, 'sans-serif';color:#333333;">Decitabine
is a DNA-demethlating drug, which means it can change the epigenetic structure
of a chromosome by removing methyl groups from hypermethylated DNA
regions.<span>  </span>Since one of the hallmarks of
tumors is the hypermethylation of CpG islands (and CpG island shores) of tumor
suppressor genes, causing their reduced expression.<span>  </span>A DNA-demethlating drug like Decitabine could
remove the excessive methyl groups and allow an increased expression of these
tumor suppressor genes.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Although
epigenetic modifications may silence a gene, the gene itself is still there and
functional, so the silencing is reversible (unlike a mutation).  Since epigenetic modifications are
mitotically heritable, they are passed down to daughter cells during
division.  Using a drug that modifies the
epigenetic changes can then also be passed down to daughter cells, allowing for
reactivation of the gene on a wider scope. 
Many chemotherapy drugs work by attempting to kill the cancer cells and
many of the inactivated genes in the cancer cell promote apoptosis.  Epigenetic drugs that reactivate the
apoptosis genes may make the affected cancer cells more susceptible to
traditional drugs by allowing apoptosis to occur.  Sensitive
periods are time frames during development when the epigenetic and imprinting
markers are being reprogrammed.  Treating
during these times may affect the epigenome of normal cells, as well as
cancerous ones.</span></p>
