    <h1>Submission 440 from Anon (session_user_id: 6257b7e575ca1b06220e8990d437db3b12920b3d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl-transferase inhibitor. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (cancer of the immune system) where tumour-suppressor genes are over-methylated and this over-methylation results in them being silenced and unable to suppress tumour cells and this leads to uncontrolled cell growth. By reducing the methylation of these genes, their silencing effect is reduced and they are more fully expressed allowing them to suppress tumour cells.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that target the epigenome can have a last effect on cancer cells making them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. This is because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so the DNA methylation is passed onto daughter cells when the cells divide. This epigenetic state lasts until the methylation is actively erased.</p><p>There are sensitive periods when the epigenome may be influenced by an altered environment. These periods are embryogenesis (pre and post implantation periods of the embryo) and gametogenesis (period from primordial germ cell development through to production of mature eggs and sperm).</p><p>Treating patients with such epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods is inadvisable as it may lead to birth defects in children. According to information on dacogen (<a title="Link: http://www.drugs.com/dacogen.html" href="http://www.drugs.com/dacogen.html">http://www.drugs.com/dacogen.html</a>) fathers should use condoms while on the medication and for at least two months after stopping the drug. Mothers should not take the drug if pregnant, use effective birth control measures and avoid breast-feeding.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA is normally hypomethylated (reduced levels of methylation) at CpG islands. However, in cancer, these same CpG islands become hypermethylated. This leads to silencing of the underlying gene. When such genes are tumour suppressing genes then silencing the promoters of these genes may lead to cancer since cancer cells can no longer be supressed. </p><p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated. However, in cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements lose their methylation and become hypomethylated. This leads to genomic instability and can be evidenced by a) illegitimate combinations between repeats, b) activation of repeats and transposition and c) activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Such genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer and is known to promote tumorigenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated which blocks the binding of the CTCF (an insulator protein). Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to the H19 gene promoter and this allows the enhancers to access the lgf2 gene and activate it.</p><p>On the maternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is not methylated so attracts the CTCF insulation protein. This then allows the H19 gene to be active and the enhancers now work on enhancing the H19 gene (rather than the lgf2 gene). This leads to the lgf2 gene not being expressed.</p><p>Since most imprinted alleles have genes relating to growth (either growth promoting or growth suppressing) aberrant methylation can lead to cancer. With the H19/lg2 cluster, hyper-methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele leads to the lgf2 gene (a growth promoter) being expressed on both the paternal AND the maternal allele and this leads to Wilm's tumour.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>
