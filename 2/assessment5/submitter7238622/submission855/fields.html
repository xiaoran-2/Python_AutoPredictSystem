    <h1>Submission 855 from Anon (session_user_id: e9512a4805592ed611b30c7fb5119870d39bff42)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The DNA methylation is a process that take
place during the cell life, but this kind of chemical modifications can be
transmitted to the offspring of the cell. The epigenetic changes can pass
trough  the cell division, maintain the
same epigenetic character like the mother and the grandmother.  The problem comes when the epigenetic state
has been induced to a wrong epigenetic state, which becomes transmissible to
the offspring.</span></p>

<p><span>There is some specific periods, that are called
sensitive periods, during these the epigenome redistribute the epigenetic
marks. These periods take place twice during the life of an organism. The firs
sensitive period corresponds to the primordial state of an embryo, and the
second, during the creation of gametes. These two periods have been
characterized to take off the epigenetic marks, 
for this way the use of epigenetic treatments during this period would
be fatidic. If the conditions during epigenome modulation would change by a drug,
the parental cells pass this error producing ill offspring.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, whose active drug
is azacitadine, is an agent that produces DNA demethylation. If that drug demethylates
DNA producing the expression of anti-oncogenes and avoiding the cancer.</p>

<p>The obtained knowledge during
the course lets us know that demethylateing CpG islands, the expression of the near
genes by the recognition of the transcription factors of the area in promoted.
One of the cancer effects is the hypermethylation of the CpG islands and
hypomethilation the wide DNA. If decitabine removes methyl groups, it leads to
cell to avoid the cancer by the expression of anti-oncogenes.</p>

<p><span>There is another effect like
the expression of gene Myc. This gene is part of the DNA regulatory system. In
both cases the drug avoids the effect of EZH2, which produces cancer by
hypermethylation in promoters of supressor-genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>One characteristic  in cancer cells is the hypermethylation of the
CpG islands. This kind of system wards off the expression of genes which are just
after the CpG islands.</span></p>

<p>The disrupting of imprinted
epigenetic state like hyper or hipomethylation produces the loss of the
expression in specific growth restricting genes. In contrast, this effect
promotes the overexpression of growth promoting genes inducing a tumour cell.</p>

<p>All the effects named before
take place because of the hypermethylation of H19. In a normal cell the
paternal chromosome has hypermethylation on the H19, the enhancers won't be
expressed and so the Igf2 remains active. Otherwise occurs on the maternal
chromosome, which doesn’t have methylations on H19 and avoids the cancer
expressing the enhancers and compensating the expression of Igf2.</p>

<p><span>The disruption of this system
produces Wilm's tumour. This tumour appears when the mother's chromosome is
hypermethylated. The hypermethylation avoids the expression of the enhancers and
promote the Igf2 like in the male chromosome which results in an overexpression
of Igf2.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On a regular and non-cancerous
cell, the epigenetic marks are situated on CpG islands and intergenic and
repetitive DNA. The CpG islands show less methylations that allow the expression
of later genes. On the other hand, the wide DNA, which includes intergenic
regions and repetitive DNA, is usually methylated.</p>

<p>The normal function of DNA
methylation in wide DNA is to maintain the genomic stability. This kind of
methylations allows the correct separation of chromatides and avoids problems
like illegitimate recombination. When the cancer appears, the enzymes involved
in the methylation or demethylation are altered. This fact produces a global hypomethylation
on DNA and as a conclusion genomic instability, such as illegitimate
recombination, insertions or deletions, inducing the cell becomes cancerous.</p>

<p><span>Otherwise, the normal function
of methylations at CpG islands is to let the expression of nearest genes, because
when this specific region becomes methylated the enzymes which function is to
transcribe the nearest genes can't do their function. The near genes of the CpG
islands are enhancers that promote the transcription of anti-oncogenes or
regulatory systems. When the cancer appears, as the case of wide DNA, the
enzymes induce hypermethylation at the CpG islands. This methylations avoids
the expression of the enhancers also the correct regulation, so it produces a
bad regulation of the oncogenes in the cell.</span></p></div>
