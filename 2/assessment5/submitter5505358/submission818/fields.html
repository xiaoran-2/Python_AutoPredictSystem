    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">Usually CpG islands are free of methylation which is necessary for normal promotion of genes situated nearby them. But in cancer cells in DNA, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated that as consequence provokes silencing of nearby genes. If these genes for example are tumor supressors - it causes uncontrolled cell division. The function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetetive elements is to maintain genomic stability through silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, illegitimate recombination. In this case hypomethylation, which is observed during cancer, make genome instable and susceptible for different abberations of normal gene expression. Of course it leads to uncontrolled cell division finally...</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF protein and allows enhancers to access lgf2. On the maternal allele CTCF protein binds to ICR and provokes enhancers to activate H19 gene. So we have single transcription of both genes. But in tumor, particularly Wilm's tumor ICR of maternal allele is hypermethylated and as consequence, there occurs double expression of lgf2 gene. It's associated with kidney tumor in children. So It's obvious in this case that lgf2 is growth promoting gene and H19 is growth supressing gene.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents which can decrease level of genome methylation. It can be happened so that overactivity of methylating enzymes unnormally covers tumor supressor genes and provokes uncontrolled cell division. In this case demethylating activity of decitabine can be usefull in preventing of silencing these tumor supressor genes and decreasing of tumor cells number.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so cells treated with altering DNA methylation drugs can maintain new level of methylation during some period of time. Althought there are stages of organism development when cells itself provide epigenomic alterations: primordial germ cells and early embryonic development. Earlier methylation marks are errased and new are installed. While these changes drugs that act on epigenome totally can provoke too huge and negative consequences on future gene expression. </div>
