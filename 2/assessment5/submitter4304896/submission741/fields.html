    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is responsible for the normal functioning of several epigenetic occurrences including X chromosome inactivation, imprinting and the formation of heterochromatin. In normal functioning cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated meaning DNA methylation is absent while intergenic and repeatitive elements are hypermethylated and this helps in the proper functioning in order to ensure the expression of down stream genes. However, DNA hypermethylation can occur in CpG islands in the promoter region and intergenic and repeatitive elements are hypermethylated which leads to cancer formation as there is silencing of important genes involved in tumor suppression are prevented from being expressed while onco genes are expressed. <p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprinted control region(ICR) is hypomethylated on the maternal allele while it is methylated on the paternal allele. As the maternal ICR is not methylated, CTFC protein insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers hence silencing the expression of Igf2 gene on the maternal allele. On the paternal allele, the enhancers have direct access to the Igf2 as there is no insulator for the Igf2 genes and hence the downstream enhancers leads to the expression of the Igf2 gene on the paternal genome. Wilm's tumor as well as cancer results when the is upregulation of the Igf2 gene which is onco gene and this happens when there is mutations or deletion in the region causing epigenetic lost of imprinted gene and hence having two forms of the paternal allele and lost of the maternal allele. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the epigenetic inhibitor DNA-demethylation. Decitabine will stop DNA methylation of promoter regions of tumor suppresor genes in order to ensure proper expression of these genes. Decitabine anti-tumor effect is in its contribution to DNA-demethylation and the slowing of tumor growth. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alteration of DNA methylation can have lasting effect as epigentic changescan have an accumulated effect throughout the genome during development and can be passed from daughter to granddaughter cells. Epigenetic reprogramming have sensitive periods  and the memory can help erased the<br />Sensitive period is the period between PC when epigenetic reprogramming is strong. </div>
