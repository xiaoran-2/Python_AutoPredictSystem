    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is the regulation of gene expression, and there is a correlation between transcriptional repression of a particular gene and the methylation of the associated CpG dinucleotides (also known as gene silencing). DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted by cancer because there are abnormal epigenetic signaling pathways that arise, and both hypo- and hypermethylation are associated with human tumors. Demethylation may cause aberrant activation of certain genes important for cancer growth (oncogenes) and chromosome instability. Hypermethylation is associated with transcriptional silencing of the tumor suppressor genes, which causes these important genes that normally tell cells when to stop dividing to become inactivated (they lose their normal cellular function). Normally, promotor regions at the CpG islands remain unmethylated which allows for a lot of transcriptional activity and histone modifications, but in cancer these regions are hypermethylated and gene expression is repressed. Also, hypomethylation of chromatin including intergenic regions and repetitive elements is associated with cancer and aberrant behavior. Methylation at repetitive elements is normally for maintaining chromosome structure and stability, as well as silencing the expression of parasitic DNA elements. Methylation of these regions is also important for correct tissue-specific gene expression. Therefore, not having proper methylation changes in these areas can lead to a variety of problems.  The hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells leads in genomic instability and copying errors (insertions, deletions, translocations, etc. of chromosomes).  In sum, normal functioning cells have CpG islands hypomethylated, with intergenic regions and repetitive elements hypermethylated. In cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.                     </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 is only expressed from the allele inherited from the father; it is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele, meaning it is paternally imprinted.  H19 (a long non-coding RNA) is being produced from the maternal allele, however this doesn't have anything to do with the imprinting of this particular cluster. this imprint control region is actually bound by CTCF (an insulator protein) which enhances the H19 expression on the maternal allele.  On the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated and CTCF now cannot bind and acts on the Igf2 instead, promoting its expression. Therefore, H19 is no longer active on the paternal allele. Wilm's tumor is associated with increased methylation, leading to reduced expression, from the maternal copy of the H19 locus.  This means H19 expression is silenced and Igf2 is activated on the maternal allele, when it should be H19 promoted and Igf2 blocked.  Disruption if imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster alters the regulation of the genes: the loss of H19 activity (which normally restrains growth) and the increase in Igf2 activity (which promotes growth) leads to overgrowth and greater risk for tumors in certain populations.         </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent (or DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and even anemia.  As the class of drugs it belongs to implies, Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.  This process of demethylation is hoped to restore function to the tumor suppressor genes and help control the  uncontrolled cell growth characteristic of cancer.  This drug is also an antimetabolite which aids in producing an cytotoxic effect in the cancer cells, causing them to die off (apoptosis induction).  The drug is hoped to help the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and kills abnormal cells in the bone marrow.   </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic signals are fundamental to normal human development, and epigenetic abnormalities are known to underlie several important diseases. Epigenetic alterations are reversible, and drugs can target epigenetic machinery.  DNA methyltransferase enzymes retain their methylation marks during cell division (mitosis), so altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects in the epigenome.  However, there could be issues with this during the so-called sensitive periods where there are important periods of extensive epigenetic reprogramming (clearing and establishing epigenetic marks during development). It would be inadvisable to treat mothers before conception (a few months before wanting to become pregnant), pregnant mothers, and young children.  This is because a lot of this occurs during early infant and childhood development and during the formation of gametes.    </div>
