    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands results in gene silencing and the formation of a repressive chromatin structure. Generally most CpG islands tend to be protected from excessive DNA methylation. This is deregulated in cancer: hyper methylation is often observed and this happens in the promoters of Tumour suppressor genes leading to their inactivation.<br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are often methylated and the role of methylation here is to preserve genomic stability, through silencing of cryptic transcription and splicing sites, avoidance of transposition and illegitimate recombinations. In cancer genome wide hypomethylation occurs, and this is characteristic in these regions, leading to genomic instability through loss of the protective mechanisms described above.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a Dnmt inhibitor: it is a nucleoside analogue which is incorporated in the DNA and irreversibly binds DNMT permanently deactivating it. Dnmt is necessary both for de novo methylation and, most important, to permit methylation of the new DNA chains after Dna replication, thus preserving methylation marks. In cancer there is often hyper methylation of Tumour suppressor genes, leading to their deactivation. Decitabine can thus restore methylation status and reactivate those Tumour suppressor genes, acting its antitumour effect. It is mainly active in hematological malignancies, and this could relate to the high level of duplication, leading to greater dependence on DNMT for preservance of methylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The h19/igf2 cluster is a typical case of imprinting with enhancer blocking. CTCF is a protein that blocks Igf2 from downstream promoters. When imprinting control region is methylated Ctcf cannot bind to its binding place and igf2 can be activated by downstream promoters. Normally the paternal allele is methylated, with the methylation extending even downstream to h19 promoter and silencing it, whilst permitting enhancers to access IGF2. The opposite is normally true for the maternal allele which is normally unmethylated. Disrupting methylation status of the maternal allele (thus is to say if it becomes methylated) leads to production of igf2 from both DNA strands, and this an overproduction. Igf2 is an oncogene and it's overdose is related to childhood tumors such as Wilms Tumour </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation status is maintained after a cell division due to an enzyme, DNMT1, which reads the methylation status of the original DNA strand and "copies" it to the daughter strand. Thus altered methylation status, and therefore regulation of gene expression is inherited to subsequent cell generations. <br />There are two main periods of epigenetic reprogramming: early in the development of the embryo and then again during the development of the gametes. During these two periods most epigenetic marks, such as these inherited by the parents are erased and then reestablished. During these two periods treatment with such drugs can heavily alter the epigenetic status of a developing organism (or, in the case of the gametes lead to defective epigenetic status of the gametes and thus of the subsequent embryo in the next generation) and should bee treated with caution.</div>
