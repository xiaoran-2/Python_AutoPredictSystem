    <h1>Submission 204 from Anon (session_user_id: 3847567e4058bc3d6ab1191758a9bfc4f751ea94)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, acting through irreversible DNMT binding. It binds to DNA during replication, DNMT1 is bound irreversibly to decitabine and cannot be released. This way, DNMT1 cannot methylate the daughter DNA strand. Since cancer cells are replicating rapidly and this effect is replication dependent, cancer cells are affected predominantly.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome as it is mitotically heritable. Sensitive periods are those of active epigenetic marks remodelling, as preimplantation and early post implantation periods and primordial germ cell development. Treating patients during these periods would be inadvisable since treatment could affect normal tissues and, through transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, also their offspring.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer as it can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. <br />In the Igf2 example, the ICR is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. The maternal allele is not accesible to enhancers as CTCF binds the ICR, so Igf2 is expressed in the paternal chromosome but not in the maternal one. <br />However, in Wilm's tumour the ICR at the maternal allele is hypermethylated, with subsequent overexpression of Igf2. Since Igf2 is a growth control gene, its overexpression contributes to cancer cell spread.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to gene silencing. In cancer, there can be hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumour supressor genes, which leads to gene silencing and tumour growth.<br />DNA methylation in repetitive elements and intergenic regions is necessary to maintain genomic stability. Hypomethylation of these regions leads to genomic instability and this enhances cell growth and tumorigenesis.<br /></div>
