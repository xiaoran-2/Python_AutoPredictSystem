    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are normally hypo- or sometimes, non-methylated, which probably is related to their function in cell cycle control (which would include normal end of cell life processes, or apoptosis), and repair of DNA. In the case of the development of cancer, CpG islands are seen to be hypermethylated. This hypermethylation of CpG islands probably has a silencing effect on tumor suppressor genes. Without this tumor suppression, cancer cell changes freely continue, and may even be selected for. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements normally helps to maintain the expressed or silent (opened or closed) function of the gene: demethylated in active genes; methylated in silenced genes. In cancer, there is usually global DNA demethylation. Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements may lead to overexpression of some genes, and a loss of the physically ordered nature of the chromosomes that is necessary for proper expression and functioning of the cells, and of the cells' life spans.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the insulator model of imprinting, in the paternal allele, methylation at the imprinting control region (ICR) prevents CTCF from binding with the insulator, and this allows interaction with enhancers to express the Igf2 gene. In the maternal allele, CTCF binds to sites at the imprinting control region, and serves as an insulator protein which insulates Igf2 from the enhancers. In someone with Wilm's tumour, there is a loss (or "relaxing of imprinting") of imprinting that causes the maternal allele to act like the paternal allele, resulting in an upregulation, or "overdose," of Igf2. That is, there is an abnormal activation of the normally repressed maternal allele. Disrupting the imprinting in this way allows normally repressed genes to become expressed in ways that promote oncogenes, or other growth-promoting, and cancer-promoting activities in the cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (brand name Dacogen), belongs to the class of epigenetic drugs that are DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine works by reducing the overmethylation (in the case of cancer) of histones and that has silenced genes such as tumor-suppressor genes, allowing cancer cells to proliferate. Treatment with decitabine reduces histone overmethylation, reducing cancer cell proliferation. The demethylating effects of decitabine may also leave the cancer cells more susceptible to regular chemotherapeutic agent treatment. Also, once altered (by an agent like decitabine), the new epigenetic marks are passed along during cell division to future generations of cells. Therefore, treatment with an epigenetic treatment agent like Decitabine holds the promise of being able to make a beneficial change that can continue forward for the patient.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Once the DNA methylation is altered, the new epigenetic markings do seem to be passed down to future generations of cells in a fairly stable way. It may be that yet-to-be discovered mechanisms in the nucleus environment help to maintain this stability. However, there are developmental periods that are "sensitive" and when there is greater potential for disruption in the passing along of the appropriated epigenetic marks. Sensitive periods seem to include pre- and post-natal development of an offspring, and also during primordial germ cell development. During these sensitive periods, epigenetic marks are erased and later reestablished. Treatment with agents that can alter methylation or acetylation may interfere with the appropriated epigenetic re-marking</div>
