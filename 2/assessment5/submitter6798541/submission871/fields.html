    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell what we can see are hypomethylated CpG islands and generally methylated repetitive elements and intergenic regions. However, in cancer cells CpGs are likely to be methylated and the rest of the genome is hypomethylated (repetitive elements and intergenic regions).<br /><br />The normal cell is hypomethylated in their CpGs because the methylation in a gene is mutagenic and causes gene silencing. We want the repetitive elements and intergenic regions to be methylated, because silencing these elements maintain the genomic stability and prevent transpositions.<br /><br />The hypermethylation in CpG islands silences tumour suppresor genes. It has been recognised that DNA methylation can be one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis (It says cancer is the result of multiple hits to DNA). The hypomethylation of some CpG promoters can result in activation of oncogenes.<br /><br />In cancer cells the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated, then these elements can cause genomic instability.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell the imprinting control region H19/Igf2 on the paternal allele is methylated. When the allele is unmethylated (in the maternal allele) CTCF protein binds to its insulator element and the enhancers can act on H19, but Igf2 is silenced (we do not see expression).<br /><br />On the paternal allele because it is methylated, the enhancers can act on Igf2 and it is expressed.<br /><br />On Wilm´s tumour the cell has the maternal allele methylated, so the maternal allele expresses Igf2. Igf2 is double expressed and promotes growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNMT-1. It is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly brinds DNMT-1 after they are incorporated into DNA, therefore replication dependent.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Sensitive periods: periods when the epigenetic marks are being established in a cell (for example, in the early development of the embryo and the establishment of epigenetic marks in gametes), and not when these marks are maintained. It is not advisable to treat younger patients during sensitive periods, particularly those that have developing germ cells.<br /></div>
