    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><pre><code></code></pre>CpG islands tend to be protected from DNA methylation in normal cells, in other words, largely unmethylated. This allows the promoter to act and cause expression of the gene. The intergenic regions, repetitive elements and introns are generally methylated.<br /></li></ul>In cancer CpG islands are methylated or hyper methylated which effectively blocks the promoter and silences the expression of tumor suppressor genes, thus allowing growth, potentially uncontrolled. The intergenic and repetitive elements and introns are hypo methylated in cancer, a swap of methylation from normal cells. <br />Cancer can be caused by activation of oncogenes genetically, or by inactivation of tumor suppressors by epigenetically silencing. The benefit of the cause being of epigenetic origin is that epimutations are reversible.<br />There are two types of DNA methylation abnormalities: Hypermethylated CpG islands (CGI's) and Hypo methylated intergenic regions, repetitive elements, and introns.<br /><br />I am sorry for the bullet point mark at the beginning, can't figure out how to get rid of it.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele in the H19/Igf2 cluster. H19 is silenced.This allows the enhancers to act on Igf2 and the gene is expressed. On the maternal allele the ICR, imprint control region is unmethylated, the enhancers act on H19 to promote expression while Igf2 is silent.<br />Imprinting is disrupted by hyper methylation of the CpG islands in the ICR.<br />With loss of imprinting Igf2 is expressed from both allele's, a double dose of Igf2, a gene associated with growth, resulting in Wilm's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is in the class of DNA demethylating agents.  It apparently helps to demethylate and allow expression where there had been previous silencing,and possibly slow tumor growth. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. It has been somewhat successful against solid tumors, and even where the response was not significant in the trials, apparently has aided in good reaction to standard chemotherapy. This suggests that it's possible epigenetic drugs may change tumor cells somehow that allows them to be more responsive to standard chemotherapy.<br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that affects the expression of the genes, including tumor suppressor genes.<br />A sensitive period is when epigenetic  marks are being established, during germ cell development and early embryonic development.<br />Studies have indicated there may be a "grandmother effect", where environmental changes, diet, possibly drugs used, during pregnancy can affect not only the mid-gestation fetus but also their germ cells which are being developed for the next generation.<br />Since epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, changes in the DNA methylation can affect more than one generation. Treating patients during sensitive periods may have consequences in future generations.</div>
