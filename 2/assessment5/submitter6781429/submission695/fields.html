    <h1>Submission 695 from Anon (session_user_id: d304383e906ef30894e1c2fd22102e9553e2ab41)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to
class epigenetic inhibitors DNA-demethylating. Decitabine demethylated the tumor-suppressor
genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that cause cancer.<br /><br />
If Decitabine demethylated the tumor-supressor genes, these can regulate the
growth of the cells. Decitabine is nucleoside analogs, so it gets incorporated
into the DNA upon replication. When the DNA methyltransferase comes along to
bind it, the DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the
methylation to the daughter strand that DNA methyltransferase is bound
irreversibly and it can no longer be released. And this means that the action
of these DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent so you have to
have the cell replicating. So, it could get a normal growth cellular and cancer
could disappear. In addition, these epigenetic changes could pass on during
cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period
of drug treatment because the drugs changes epigenetic modifications on genome
and these modifications pass on the next generation through mitosis.</p>

<span>A sensitive period is a period that altered
environments have an effect on epigenetic control. And there are two sensitive
periods in embryos development:  <br /></span><ul><li><b>Primordial
gem cell development</b></li><li><b>Early development</b></li></ul>In this two periods is cleared and resetted of epigenetic marks. In addition, paternal and maternal genomes are treated differently and other specific regions of the genome undergo varitan epigenetic reprograming (repetitive elements amd imprinted genes).  So, it shouldn't be to treated patients during these periods because if we treat them with drugs, we can change their epigentic marks and we can produce a wrong epigenetic reprogramming and it could cause diferents diseases such as cancer. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG islands are usually unmethylated, so the normal function of DNA
methylation at CpG islands is to active the expression of the associated genes.
This is because the CpG islands are free of methylation.  In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to
become hypermethylated (genetic mutation), which then causes silencing the
expression of underlying genes such as tumor-suppressor genes.  If the tumor-supressor genes are inactive in
cancer, cells will be dividing constantly. This can cause a cancer.</p>

<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated, so the
normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive
elements is to silence their expression (Heterochromatin). In addition, DNA methylation
in these regions maintains genomic stability. Because DNA methylations prevent
transposition of repeats, mutations of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent
transposition, it avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and
the methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination. Moreover,
DNA methylation at intergenic regions silences cryptic transcription start
sites.</p>

<p>In a cancer cell, we can see hypomethylation at intergenic regions and
repeats cause genomic instability. The genomic instability causes illegitimate
recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition,
activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. All these
features contribute with increase genomic instability and progression of
cancer.   </p>

<p>Finally, I want to say that changes in DNA methylation can include a
genome-wide loss and regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes instability
and deregulation of tissues specific and imprinted genes and silencing of tumor
suppressor-genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the ICR of Igf2 (growth factor) is unmethylated in maternal allele. When
it’s unmethylated CTCF binds in ICR and it mean that the enhancers will act on
H19 and H19 will be expressed. But Igf2 will be silent, we won't see expression, in
maternal allele. On the other hand, in a
normal cell, the ICR of Igf2 is methylated in paternal allele causing
the expression of Igf2 because CTCF isn’t binding to inhibit it. </p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs can result in loss of expression of
growth restriction genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. For example,
in Wilm’s tumor there are a hypermethylation of ICR in maternal allele and it will be expressed Igf2 (loss of imprinting). So, you have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison with
a normal cell. The overexpression of this growth factor produces an anormal
cellular division (tumor).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
