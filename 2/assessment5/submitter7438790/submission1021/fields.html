    <div class="field-value"> Hypermethylation of CpG islands in highly related to silencing of that gene on the other hand hypomethylation may relate to both activation and silencing of genes. CpG islands near promoter regions are mostly hypomethylated in normal cells whereas in tumor, CpG island are hypermethylated. Hypermethylation of CpG island progresses with cancer progression. Silencing of tumor suppressor  genes by methylation acts as secondary mechanism to silence tumor suppressor gene in addition to mutation of tumor suppressor resulting is uncontrolled cell growth. Moreover, methylation is very stable and it is mitotically heritable. Thus, silencing of tumor suppressor genes will passed to daughter cells resulting in rapid tumor progression. Methylation pattern is maintained throughout life.<br />In normal cells most of the genomic regions such as intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated whereas in cancer, these genomic regions becomes hypomethylated. Hypermethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements inhibits the various  repetitive elements to jump around the genome causing mutations such as translocation, point mutation, insertion, deletion, non-homologues recombination and irregular expression of genes through cryptic promoter. Thus it maintains genomic stability whereas in tumor cells, hypomethylation of these regions is the main cause of  genomic instability and  mutation leading inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and irregular activation oncogenes. Hypomethylation of genomic regions causes chromosome instability because of loss of methylation near centromere resulting in polyploidy in cancer cells. hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters such as in case of oncogenes will result irregular activation leading to cancer progression. Thus, acts as a secondary mechanism of oncogene activation other than genetic mutation. Activation of gene expression through cryptic promoter in intergenic regions and introns as well as irregular splicing may cause contribution to genomic instability and  cancer progression. Genomic instability also causes irregular expression of other non-coding RNA resulting contributing more to genomic instability.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">in normal cells, in the paternal allele, the CpG island in the H19/Igf2 cluster remains hypermethylated. As a result, CTCF which acts as insulator to enhancer binding, unable to bind  h19/Igf2 CpG island. As result enhancer is now free to bing Igf2 promoter(usual partner) and activates the expression of Igf2 but not H19. Whereas in maternal allele, because of the lack of methylation of this CpG island causes CTCF to bind and insulate the binding of the enhancer to Igf2 and activates its expression. Enhancer now activates H19 instead Igf2. Thus,  Igf2 which is oncogene is paternally expressed whereas H19 which inhibits growth is maternally expressed. Therefore a balanced is maintained between oncogene and tumor suppressor gene in normal cells<br />In Wilm's tumor, because of the hypermethylation of CpG island, even the CpG island in the maternal allele gets methylated. As a result, CTCF unable to bind and prevent the enhancer to activate the transcription of Igf2. This causes expression of Igf2 (which is a oncogene) from both the alleles and no expression of H19(which is tumor suppressor gene). Resulting in disruption of imprinting, balance between oncogene  and tumor suppressor and uncontrolled cell growth causing Wilm's Tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA Methyltranferase Inhibitor which prevents DNMT such as DNMT1 and DNMT3 to methylate the DNA. It is a nucleoside analog such as azacytidine and is dependent upon cell division and replication for its action. When DNMT binds to decitabine, it becomes ireversibly bound to it as a result it cannot methylate newly synthesize DNA strand, resulting in reduction in DNA methylation as DNA replicates. Prevention of DNA methylation by DNMT by decitabine thus prevents hypermethylation of the CpD island which in turn prevents silencing of the tumor suppressor genes, which ultimately prevents controlled cell growth and cancer progression and loss of imprinting of the genes such as Igf2/H19 cluster. Decitabine is used to treat myelodplastis syndrome which progresses into acute myleiod leukemia. Decitabine can also be used along HDAC inhibitors and standard chemotherapeutic methods to get best possible cancer treatment. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation have enduring effects on the epigenome because it is very stable epigenetic mark which is passed on the daughter cells, thus it is mitotically heritable. Sensitive periods are those periods during development  where previous epigenetic marks are erased such as and new epigenetic  are made such as methylation of parental allele specific  imprinting of genes, methylation of whole genome and germ cell specific methylation. Once these methylation pattern are established in somatic cells, they are maintained throughout the life and methylation pattern in primordal germ cells is maintained and passed to the next generation. There are two such sensitive periods in mammalian development,  during primordial germ cell development (where methylation of paternal, maternal and imprinted genes are erase and reestablished) and blastula stage in early embryonic development(where methylation of only paternal and maternal but not imprinted genes are erases and reestablished). Prevention of DNMT and DNA demethylase during these sensitive periods will alter the methylation marks of the whole embryo as well as its germ cells. Thus, it will affect tissues of all over body and also next generation, since DNA methylation plays many other important role in gene expression, genomic stability, development other than just cancer.</div>
