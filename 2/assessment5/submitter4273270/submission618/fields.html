    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">One of the function of DNA Methylation is to maintain genomic stability. DNA methylation at CpG island is associated with silencing of gene expression which means that it is an inactive epigenetic mark.<br />CpG islands are commonly found near the promotor of tumor suppressor genes. Hypermethylation of CpG island leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes which in turn leads to cancer.<br />DNA Methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements maintains the genomic stability and protects the genome from transposable elements.<br />In cancer, there is hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements which causes insertions, deletions or translocation of genes leading to genomic instability.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation of ICR (imprint control region) on paternal allele does not allow the ctcf insulator protein to bind. Due to this the enhancers act on Igf2 and induces expression on paternal allele.<br />The maternal allele has unmethylated ICR and this allows CTCF to bind to ICR. This insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Now the enhancers acts on H19 and induces expression.<br />In Wilm's tumor, there is loss of imprinting and both alleles behave like paternal allele. This results in over expression of Igf2 which is a growth promotor and this in turn leads to cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (DNA methyl transferase inhibitor) is a chemical analogue of cytosine which incorporates into DNA during replication. This incorporation inhibits DNA methytransferases, an enzyme that is responsible for methylating newly synthesized DNA in mammalian cells, thus reactivating epigenitically silenced tumor suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation could lead to genomic instability in the form of point mutations, translocation, amplifications or deletions.<br />Sensitive period is defined as the period when most of epigenetic reprogramming occurs.During this period there is removal as well as laying down of epigenetic marks.<br />There are two such periods; one during primordial germ cell development and other is early embryonic development.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods disrupts epigenetic reprogramming which in turn leads to genomic instability.<br /><br /></div>
