    <div class="field-value">Normally, DNA methylation does not take place at CPG Islands, but rather on repetitive elements, and intergenic regions (for example). In cancer, there is a reverse...methylation occurs at the CPG islands and the other areas are demethylated. One of the ways in which CPG methylation contributes to cancer is that it inactivates tumor suppressors. Over time, as there is increased CPG Methylation, there are more tumor suppressors inactivated. An interesting point is that as we age, there is an increased amount of CPG methylation, which leads to the idea that maybe some cancers are a result of aging. When intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, they can become transcriptionally active.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a de-methylating agent. The drug demethylates CPG islands and can therefore stop tumor growth by changing gene expression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes in methylation at ICRs can lead to loss of expression of growth regulating genes and over expression of growth promoting genes. For example, IGF2 is expressed in the paternal allele because H19 is methylated. However, in the maternal allele, H19 is not methylated because of CTCF binds the ICR and therefore allows the enhancers to express IGF2. In the case of H19/Igf2 in Wilm's tumor, CTCF does not bind to the maternal allele and therefore the maternal and paternal allele express IGF2. There will then be a double dose of IGF2 which is growth promoting, and can cause tumor growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the genome because it is mitotically heritable and therefore when cells divide, the "corrected" DNA methylation pattern will be reproduced. A sensitive period of development would be where changes in methylation could prevent normal growth of cells in to various organs prenatally. Treating patients during this time period could cause irreversible changes since the methylation or demethylation would not return.</div>
