    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells most of the
time CpG Island (found in promoters of gene) have low methylation levels. Lack
of methylation allows transcription factors to bind to the promoter and
promote gene expression. When CpG Islands are highly methylated the genes are
then silenced.</p>

<p>In Cancer cells the level of
methylation is increased at some CpG island of specific genes. In general these
high-methylated CpG Island are found in the promoter of genes able to control
abnormal cell development, promote cells death or control growth.</p>

<p>Increased methylation is
responsible for the silencing of these tumour suppressor genes that are usually
preventing cell abnormal proliferation. Once one of these genes is silenced
abnormal cells can multiply more rapidly taking over other nearby cell. As each
cancer is due to alteration of distinct tumour suppressor gene each cancer is
different.</p>

<p>In normal cells CpG sites
situated at intergenic region and repetitive element are methylated. Methylation
on repetitive elements prevents them from damaging other area of the genome, keeping these regions in a condensed heterochromatic state.</p>

<p>In general, in cancer, the genome
tends to be hypomethylated. This is due to lower methylation at intergenic
region and repeat elements that from together an important part of the genome.
These CpG sites, tend to be less methylated in cancer.</p>

<p><span>Lack of methylation and
histone compaction render this region accessible in euchromatin state. Through alignment
of these regions with similar sequence in other part of the genome abnormal
recombination can occur in cancer cells causing genome instability. Genome
instability is due to unwanted recombination of parts of the genome for example
by loss or gain of chromosome parts or reciprocal translocations. Repeat
element can also become active. Activated repeat can disturb genes when inserting
copy of themselves in functional genes or activating abnormally nearby genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Imprinting control
region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster of the paternal allele is usually
methylated. The downstream enhancer will therefore be able to bind to Igf2
promoting the gene transcription into the Igf2 protein. H19 situated closely to
the ICR is also methylated cause methylation is spreading to the promoter of
H19 and therefore H19 is silenced.</p>

<p>The maternal allele is
usually unmethylated on its ICR. Therefore a protein called CTCF is able to
bind to the ICR site preventing enhancer from binding to the Igf2 gene. Instead
the enhancer will bind to the H19 gene promoting its transcription. H19 then
repress Igf2 transcription. And no Igf2 protein is produced from this particular
maternal allele.</p>

<p>In Wilm’s tumour the two
allele behave like the paternal allele of normal cells, as both of them are
methylated at the ICR and nearby start of the H19 gene. H19 is silenced and
Igf2 transcription is enhanced. In consequence there is twice the dose of the Igf2
protein produced. Igf2 is responsible for promoting growth. In Wilm’s tumour
abnormal growth of the Kidney in affected in child patient.</p>

<p><span>In cancer loss of imprinting
is common, imprinted genes are often involved in growth control.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is part of a group
of DNA demethylating drug. The demethylating drug, as the Decitabine molecule
are able to Inhibit directly or indirectly methyltransferase consequently
leading to decresed methylation of CpG sites of the whole epigenome after cell
division; Because DNA methyltransferase enzyme that are responsible for coping
the methylation to the new formed strand of DNA are inhibited.</p>

<p>In tumour cells,
proliferation is due to abnormal silencing of tumour suppressor genes through
high methylation of promotor CpG island. Some cancer type tumour proliferations
are more dependent on those gene silencing then other mutation or genome
abnormality to be able to grow. Therefore the effect of global demethylation reactivating
those tumour suppressor genes might be imparing tumour development or promoting
cellular death of cancer cells.</p>

<p><span>Nevertheless DNA
demethylating will affect the entire epigenome and not only targeted genes increasing
the genome wide hypomethylation with its associated negative effects.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation will
have enduring effect, as methylation changes will be heritable and maintained
trough cell division. Even when drug treatment will be over modification made
on the whole epigenome will be maintained. </p>

<p>Chemotherapy consists in
killing abnormal cell whereas epigenetic drugs could stop cell proliferation
through reactivation of existing tumour suppression genes and reactivation of natural
cellular death pathways.</p>

<p>Epigenetic drug can alter
methylation of the whole epigenome therefore it would be unadvisable to treat younger
patient with those drugs as the negative consequences on the rest of the genome
might be more detrimental than the positive outcome of the drug for cancer
treatment.</p>

<p>A sensitive period is a
period when the epigenome is more sensitive to environemental influence and is
more likely to be affected in a long lasting way. For example periods of genome
reprograming in embryonic development and gametogenesis are more sensitive periods, where disruption of the epigenome would probably have some detrimental effect
on all descendant cell line of drug-affected cells.</p>

<p><span>Also, if patient are in period of
gamete maturation and reproduce in the years after treatments they could pass their
drug acquired epigenome disruption through the next generation.</span></p></div>
