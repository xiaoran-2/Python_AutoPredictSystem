    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence genes, a way to regulate gene expression. DNA methylation of CpG islands in cancer is increased in a disruptive way. This disruption may inactivate tumor suppressor genes such that their loss of function contributes to progression of cancer. The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements tends to decrease recombination events which contributes to genomic stability. DNA methylation of in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer is decreased in a disruptive 
way. This disruption removes the normal inhibition of recombination events which contributes to genomic instability. In sum, the hypermethylation of CpG islands seen in cancer may silence genes that normally have a protective role against cancer, while hypomethylation elsewhere in the genome in intergenic regions and repeat elements that is seen in cancer may lead to genomic instability.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Binding of CTCF protein to DNA in the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster serves to insulate downstream enhancers from the upstream Igf2 gene. When the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated, binding of the CTCF protein to DNA at that site is blocked. The methylation prevents binding of the insulator, which allows the enhancers to operate freely, which allows the enhancers to increase expression of the IGF2 gene. The maternal allele is normally hypomethylated at the CTCF binding site allowing its binding to silence the Igf2 gene, whereas the paternal allele is normally hypermethylated as the site thus blocking CTCF binding and enhancing Igf2 expression. In Wilms tumor, there is hypermethylation of the ICR in the cluster. This is loss of imprinting, and both alleles look like a paternal allele. In this situation, both alleles are active rather than the normal one (paternal) allele, causing the growth factor Igf2 to signal for excess growth and proliferation, which is the cancerous state.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a member of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor class of epigenetic inhibitors. Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that is incorporated into DNA. When DNA methyltranferases act on the DNA containing the Decitabine molecules during replication, the DNA methyltranferases are irreversibly bound, preventing them from going on to transfer methyl groups at other sites in the DNA. The anti-tumour effect arises because the inhibition is dependent upon replication; the effect of disrupting methylation of DNA is much greater on rapidly dividing tumor cells than on much less rapidly dividing normal cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenomic marks are generally stable over the lifetime of an individual. Once changed by drug therapy, the changed marks would then become the stable marks that persist, and this would remain the case long after the drug has been cleared from the body. A sensitive period would be when the epigenome was undergoing normal change, such as during gamete generation, or when substantial tissue-specific establishment of marks was taking place. It could be harmful for drug treatment to interfere with the normal establishment of epigenetic marks. Sensitive periods of development include during imprinting of the gametes, during reprogramming of the gametic epigenome immediately after fertilization, during fetal development when organs and tissues are taking on their specific epigenetic marks, and to an extent even through childhood when epigenetic changes are still taking place in response to the child's environment. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because epigenetic modifications are crucial to proper gene regulation, and interfering with the proper setting of these modifications during sensitive periods would lead to improper gene regulation and all too likely lead to disease.<br /></div>
