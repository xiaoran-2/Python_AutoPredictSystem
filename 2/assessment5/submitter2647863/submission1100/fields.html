    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">A high CpG density with free of methylation in normal cells, however, in cancer cells, CpG islands in the promoter region tend to become hypermethylated to cause silence of the underlying gene. Changes in DNA methylation will lead to genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes  as well as silencing of tumor suppressor genes that control cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair. On the contrast, DNA methylation in intragenic regions and repetitive elements was highly methylated in normal cells, but in cancer cells, these regions are hypomethylated, thus contributes to cancer by genomic instability and oncogene activation, </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>1. In normal cells, Imprint control region (ICRs) is methylated on the paternal allele, and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it's unmethylated CTCF binds its insulator element, and it means that the enhancers act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so no IGF2 expression. On the paternal allele, because this is methylated, so the enhancers will act on IGF2, because CTCF is not binding to inhibit H19, and IGF2 is <span>expressed from the pattern allele. <br /></span><span><br />2. In Wilm's tumor, however, with loss of imprinting and</span> have hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the </div><div>maternal allele as well. This also induces expression of Igf2 o<span>n the maternal allele. A</span> double dose of Igf2 expression in a tumor cell in <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">comparison to a normal </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">cell. Therefore, </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Igf2 is both growth promoting and</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> associated with Wilm's tumour. </span></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent that hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase and used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. <br /><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">2. Decitabine's anti-tumor effects are believed to be twofold. One way that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
