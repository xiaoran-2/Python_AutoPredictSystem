    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are pairs of nucleotides "cytosine plus guanine" in DNA sequence. Because C is complementary to G, every CpG has CpG on the complementary strand in other direction. Cytosine in CpG is methylated at carbon 5 to produce 5-methyl-cytosine. CpG methylation leads to gene silencing by creating more closed chromatin structure and preventing the binding of some transcription factors. CpG methylation is not very common and most CpG in normal cells are not methylated.<br /><br />In cancer CpGs are often hypermethylated.<br /><br />That leads to silencing of some genes, and if methylation happens in promoters of tumor suppressor genes, that results in cancer growth and/or formation. Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, when a cancer cell divides the two daughter cells will have the same methylation pattern of hypermethylated CpGs and silenced tumor suppressor genes. Cancer cells undergo selection and the cells that grow the fastest and/o are most resistant to therapy (because of their CpG methylation pattern among other things) survive and produce the most aggressive tumors.<br /><br />Generally the whole genome (with exception of CpG islands) in cancer cells is hypomethylated compared to the normal cells. Most critical parts are repetitive sequences and intergenic regions.<br /><br />Normally repetitive sequences are highly methylated, which prevents their transcription and contributes to genetic stability. Decreased methylation leads to activation of transposable elements and to abnormal recombinations between other repetitive sequences, which creates chromosomal abnomralities, such as insertions and deletions of large pieces of DNA and reciprocal translocations . Also in the intergenic sequences sometimes are located "cryptic promoters" normally kept inactive by methylation. When they are hypomethylated they may activate and cause expression of nearby genes. If the gene is cell cycle control gene that can lead to cancerous transformation of a cell. Similar result can happen as a consequence of insertion/deletion/translocation. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 is an imprinted gene that normally expresses Igf2 only from paternal allele. Paternal allele has H19 methylatec which causes nearby enhancer elements to exhert their influence on Igf2 gene causing its transcription. Igf2 (insluin-like growth factor 2) leads to growth.<br /><br />Maternal H19 is unmethylated, which leaves the nearby binding site for CTCF unmethylated as well CTCF insulator protein binds and insulates enhancers from Igf2, turning off its expression.<br /><br />When maternal allele has wrong methylation pattern (more methylated) it behaves like paternal allele that causes the cell to make too much Igf2. IgThat leads to Beckwith-Weidemann syndrome that is characterized by general tissue overgrowth, including the formation of some rare tumors (such as Wilm's tumor of the kidney).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decytabine is a nucleotide analog (cytosine with C atom replaced by N). It acts as an inhibitor for DNA-methylatransferase. It is an enzyme inihbitor - like many other successful drugs. But it modifies activity of an enzyme that act directly on DNA, thus causing change in DNA epigentic marks. As a result it can be classified in a class of demethylating agents - it causes DNA to be less methylated.<br /><br />Methylation in cancer cells is abnormal, including hypermethylation of some regions such as CpG islands. Hypermetylation in some gene promoters may lead to silencing of these genes, for example genes that normally prevent cancer, such as tumor-suppressor type genes, or DNA repair genes that prevent/decrease number of mutations. By decreasing (abnormal) methylation decytabine may lead to reactivation of these important genes and slowing down cancer growth or even elimination of cells' cancer phenotype entirely, without actually killing the cells.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is often mitotically heritable because cells have certain enzymes including "maintentnace metyltrasferase" DNMT1 that detects methylation on one strand of DNA and methylate the newly-made strand. <br />During organism development some periods are more sensitive to DNA epigenome alterations. During those periods the cells rearrange their epigenetic marks. That include preimplantation period, when most epigenetic marks are erased and then re-created. Another sensitive period includes the time when even larger selection of epigenetic marks is erased and re-created during primordial gamete cell formation. Interference during the first period can disrupt organism's individual development, whil interference during the second can lead to abnormal gametes with results seen only in the next generation (or infertility if gametes are inviable).<br />Using epigenetics-altering drugs that affect all cells is dangerous even in adult organism, since many of our cells rely on correct epigenetic "profile" including hypermethylation of repets, sex-dependent imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation. If drugs disrupt these set conditions it can lead to cell malfunction or death. Especially dangerous are the period of early embryonic development (therefore these drus are unadvisable for pregnant women who desire to maintain their pregnancy) and for young people since they can disrupt epigenome in the gametes.</div>
