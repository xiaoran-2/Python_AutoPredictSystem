    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are regions in the genome where you find more of CpG dinucleotides than you would expect by chance, and are tend to be found at the promoters of genes. CpG islands are normally protected from methylation, so methylation actually doesn't tend to occur at CpG islands (there are exceptions, for example in X inactivation). When a CpG island is methylated, this usually leads to silencing of gene expression.<br />In cancer, methylation of CpG islands is increased. This leads to a decreased expression of tumor suppressor genes (so leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes). Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, this silent state of this gene will be "locked". This will lead to progression of the cancer.<br /><br />Usually the DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is methylated. The function of this is thought to be the maintenance of genomic integrity by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites, but also the silencing of repeats. Silencing of these repetitive elements avoids transcriptional interference from strong promoters prevents transposition and illegitimate recombination (translocations/deletions/insertions). <br />In cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to show less methylation then in normal cells. The outcome of this hypomethylation is dependent on the location, but in general it leads to genomic instability, which leads to progression of cancer. <br />When hypomethylation happens in repeats this can lead to illegitimate recombinations between repeats. This is because the regions that are genetically similar are now no longer methylated and tightly packed in heterochromatin, but are now more open and recombination can happen because of alignment between the repeats. Additionally, hypomethylation of repeats can lead to their activation, and their consequent transposition. When hypomethylation happens in CpG poor promoters, this can lead to the activation of oncogenes. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele, the imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated, which means CTCF cannot bind to insulate the imprint control regions. This way, the enhancers can act on Igf2, leading to expression of the gene. H19 will be silenced. <br />Maternal allele: the imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster is not methylated, so CTCF will bind. CTCF insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers, and therefore in this case these enhancers are free to  act on H19, and enhance the expression of H19. Igf2 will be silenced.<br />In Wilm's tumor there is loss of imprinting: in this case there is hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. So now you have expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele as well as on the paternal allele. Since Igf2 is growth-promoting (oncogene), this leads to progression of the cancer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine  is a DNMT inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analog, which get incorporated into the DNA when it is being replicated. When DNMT1 binds to that nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, DNMT1 is bound irreversibly and can no longer be released. This means the increased DNA methylation status of the tumor DNA cannot be transferred to the daughter cells and their daughter cells etc. Additionally, the action of Decitabine is division-dependent, and since tumor cells divide much more rapidly than normal cells, they will be more severely affected because they are replicating more. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenenome because it is mitotically heritable, meaning that the methylation status is passed on during cell division to the daughter cells, until it is entirely erased. This means you don't have to treat someone with the epigenetic drugs forever, but only for a relatively short amount of time. <br /><br />A sensitive period are the periods when the epigenetic marks in the DNA 
have to be adequately copied or removed from the DNA. For example, in 
these periods DNA methylation of the paternal/maternal genome has to be 
removed, while the DNA methylation of imprinted genes and repeats has to
 stay intact.  Sensitive periods of development include early embryonic development, and the development of the primordial germ cells and gametes.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable, because in these periods the normal cells, which you don't want to target, will be targeted as well. You will not only target the tumor cells, but also to the normal cells, which you actually do not want to target at all. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
