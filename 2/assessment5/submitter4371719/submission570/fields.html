    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands are usually hypomethylated, that is, very little methylation, whereas (again in normal cells) the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated.  The methylation of the intergenic and repetitive elements keeps the cell from trying to express those portions of the genome.  In a cancer cell, often the reverse is seen.  CpG islands in cancer cells are often hypermethylated and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements have low or hypomethylation. In cancer cells, the CpG islands that are often methylated are the genes for tumor suppression, such as RB, MLH1, BRCA1, and MGMT. If the tumor suppression gene is not expressed the cell is more likely to become a tumor cell.  This is especially true if there is a mutation in one of the tumor suppressor genes, as well.  Hypermethylation of the non-mutated suppressor gene would mean there are no copies of the suppressor gene and it is much more likely for a cell to become a cancer cell.<br />As mentioned, in a normal cell intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated to insure genomic stability, to keep transposable regions from transposing and reduce expression of abnormal areas.<br />In cancer cells, hypomethylation in intergenic and repeat area very commonly found, but more so in the repeat areas.<br />The lack of methylation in the repeat areas can cause illegitimate recombination between chromosomes. Also, repeats can transpose, that is, jump around in the genome and perhaps disrupt a normal gene.  Intergenic region hypomethylation can cause activation of cryptic promotors, disruption of neighboring genes and can lead to activation of some genes or express microRNA, which with miR21, for example can disrupt the PTEN tumor suppressor.<br />In general, the hypomethylation of intergenic and repetive elements can lead to deletions and insertions, and general genomic instability.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/lgf2 cluster he loss of imprinting is caused by hypermethylation of Imprint Control Regions and cancer cells show loss of imprinting.<br />Normally, in the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated allowing CTCF to bind to it, insulating the igf2 from the enhancers and thus allowing the enhancers to work on the H19 gene and not on Igf2, which remains unexpressed in the maternal allele.<br />Normally, in the paternal allele the ICR is methylated (and methylation spreads to H19) and thus the enhancers cause the igf2 on the paternal allele to be expressed, as the enhancers prefer igf2 over H19.<br />The imprinting in Wilm's tumor is disrupted when the maternal allele is also methylated.  This methylation causes the enhancers to see the igf2 (because CTCF can't bind and won't insulate), enhance it, and the igf2 is expressed in the maternal as well as the paternal allele and the cell will have twice as much as it normally needs.  igf2 is a growth promoter and growth is one of the factors needed for tumor development and leads to the Wilm's tumor.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethlyating agent (a hypomethylating agent) and belongs to the DNMTi (DNA methyl transferase inhibitor) class of epigenetic inhibitors.<br />Decitabine is a nucleoside analog (for cytidine) and is incorporated into the DNA upon duplication. When DNMT attaches to the DNA where this analog exists it becomes irreversibly bound and therefore cannot continue further with methylation of the DNA.  Therefore the Decitabine has the affect of reducing methylation of DNA in dividing cells (cells that are making copies of their DNA).  A possible mechanism for its anti-tumor effect is with its affect on CpG islands.  CpG islands in cancer cells are often hypermethylated and may inhibit expression of tumor suppression genes.  By reducing the methylation of these islands the tumor suppression may become active again.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation (or demethylation) can remain through mitosis.  Any changes in the methylation can be inherited by all daughter cells, even after drug treatment ends.  A drug treatment may affect an enzyme that methylates the DNA, for instance and may inhibit the action of the enzyme causing the demethylation of some of the DNA, such as in CpG islands. Once a methylation state is created and the DNA is replicated and the cell divides, that pattern of methylation is carried by the daughter cells, and through future cell divisions.  Thus, the affects will continue long after the drug treatment has ceased; all cells after the original treatment will continue to carry the epigenetic pattern created during the treatment period.  Because of the long term affects it is important to recognize sensitive periods, when epigenetic marks are being established in tissues, cell differentiation (such as with an embryo)  and when germ cells are being produced in embryos and fertile males and in the young while tissues (such as brain) are developing. Any treatment during sensitive periods could have devastating affects.  For instance, changing the epigenetic marks of differentiating tissue of an embryo might lead to embryo death or severly dysfunctional organs.<br /><br /><br /></div>
