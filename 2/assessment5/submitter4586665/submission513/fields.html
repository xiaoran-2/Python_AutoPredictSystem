    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation usually acts as a
silencing mark, since it leads to a more condensed chromatin. This modification
can occur at CpG islands, which can be found at gene promoters.  In a normal cell, these islands tend to remain
unmethylated, thus allowing gene expression. </span></p>



<p>In cancer, these CpG islands are
more likely to be hypermethylated, and are usually in the promoters of tumor suppressor
genes (involved in cell cycle regulation, differentiation, DNA repair,
apoptosis, etc.), silencing them and leading to an uncontrolled cellular
replication. Hypermethylation of CpG islands can be initiated by chance, if the
methylation machinery is mutated and randomly starts to put these marks in the
DNA. On the other hand, some oncogenes can direct de novo methylation of the
DNA. Since this modification gives the cell a selective advantage over the others,
this epimutation is maintained and can progress. </p>



<p>DNA methylation can also occur at
intergenic regions and repetitive elements in the genome. These regions are
usually methylated and highly condensed, maintaining genomic integrity and preventing
deletions, insertions and translocations of DNA fragments and transposition of
repetitive elements. Methylation at these regions can also repress
transcription at cryptic start or splice sites, avoiding antisense
transcriptional activity and transcriptional interference. </p>



<p>In a cancer cell, there’s a general
hypomethylated state, affecting intergenic regions and repetitive elements,
thus leading to genomic instability and resulting in disruptions of important
genes controlling cell proliferation, duplication and/or loss of genes or whole
chromosomes, overexpression of oncogenes, etc. Hypomethylation usually occurs
when epigenetic enzymes are mutated and the DNA methylation cannot be
maintained through cell division. It can also occur by chance, when this
machinery makes mistakes and these marks are lost.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster has a paternally imprinted
control region. The methylation of the paternal allele prevents the CTCF
protein, which is an insulator, from binding the DNA, so the downstream enhancers can promote
the expression of the Igf2 gene and the CpG island of the H19 promoter, which
codifies for a lncRNA, becomes methylated and H19 isn't expressed. In the unmethylated maternal allele, the CTCF
protein can bind the DNA and avoids that the enhancers reach the Igf2 promoter.
The enhancers stimulate H19 expression instead, and Igf2 remains silent for
this allele. </p>

<p>Wilm’s tumour is a kidney tumour that usually
arises in children and can be caused by the loss of imprinting in this H19/Igf2
cluster. The imprinting can be disrupted when there’s a mutation or a deletion
of the imprinted region, when two paternal alleles are inherited or when the
imprinting is epigenetically disrupted. This way, the maternal allele becomes
methylated, so the CTCF protein cannot bind the DNA and results in the
enhancement of Igf2 expression and the loss of expression of H19. This leads to
an overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth factor, and no H19 expression, which
limits cell growth, and ultimately a tumour arises.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a drug used as an epigenetic
inhibitor because it’s a DNA demethylating agent. This drug, which is a
chemical analog of cytidine, is incorporated into the DNA during replication.  When the DNA methyltransferase arrives to this
region to copy the methylation in the new DNA strand, decitabine irreversibly
binds this enzyme and it cannot be released. This way, decitabine causes DNA hypomethylation
and can be used as an anti-neoplastic agent since its action is
replication-dependent. This means that those cells with a greater replication
rate, that is, tumour cells, will be more affected by this drug than normal
cells.</span><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is maintained
through mitosis and these marks can even remain in future cell generations. This
is possible because of the activity of methyltranferases which recognize hemi-methylated
DNA and can mark the new strand with a methyl group in the correct position.
Thanks to this mechanism, treatment with drugs affecting DNA methylation can
manipulate the DNA once and the effects will be preserved during mitosis,
restoring the normal function of this DNA region and avoiding a chronic
treatment. </p>

<p>However, these drugs should not be
used during sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming. A sensitive period
is a timeframe when cells are more susceptible to inputs of the environment,
which can have a big influence on the epigenome. The main sensitive periods of
development are those where epigenetic reprogramming occurs: during the development
of primordial germ cells and the maturation of eggs and sperms, and during
pre-implantation and early post-implantation of the embryo. Every cell can be
potentially affected by epigenetic drugs, so treating patients during these sensitive
periods can modify normal reprogramming, thus interfering with the imprinting
of important genes that can lead to serious heritable diseases. <br /></p></div>
