    <div class="field-value"><b>HOW DNA METHYLATION IS ALTERED IN CANCER:</b><br /><br />In cancer, the global level of DNA methylation decreases (<strong>genome-wide hypomethylation</strong>) as a tissue progresses from its normal state to an invasive phenotype; however in some CpG islands, methylation density actually increases (<strong>tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation</strong>). <br /><br />A normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is <b>genomic imprinting</b>, an epigenetic phenomenon by which certain genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner.<br /><br /><b>CpG island (CGI) hypermethylation at specific loci silences tumor suppressor genes</b>, originating a cancer phenotype. CGI methylation progresses with time.<br /><br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is securing <b>genomic stability</b>. <br /><br />Hypomethylation of repeats/intergenic invervals causes <b>genomic instability</b>, causing cancer by the following mechanisms:<br />- illegitimate recombination between repeats<br />- activation of repeats and transposition<br />- Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes (c.f. Avy and Axinfu alleles)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>HOW DISRUPTION OF IMPRINTING CAN CONTRIBUTE TO CANCER</b>: the H19/Igf2 cluster example<br /><br />Regarding the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the <b>paternal allele</b>. Therefore, CTCF won't bind its insulator. As a consequence, the enhancers can act on Igf2, <b>expressing</b> a gene that is involved  in growth (it is growth-promoting). <br /><br />In the <b>maternal allele</b>, absence of methylation at the ICR allows CTCF binding of its insulator. As a consequence, Igf2 won't act on the Igf2 (<b>Igf2 gene </b><b>won't be expressed</b>).<br /><br />In <strong>Wilm's tumor</strong>, patients exhibit a<strong> loss of imprinting</strong>: the maternal allele for the H19/Igf2 cluster is hypermethylated at the ICR, preventing CTCF binding to its insulator. Consequently, the enhancers act on Igf2 promoting its expression. The person will have a <strong>double dose of Igf2</strong>. Igf2 is growth-promoting, and it's associated to Wilm's tumor.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>DECITABINE</strong><br /><br />Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (<b>DNMT inhibitor</b>). It's also considered a <b>Hypomethylating Agent</b> [1], a <b>Demethylating Agent</b> [2], and a <b>Cytotoxic agent</b> (<b>Cytidine analog)</b> [3].<br /><br />Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue (2′-deoxy-5-azacytidine) that irreversibly binds DNMTs after it is incorporated into DNA. Decitabine is therefore replication dependent.<br /><br />Anti-tumor effect: by covalently binding to DNMTs through their N-5 position, decitabine depletes intracellular enzyme and leads to global <b>demethylation of DNA</b> and <b>tumor cell differentiation and apoptosis</b>.<br /><br />Due to the formation of intracellular nucleotides, which become incorporated into DNA, the effects of the aza-nucleosides persist for many hours.<br /><br /><a href="http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/drugs.aspx?globalId=5688"></a>References:<br />[1] The MD Anderson Manual of Medical Oncology, 2e<br />© 2011 by The McGraw-Hill Companies,    Inc.<br /><br />[2] Williams Hematology, 8e<br />© 2010 by The McGraw-Hill Companies,    Inc.<br /><br />[3] Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 12e &gt; <br />© 2011 by The McGraw-Hill Companies,    Inc.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>Drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment</b><br /><br />Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because the particular <b>epigenetic pattern</b> that a cell type has is <b>transmissible through mitosis</b>. That's why epithelial cell precursors give rise to other epithelial cells throughout our life.<br /><br />In epigenetics, a <b>sensitive period</b> is a time interval of increased sensitivity to the effect of environmental signals on the structure and function of the genome.<br /><br />There are <strong>two sensitive periods of development</strong>: <br />- blastocyst stage, and <br />- Epigenetic reprogramming during gametogenesis. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) undergo demethylation at imprinted loci, which erases parental imprinting marks.<br /><br />It would be inadvisible treating patients during sensitive periods because normal <strong>gametogenesis </strong>could be disrupted, creating spermatocytes or oocytes with unpredictable mutations.<br /><br /><br /></div>
