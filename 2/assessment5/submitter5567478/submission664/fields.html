    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is altered in cancer by the following; in the normal cell CpG regions are hypomethylated, as these regions are at the promoters of tumor supressor genes, required  to control oncogenes activation. In cancer, CpG islands are dysrupted by hypermethylation of these regions. Hypermethylation of these CpG regions prevents activation of tumor supressor genes, hence enabling tumor to thrive. In a normal functioning cell, DNA mythylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells are hypomethylated. hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive regions results in illegitimate recombinations between repeats, which leads to genomic instability hence cancer promotion.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, the ICR is hypermethylated, this prevents CTCF from binding to this region preventing H19 expression, hence the enhancers bind to the Igf2 promoter region resulting in the expression of Igf2. In the maternal allele, the ICF region is hypomethylated, and this allow the binding of CTCF and the expression of H19 and silencing of Igf2. In Wilm's tumor, both the paternal and maternal ICR are hypermethylated, this results in the binding of the enhancers to the Igf2 regions on both alleles which results in over-expression of Igf2. In cancer, hypermethylation at the ICR on both alleles leads to over-expression of Igf2 which promotes tumor growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors called <span>DNA-demethylating agents.<br />Decitabine reduces DNA methylation, hence producing a hypomethylation state in the target cell.<br /><br />Decitabine could have antitumour effect by two possible mechanisms; hypomethylating CpG regions leading to their expression which promote tumour suppressor genes expression, and hypomethylation of ICR which will enhance H19 expression which does not enhance tumour growth and suppressing Igf2 expression which promotes tumour growth <br /><br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is important for normal functioning of cells, altering DNA methylation could lead to the expression of detrimental genes which otherwise would have been silenced. As an example, preventing methylation could prevent silencing of x-chromosome which would be detrimental.<br />Sensitive period is the stage in development where alteration in the methylation of the cell could be deterimental to the organism.<br />Sensitive periods of development are the Early development (Blastocyst stage) and the primordial germ cell development stage<br />Treating patients in sensitive patients could lead to epigenetic abnormalities, including fertility problems.</div>
