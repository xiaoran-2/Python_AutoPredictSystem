    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Normally<b> CpG islands </b>are mostly<b> not methylated</b> (are
hypomethylated).  Methylation of CpG
islands <b>seems to have the function of silencing  the gene</b>.  
Methylated CpGs are also <b>associated
with chromatin condensation</b> caused by binding proteins (MeCP1, MeCP2).  Hence with the normal hypomethylation, the
genes are usually expressed.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>Cancer
changes the normal hypomethylation of CpG islands (generally in the promoters
of <b>tumour suppressor genes</b>) to
hypermethylation, thus <b>inactivating
these genes</b> and allowing the cancer cells to proliferate.  The rapid proliferation  of cancer cells favours selection.  Since DNA methylation is mitotically
heritable the epigenetic silencing is effectively locked in; the extent of
hypermethylation increases with the proliferation of the cancer.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>Intergenic regions and repetitive
regions</b><span> are <b>normally methylated</b>.  The <b>function
of DNA methylation at intergenic regions</b> is to <b>maintain genomic integrity</b> by maintaining genomic stability and
silencing transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites.    </span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>At repetitive elements</b><span>, <b>methylation  maintains genomic
integrity</b> by silencing repeats and mutation of the repeats (meC to Thymine
by deamination); both prevent transposition. 
Silencing repeats also avoids transcription from strong promoters. <b>Illegitimate recombination is prevented</b>
by methylation.   The Bestor genome
defence model suggests that <b>methylation
at repeats protects the genome from transposable elements</b>.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>In
contrast to CpG islands with cancer, repetitive elements and intergenic regions
become hypomethylated with cancer.  This
leads to genomic instability, manifested illegitimate recombination between
repeats, repeats are activated and transposed, cryptic promoters are activated
and neighbouring genes disrupted.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">Normally
the <strong>paternal allele is paternally imprinted</strong>, i.e. it is<strong> methylated at the
imprint control region </strong>(ICR), as is H19 due to heterochromatin or DNA methylation
spreading, <strong>allowing the downstream enhancers to promote Igf2 expression.</strong></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">The<strong>
ICR of the maternal allele on the other hand is unmethylated</strong>, allowing CTCF and
its cofactors to bind its insulator element.<span> 
</span>The enhancers are blocked from acting on Igf2, so <strong>H19 is promoted by the
enhancers.</strong> (Igf2 is silent – not expressed.)</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">Hence,
<strong>Igf2’s expression is normally promoted from the paternal allele and not the maternal
allele.</strong></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><strong>With
loss of imprinting, the ICR on the maternal allele is also methylated</strong>, resulting
in enhancement of the expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele. <span> </span><span> </span>So, both
alleles express Igf2, instead of just the paternal allele (i.e. <strong>overexpression</strong>). <span> </span><span><strong> </strong></span><strong>Igf2 is
growth promoting</strong> (it is an oncogene), and this <strong>growth proliferation contributes
to a childhood cancerous growth starting in the kidney</strong> called Wilms’ tumour. <span> </span>(In accordance with Knudsen, other ‘hits” may be
required.)</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase
inhibitor</strong>.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It
<strong>causes DNA-demethylation</strong>, i.e. hypomethylation of DNA, <strong>during cell
division</strong>. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It gets inserted in the DNA on
replication.  The methyltransferase  that wants to bind the nucleotide (during
replication) is itself bound by the Decitabine and is unable to bind the
nucleotide or transfer the methylation to the daughter strand.  Since<strong> it acts during replication</strong>,
non-dividing cells are relatively insensitive to Decitabine, but <strong>has major
effects on rapidly dividing cancer cells.</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>It is currently used at very low
doses; at high doses it is cytotoxic, causing cell death.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation marks are mitotically
heritable and hence persist, even for the life of the organism.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A <b>sensitive period</b> is a time when the environment may
be able to influence epigenetic makeup.   Exposure e.g to tobacco smoke may be
particularly deleterious to the developing organism, and in fact future generations
in the case of germ cell development.   </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Generally, the time of primordinal germ cell
development to the production of mature egg and sperm (i.e to the young adult stage)
and early embryo development (pre-implantation and early post-implantation) are
regarded as the two most <b>sensitive periods</b> in the mammalian life cycle. Note
that epigenetic reprogramming occurs at these times.  <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>In rats, maternal licking of pups leads to less
stressed adults by setting the appropriate epigenetic marks in the hippocampus.
 Similarly, children in loving families also
usually grow up well adjusted.  <strong>Could this
also be epigenetic?</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Anything that would interfere with the epigenetic machinery
could have (currently) unknown and probably deleterious effects on the organism
and future generations during these two sensitive periods .  So, drugs that target the genome or epigenetics
(e.g. methylation state) should be administered (if at all) with great caution, and in
very much lower doses than normal. </p>
