    <div class="field-value">CpG-islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters, are usually kept free of methylation. However in cancer cells, promoter CpG-islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying genes. CpG-island hyper-methylation is generally found in the promoters of suppressor genes. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and is a very effective way of silencing these tumour suppressor genes. As well, these epi-mutations can be rapidly selected for.<br /><br />In general, the genome is not made up of CpG islands - most of the genome is made up of intergenic intervals or repetitive elements where CpGs are normally methylated. However, in cancer these regions tend to become hypo-methylated. DNA methylation normally functions to maintain genomic stability in this part of the genome. Therefore, genomic instability due to hypo-methylation of such repeats can cause: illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters. The overall outcome is additional deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.   <br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (imprint control regions), either hypo or hyper-methylated, can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and over-expression of growth promoting genes. An example of this is shown in hyper-methylation of ICR in the lgf2/H19 cluster. In a normal cell, this cluster is paternally imprinted - ICF is methylated on the paternal chromosome. This methylation results in silencing of the H19 locus, allowing the enhancers downstream to express the lgf2 gene. lgf2 is associated with growth promoting. Alternatively, the maternal ICF is unmethylated allowing CTCF (an insulator protein) to bind, which results in the enhancers to act on H19 instead and silencing the lgf2 gene.<br />  <br />In Wilm's tumour, both ICRs on the parental chromosomes are methylated resulting in the over-expression of lgf2. The enhancers from both strands will be activating the expression of lgf2 which results in the overall silencing of the H19 gene. Since lgf2 is associated with growth promotion and H19 is associated with growth suppression, the overall effect from the loss of imprinting at the lgf2/H19 locus is growth. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, commonly known as Dacogen, is a DNA-demethylating agent. In other words, it inhibits DNA methyltransferases causing hypo-methylation of DNA. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia. Overactivity of methylates causes silencing of genes, including tumour suppressor genes whose job it is to stop uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. By using Decitabine, the drug can inhibit this silencing and allow normal expression of tumour suppressor genes.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable through cell division. By using drugs such as Decitabine that alter DNA methylation, these changes will be passed down to daughter cells until they are actively removed. There are sensitive periods of development when you would avoid treating patients with such drugs. These are times when changes to the environment (ie. drug treatment) will have the greatest susceptibility to change in DNA. These sensitive periods of development are identified as primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development.<br /><br />It is inadvisable for treating patients during these sensitive periods since this is a time of epigenetic reprogramming. It is during these times that epigenetic marks are being laid down and will be maintained during the life of an individual. By using drugs at this time of development, it could cause disruptions that could create long-term effects.    </div>
