    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>CpG island (CGIs) are found in many promoter and usually are unmethylated function by destabilizing nucleosomes and creating a transcriptionally permission chromatin state.</li><li>In cancer, promoter CGIs are sometimes hypermethylated causing gene silencing. In contrast, the hypomethylation of CpG sites has also been associated with increasing oncogene expression in cancer cells.</li><li>DNA methylation might silence tumor suppressor genes , this epigenetic state is mitotically heritability, followed by epimutation selection to contribute to cancer. DNA hypermethylation can also happened in a set of genes to contribute to CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)</li><li>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genome stability by prevent recombination between repeats and to prevent transposition.</li><li>in cancer, hypomethylation were observed in repeats and intergenetic intervals.<br /></li><li>Hypomethylation in the repeats and intergenic intervals would cause genomic instability by : (1) Illegitimate recombination between repeats which will result in chromosomal deletion, reciprocal translocation or insertions; (2) activation of repeats and transposition; and (3) Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes. <br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Gene expression is regulated by three mechanisms in the <i>H19/Igf2</i> cluster at human chomosome 11: methylation, enhancers activity and insulator activity. In normal cells, the paternal copy of imprinting control region (ICR) and promoter region of H19 are methylated and the endodermal enhancers located downstream of <i>H19</i>  gene will be acted upon <i>Igf2</i> to turn on its transcription. <br /></li><li>In normal cells, the maternal allele of ICR is not methylated and transcriptional repressor CTCF (CCTC-binding factor) will bind to ICR and insulate the endodermal enhancers on the promoter of <i>Igf2</i>. The enahcners can activate <i>H19</i> expression from the maternal allele.<br /></li><li>In Wilm's tumour, hypermethylation of imprinting control region of the maternal allele will resulted in loss of imprinting. Both the maternal and the paternal allele of <i>Igf2</i> will be expressed but the paternal allele of <i>H19</i> will not be expressed.</li><li>Loss of imprinting of the maternal allele of the <i>H19/Igf2</i> cluster is common in cancer and will causing increased cell growth and contributes to childhood kidney tumor.<br /></li></ul><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agents <br /></li><li>Decitabine is taking up by cells and phosphorylated and incorporated into RNA and suppressing RNA synthesis. After Decitabine is converted by ribonucleotide reductases and subsequent phosphorylated into triphosphate form, it is incorporated into DNA to in replace of cytosine. The 5' nitrogen atom is replaying the carbon atom, DNMTs are no longer be able to methyle the newly synthesized DNA strain. Decitabine can significantly increase hemimethylated DNA and after 2nd round of DNA synthesis in the presence of the drugs results in full double stranded DNA demethylation.<br /></li><li>it is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia. The anti-tumor effect is to remove methyl group in the methylated CpG island  or CpG island shores to functional re-expression of aberrantly silenced genes in cancer, causing growth arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells.<br /></li></ul><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The epigenome status (DNA methylation) is mitotically heritable ( can be pass on through cell division), therefor after drug treatment which altering the epigenetics of tumor cells the effects can last beyond the drug treatment.<br /></li><li>Sensitive period including: primordial germ cell (PGC) development and pre-implantation early embryonic development. <br /></li><li>In the sensitive period  epigenome are reprogramming by clearing and resetting of epigentic marks. Paternal genome, maternal genome and imprinted genes are treated differently. Alteration in DNA methylation in the sensitive period may results in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through the gametes, or epigenetic abnormalities. Repetitive elements are slightly demthylated during blastocycts and PGC development If the repetitive elements is demathylated may result in illegitimate recombination and activation of surrounding genes.<br /></li></ul><br /></div>
