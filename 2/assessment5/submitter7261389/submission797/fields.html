    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation's function at CpG animals is mainly used to maintain the integrity of the cell's genome during division or during developmental differentiation. DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark and it is passed on to future cell generations, however it can be altered during gametogenesis, fertilization or artificial cell reprogramming. Also, high rates of DNA replication can induce demethylation due to a passive demethylation. Finally, DNA demethylation has been associated with the presence of different proteins in the cell.<br />DNA methylation is a way of silencing the tumor suppressor genes in cancer and stabilizing the genome, so when DNA is hypomethylated at CpG islands, the cell cycle, apoptosis of DNA repair are not control and that leads to cancer.<br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is also responsible for maintaining genome stability through the silencing of cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. During cancer it has been noted that there is Illegitimate recombination between repeats and  activation of either transpostion or cryptic promoters and the chromosomal instability that is produced leads to cancer. <br /><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the cluster H19/Igf2, the CTCF protein insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers leading to DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding the protein. It has been noted that without the protein the DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoters, silencing it and activating the Igf2. Upregualtion of Igf2 leads to cancer growth. So the maternal allele behaves like the paternal one and the imprinting leads to uniparental disomy and mutation or deletion.<br /><br /><pre></pre><pre><code><code></code></code></pre><br /><br /><div><div><br /></div></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
