    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell a CpG island is hypomethylated. Methylation is not seen normally at CPG islands. But the genome in general is methylated in repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and in the introns of genes.</p>
<p>In contrast, if you look in general at a cancer cell, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. They're not all methylated, but they're more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell. And the rest of the genome in general including the repetitive elements in intergenic elements, and the introns, are hypomethylated.</p>
<p>There is a reciprocal cross swap in terms of where the DNA methylation is found in normal cells and cancer cells. In normal cells, hypomethylated CpG islands, and methylated repetitive elements in intergenic elements as well as the introns. In cancer cells Hypermethylated CpG islands and hypomethylated repetitive elements in intergenic elementsand introns</p>
<p>Methylation at CpG islands found in cancer is called CpG island hypermethylation or CGI hypermethylation. These CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. When a cancer cell is able to inactivate tumor suppressor genes, it can do so genetically, or it can happen epigenetically by silencing the tumor suppressor gene by locking in a silent inactive state, and since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, this means that this is a very good locking down mechanism in terms of epigenetic silencing.</p>
<p><span>CpG island hypermethylation and associated gene silencing occurs really frequently in tumors DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so it's a very effective way of silencing tumor suppressor genes, and these epimutations can be rapidly selected for and allow that particular cell to have a competitive advantage over the others in the surrounding tissues. Over time, the cells that have this epimutation divide more rapidly and do not die as often. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells display loss of imprinting. Genes that should display an allele expression, no longer are an imprint of a parent; rather they either expressed both parental alleles or are silent. Many imprinted genes are involved with growth promoting or growth suppressing and that makes them ideal for cancer. The IGF2 H19 cluster (examined in weeks 4 and 7) is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it's unmethylated CTCF binds its insulator element, and it means that the enhancers in this case will act on H19. Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele but on the paternal allele, because it is methylated, it is enhanced. It is expressed from the pattern allele. With loss of imprinting comes hypermethylation in the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well, so on the maternal allele is expression of Igf2. With this double dose of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell this Igf2 doubles promoting growth and develops with Wilm's tumour, a particular childhood cancer. Loss of imprinting is observed in many tumor types and this loss occurs very early, can be seen in preneoplastic tissues, and are a factor in tumorogenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is in the class of DNA-demethylating agents and is being used to treat myelodysplasia, which manifests malformed and malfunctioning blood cells resulting from pathogenic bone marrow. Decitabine can help by slowing the increase in malformed blood cells by demethylating genetic loci involved with suppression and apoptosis. By slowing abnormal cell malfunction and aiding the repetitive division with normal blood cells, Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome by reversing the cancer hyper and hypo methylation revision and promoting normal cell function. A sensitive period is one during which the epigenome can be challenged by environmental factors in prenatal and early-life development. Treating these patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisiable because the introduction of DNA-methylation altering drugs would profoundly disrupt the epigenetic process at a time when it is just being established.</p></div>
