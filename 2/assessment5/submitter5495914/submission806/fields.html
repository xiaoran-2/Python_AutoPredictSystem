<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is
to change expression of genes (usually results in silencing), imprinting, X inactivation
or making areas of heterochromatin which silences gene expression. CpG islands
are usually at promoters and are unmethylated. In cancer, CpG islands are often
hypermethylated which silences the gene in question. Disrupting the methylation
state at CpG islands can result in the silencing of tumour suppressors. </p>

<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are
often kept highly methylated and the genes or transposons are therefore
silenced. Hypomethylation or changes in the methylation states in these areas
may be seen in cancer cells and this disruption may cause increase or
expression of growth factors. These growth factors can cause uncontrolled cell
division and aneuploidy.  </p>

answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The paternal allele for <i>H19/lgf2</i> in a normal cell is methylated
at the ICR. This prevents the CTCF insulator from binding. The lack of an
insulator allows enhancers to act on the <i>lgf2</i>
gene. This results in expression of <i>lgf2</i>
but not of <i>H19</i> since that area is
hypermethylated.<br />
The maternal allele is not methylated at ICR so the CTCF insulator can bind to
the region and prevent enhancers from acting on <i>lgf2</i>. The enhancers act on the <i>H19</i>
gene. <i>Lgf2</i> is not expressed but <i>H19</i> is. <br />
In Wilm’s tumour, the maternal allele is hypermethylated at the ICR. This
causes the maternal allele to resemble the paternal allele in that the
insulator cannot bind and the enhancers are actings on the <i>lgf2</i> gene. The result is an overexpression of <i>lgf2</i>. Since lgf2 is a growth factor, overexpresion of this protein
contributes to cancer. <br /></span></p><p></p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA-demethylating
agents. Decitabine slows tumour growth and may improve the results from
standard chemotherapy in some cancers and patients. DNA-demethylating agents
remove the methylation on areas that are hypermethylated, allowing for the
genes there to be expressed once again. These genes may be tumour suppressing
genes that were silenced when hypermethylated and therefore contributed to the
development of the tumour. Allowing the expression of these genes again can
have an anti-tumour effect.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring
effects because the changes to DNA methylation are passed on to daughter cells
during mitosis. </p>

<p>A sensitive period is a time during development
when a epigenetic machinery is clearing or laying down new marks (eg. maternal
or paternal imprinting of alleles in germ cells). The sensitive periods occur
in primordial germ cell development and in early development of the embryo. </p>

<p><span>Treating patients during a sensitive period
would be inadvisable as it only takes one cell to result in a tumour  or severe medical condition. Germ cells/early
embryos have these sensitive periods when epigenetic machinery is active and
sensitive to environment effects. In young patients, their germ cells are still
developing. Treatment of young patients may affect the germ cells during a
sensitive period and cause adverse effects in the patient’s potential offspring.
In treating an adult patient there isn’t really any sensitive period of
development, however there may be adverse consequences if the patient doesn’t
know that she is pregnant or if a male fertilizes an egg while on the
treatment. </span></p>
