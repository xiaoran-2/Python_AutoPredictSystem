</strong><p><span><strong>CpG
islands are strongly associated with open and transcriptionally competent
chromatin structure, they play a critical role in gene regulation.</strong><span><strong> </strong><br /></span></span></p><p><strong>In normal cells, the majority of promoter CpG islands
are protected from this epigenetic event and are unmethylated and you don't see methylation in general at CPG islands.</strong></p><strong>

</strong><p><strong>In cancer cells, it has been shown that wide spread DNA
methylation occurs in many promoter CpG islands, resulting in a closed,
repressive chromatin configuration that disables transcription initiation of tumor suppressor genes .</strong></p><strong>

</strong><p><strong>in a normal
cell, what you see is a hypomethylated CPG island, so you don't see methylation
in general at CPG islands. But you find that the genome in general is
methylated in their repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and
indeed even in the introns of genes.

</strong></p><p><strong>In contrast, if
you look in general at a cancer cell, now the CpG islands are more likely to be
methylated. They're not all methylated, but they're more likely to be
methylated than in a normal cell. And the rest of the genome in general, including
the repetitive elements in these intergenic elements, and indeed, the introns,
are hypomethylated</strong></p><p><strong>Hypomethylation
of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements DNA can also cause disruption
of expression of the adjacent gene as well. The L1 mutational insertions have
been found to disrupt the APC gene and the CMYC gene in colon and breast
cancers, respectively.</strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>In somatic
cells, gene body methylation is a major cause of cancer
gene mutations in tumour suppressor genes, such as TP53, which encodes p53.The transcriptional
start sites of many genes encoding tumour suppressors, such as
retinoblastoma-associated protein 1 (RB1), MLH1...lie within CGIs.</strong><strong></strong></p><p><strong>These gene
promoters have been found to be extensively methylated in a large number of
tumours, such as retinoblastoma, colon, lung and ovarian cancers.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>

</strong><p><strong>IGF2
and H19 are two imprinted genes located within the same chromosomal domain. IGF2
is normally transcribed from the paternal (P) allele while H19 is transcribed
from the maternal (M). </strong></p><strong>

</strong><p><strong>Imprinted
expression in both genes is regulated by an imprinting center (IC) in which the
maternal allele is unmethylated and the paternal is unmethylated. 

</strong></p><p><strong>The
imprinting center contains CTCF binding sites to which CTCF binds only if they
are unmethylated. Binding of CTCF blocks the activity of the enhancer element
(E) located downstream of H19 and restricts activity to H19 expression. 

</strong></p><p><strong>Methylation
of the CTCF binding sites prevents the binding of CTCF and allows the enhancer
to activate IGF2. Biallelic expression of the CTCF binding sites in cancer
results in IGF2 overexpression.

</strong></p><p><strong>IC1
and DMR0 are methylated on the paternal chromosome. In BWS, the epigenotype and
expression pattern of the maternal chromosome are converted to paternal and in
SRS, the </strong><strong></strong><strong>epigenotype and expression pattern of the paternal chromosome are
converted to maternal (imprint switching). In the Wilms tumour, IGF2 activation
and H19 silencing are associated with disruption of both maternal and paternal
imprints (somatic loss of imprinting).

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>

</strong><p><span><strong>Decitabine
is a member of a class of drugs known as DNA "demethylating"
agents.  Methylation is a major mechanism
that regulates gene expression in cells. increase in DNA methylation in the
cell can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes"
.  When suppressor genes are blocked, promoting
cancer.</strong></span></p><strong>

</strong><p><span><strong>Decitabine's
anticancer effects are believed to be twofold.  
One way that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the
methylation of DNA.  By this process of
demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus
restoring control over cell growth.</strong></span></p><strong>

</strong><p><span><strong>Decitabine
also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites.  Antimetabolites are very similar to normal
substances within the cell.  When the
cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact
with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect
that causes death of dividing cancer cells.</strong></span></p><strong>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Sensitive
periods include germ cell development and early embryonic development,during
which the organism is more susceptible to epigenetic changes through
environmental influences.</strong></p><strong>

</strong><p><strong>There
are a number of environmental factors which, working alone or in combination, can
alter methylation states during sensitive periods, such as embryogenesis and
early life. These factors include nutrition, toxins, social environment/maternal
care, stochastic events and stress.</strong></p><strong>

</strong><p><strong>Animal
and human studies suggest that the early environment may regulate
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis function by promoting DNA methylation
changes. It is believed that these epigenetic changes are responsible for
altered stress reactivity and could underlie psychopathologies.</strong></p><strong>

</strong><p><strong>Sensitive
periods include germ cell development and early embryonic development.It would
be preferable to avoid treating patients during sensitive periods as epigenetic
marks are being established and inhibiting DNA methylation could have more
pronounced effects on the genome at these times.</strong></p>
