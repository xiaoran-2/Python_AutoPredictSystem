    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Describe_the_normal_function_of_DNA_methylation_at_CpG_islands.</b></p>
<p>
CpG islands are regions of high concentration of CpG
dinculeotides found in gene promoters.  In normal tissues, CpG
islands are largely free of methylation regardless of whether the
gene is expressed or not. This is in contrast to the rest of the
promoter regions outside the CpG islands, which are generally
unmethylated when the gene is expressed and methylated when the gene
is silenced.</p>
<p><b>Describe_how_DNA_methylation_of_CpG_islands_is_disrupted_in_cancer.</b></p>
<p>
In cancerous cells CpG islands are hypermethylated. In
normal tissues CpG islands are generally unmethylated, but become
highly methylated in cancerous tissues.</p>
<p><b>Explain_how_disruption_of_DNA_methylation_at_CpG_islands_contributes_to_cancer.</b></p>
<p>
This hypermethylation causes permanent gene silencing.
The permanently-silenced genes are commonly associated with DNA
repair, cell cycle regulation, tumor suppression, and apoptosis. The
disruption of these critical biological processes lead to cancer.</p>
<p><b>Describe
the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and
repetitive elements.</b></p>
<p>
Methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive
elements in normal tissues protects genomic stability by decreasing
the likelihood of aberrant chromosomal translocations or
recombinations, and  preserving tissue-specific epigenetic
imprinting.</p>
<p><b>Describe
how DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is
disrupted in cancer.</b></p>
<p>
In cancerous tissues intergenic regions and repetitive
elements become hypomethylated, thus losing their tissue-specific
epigenetic marks. This causes the cancerous cell to revert to a state
similar to an undifferentiated embryonic stem cell and it ceases to
function as a normal, differentiated tissue-specific cell.</p>
<p>
<b>Explain how disruption of DNA methylation in
intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to cancer.</b></p>
<p>
With the loss of genomic stability that results from
genome-wide hypomethylation many harmful chromosomal abnormalities
may occur. These include <span>aberrant
chromosomal translocations and recombinations. This disrupts normal
gene expression, protein synthesis, and the biological pathways that
require those proteins.  Commonly this results in cell cycle
dysregulation and uncontrolled cell replication, which is the basis
of tumor formation and cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Describe_the_methylation_pattern_of_the_paternal_allele_and_how_this_determines_Igf2_expression_status.
 </b>
</p><p>
The imprint control region (ICR) for the H19/Igf2
cluster is methylated on the paternal allele. Methylation of the
H19/Igf2 ICR prevents recruitment of the CTCF insulator protein.
Without CTCF, enhancers can access Igf2 and it is paternally-expressed.</p><p><b>Describe_the_methylation_pattern_of_the_maternal_allele_and_how_this_determines_Igf2_expression_status.
 </b>
</p><p>
The ICR for the H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated on the
maternal allele. Lack of maternal methylation of the H19/Igf2 ICR allows recruitment of CTCF. CTCF blocks enhancers from Igf2 and maternal expression of
Igf2 is silenced.</p><p><b>Describe_how_imprinting_at_the_H19/Igf2_cluster_is_disrupted_in_Wilm’s_tumour.</b></p><p>
A maternal mutation/deletion in the ICR reduces recruitment of CTCF.  Thus Igf2 will be
maternally-expressed when it would normally only be paternally-expressed.  Lack of CTCF on the maternal allele decreases expression
of H19, which is normally expressed only on the maternal allele. 
Thus, the gene expression pattern of the maternal allele resembles
the paternal expression pattern and
maternally-expressed genes are under-expressed and
paternally-expressed genes are over-expressed.</p><p>
<b>Explain_how_disrupting_imprinting_at_the_H19/Igf2_cluster_contributes_to_cancer.</b></p><p>
	
	
	









</p><p>
<span>Disrupted imprinting at the H19/Igf2 ICR results in an
inability for the maternal allele to recruit CTCF. Lack of CTCF means
the maternal allele expresses Igf2, but does not express H19. This
abnormal maternal expression pattern is the opposite of the normal expression
pattern, but it_resembles_the_paternal_pattern. Igf2 expression is therefore doubled. Igf2 is a growth-promoting oncogene. Up-regulation_of_Igf2_and_down-regulation_of_its_inhibitor_H19_leads_to_unregulated_growth_and_cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Identify
the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.  </b>
</p>
<p>
Decitabine is a DNA-demethlyating agent.</p>
<p><b>Describe
the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation. </b>
</p>
<p>
Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation enzymes thereby
reducing the amount DNA methylation.</p>
<p>
<b>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour
effect.  </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>In cancerous cells DNA hypermethylation can silence
tumor suppressor genes. By using a DNA-demethlyating agent such as
decitabine the abnormal hyper	methylation of tumor suppressor genes
is reduced thus allowing more expression of tumor suppressor genes
with a resulting anti-tumor effect.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Describe_how_altering_DNA_methylation_can_have_enduring_effects_on_the_epigenome. </b>
</p>
<p>
Epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are preserved
from one generation of cells to the next. Therefore, if a drug can
alter the DNA methylation of a cancerous cell in a way that makes it
more responsive to chemotherapy treatment, that increased sensitivity
to chemotherapy can last long after initial exposure to the
methylation-altering agent because the altered methylation pattern is
passed to future generations of tumor cells.</p>
<p><b>Define_what_is_meant_by_a_sensitive_period. </b>
</p>
<p>
A sensitive period is one in which epigenetic marks are
established throughout the genome.</p>
<p><b>Identify
sensitive periods of development. </b>
</p>
<p>
The period during embryonic stem cell development is a
sensitive period. It is during this phase of early development that
the epigenetic marks that will dictate later tissue-specific cellular
differentiation are established.</p>
<p><b>Explain
why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.</b></p>
<p>
<span>Drugs that alter epigenetic processes (such as those
that inhibit or promote methylation, acetylation, etc.) can disrupt
epigenetic imprinting during early embryonic stem cell development.
This could lead to abnormal cellular development that might have
harmful effects on the developing embryo. Examples of abnormal
cellular development might include aberrant tissue-specific
differentiation or suppression of X-inactivation.  These cellular
processes depend on undisrupted epigenetic programming for normal
functioning.</span></p></div>
