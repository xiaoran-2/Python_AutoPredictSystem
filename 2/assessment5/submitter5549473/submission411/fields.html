    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands, which are often found at gene promoters, are hypomethylated as they tend to be protected from methylation. In cancer these become increasingly hypermethylated as the cancer progresses from hyperplasia to neoplasia and then to invasive state. CpG island methylation varies according to tumour type. This hypermethylation progresses with time and silences growth suppressor genes. This can provide one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis. According to this hypothesis cancer is the result of multiple hits to DNA.<br />In intergenic regions and repetitive elements there is global hypermethylation in normal cells. This helps to maintain genetic integrity. In intergenic regions this methylation silences cryptic transcription start sites as well as cryptic splicing sites. Methylated repetitive elements are silenced to prevent transposition and methylation prevents illegimate recombinations. In cancer these regions become hypomethylated and this is progressive as well as being a common and early finding in tumorigenesis. Hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements increases genomic instability which contributes to cancer developement. This happens as hypomethylation makes repetitive elements active compared to silencing in normal cells and they can be subject to transposition as well as produce illegimate recombinations. There's activation of cryptic promoters and it's possible that nearby genes are disrupted when intergenic regions become hypomethylated. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Paternal allele has hypermethylation of the imprinting control region which is between the H19 and Igf2 gene regions. This hypermethylation blocks binding of CTCF inhibitor protein and this enables the enhancers to affect the Igf2 region which is further from the enhancers than H19. DNA methylation spreads also to the H19 promoters. So Igf2 is expressed in the paternal allele and H19 is silenced.<br />Maternal allele is hypomethylated in the imprinting control region and thus is able to bind CTCF which blocks the enhancers affecting Igf2. In the maternal allele the enhancers affect the closer H19 gene and also the H19 promoters remain hypomethylated, so H19 is expressed.<br />In Wilm's tumour the maternal allele's ICR is hypermethylated and acts like the paternal allele. This leads to overexpression of Igf2. Because Igf2 is growth promoting and H19 is growth restricting, this silencing of H19 and overexpression of Igf2 contributes to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It is a small molecule that is a nucleoside analogue and binds specifically DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs). This binding is irreversible. They are incorporated into DNA during replication. This means that the DNA demethylation effect is dependent on DNA replication. As cancer cells are replicating faster than normal cells this inhibitor affects cancer cells more than normal cells.<br />Decitabine is used in treatment of myelodyplastic syndromes which are precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. They have an anti-tumour effect when there is hypermethylation in cancer cells as they demethylate DNA and target particularly these fast dividing cells. This happens in lower doses. Larger doses have been found to be toxic and not have this anti-neoplastic effect. Not everything is known about the action mechanisms and there may be other not yet found mechanisms. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable which means that this epigenetic mark is passed on to daughter cells when cells replicate. This explains why there is lasting effect after the treatment period. <br />During a sensitive period there is active epigenetic reprogramming when epigenetic marks are removed and layed. During these periods there is increased sensitivity to environmental effects such as drugs, diet, pollutants. <br />The major epigenetically sensitive periods are when epigenetic marks are removed and layed again during early embryogenesis and primordial germ cell developement. There are also tissue specific epigenetic reprogramming periods.<br />Treatment during these periods would risk unknown and possibly adverse effects on other cells than the cancer cells targeted by treatment. This would particularly be of concern when treating young patients. Also, treating young patients whose gametes are still developing would risk passing adverse effects on to future generations as there is evidence of meiotic epigenetic heritability. Also treating pregnant mothers would risk effects on the developing embryo and even the embryo's primordial germ cells thus possibly affecting the third generation. </div>
