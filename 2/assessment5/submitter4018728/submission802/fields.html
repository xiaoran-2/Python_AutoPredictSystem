    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">        Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor or a demethylating agent.<br />        It is a nucleoside analog which gets incorporated into DNA during replication. Decitabine binds to DNA methyl transferase 1 when DNMT1 approaches to methylate the newly synthesized strand. This leads to decrease in concentration of free DNMT1 in the cell and results in DNA hypomethylation. This process depends on an increased DNA replication rate to be effective. Decitabine probably affects all dividing cells but cancer cells which replicate their DNA and divide rapidly will be the most affected.<br />       The hypomethylation will lead to restored function of the genes (regulating the cell cycle) that were abnormally hypermethylated in the cancer cells.  Alternatively the drug can also inhibit DNA synthesis and cause apoptosis mainly in the cancer cells.<br /> It has been effective in treating patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (a hematological malignancy) caused by CpG island hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">    DNA at CpG islands is usually unmethylated because they are often found at the promoters of genes and are protected from methylation, allowing transcription. Some CpG islands in the genome are methylated though and this always leads to silencing of gene expression (of those genes.)<br />   In cancers however there is hypermethylation at certain CpG island promoters (which are usually unmethylated.) These promoters are normally present upstream of tumour suppressor genes and their hypermethylation will silence these genes(no transcription). This along with other genetic or epigenetic mutations like activation of oncogenes can lead to unregulated cell cycles, uncontrolled cell divisions i.e. development of cancer.<br /><br />  Normally, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements in the genome are silenced by DNA methylation to maintain genomic stability. Histone modifications are made and these regions are heterochromatinized. Thus DNA methylation appears to locks them in a silent state. Cryptic promoters in the intergenic regions can lead to disruption of many surrounding genes.<br />      Long terminal repeats at both ends of transposons have strong promoters and these repetitive elements can transpose themselves into  any other region of the genome like upstream of an oncogene (the gene will always be active in all such cells due to the strong promoter) or even within a gene - both these disruptions are mutagenic. <br />    In cancers, there is genome-wide hypomethylation and the intergenic regions, repetitive elements, etc usually become unmethylated. This leads to genomic instability as there will be deletions, duplications, inversions, illegitimate recombination between 2 different chromosomes due to similarity between two repetitive elements (present in those chromosomes) This happens because the repetitive elements are now open and active- euchromatic. All these changes in DNA methylation are mitotically heritable and if rapidly selected for, it can lead to cancer.<br />  Thus alterations in DNA methylation patterns can lead to development of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">    The Igf2/H19 cluster has an imprint control region (ICR) which is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. In this cluster, the Igf2 gene is present upstream of the ICR and downstream the H19 gene and the enhancers(increase the expression of a gene) are present respectively. <br />  In the maternal allele, CTCF an insulator protein binds to the unmethylated ICR and blocks the enhancer's access to the Igf2 gene and it is not expressed. Instead they bind to H19 gene and increase its expression.<br />      When the ICR(in the paternal allele) is methylated the insulator protein CTCF cannot bind to it. The methylation extends to the H19 gene and it is not expressed. Thus the enhancers directly bind to the Igf2 gene and it is expressed.<br />     In Wilm's tumour, there is loss of imprinting (due to mutations, deletions, disruption to DNA methylation in that region) at the maternal allele and its methylation pattern  resembles that of paternal allele thus both alleles behave like the paternal allele. <br />     Therefore overall the H19 gene(responsible for slowing down cell growth) is inactivated and there is over-expression of the Igf2 gene which stimulates growth. These changes can contribute to uncontrolled cell division- cancer.   </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">         DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. DNMT1 recognizes hemi-methylated DNA sequences during replication and copies the exact methylation pattern on the newly synthesized strand. These patterns are inherited by all the daughter cells in the somatic cell's lineage. Therefore  any changes in this DNA methylation pattern hypomethylation/hypermethylation at particular regions in the genome(induced by a drug) will continue to be inherited as they are, even after the drug treatment period is over. Thus epigenetic drugs can have lasting effects.<br />          Sensitive period is the time in the life of an individual when the environment has significant effect on its epigenetic makeup. Epigenetic reprogramming(i.e. active removal and laying down of epigenetic marks in the genome) occurs at this time and it is most sensitive to the environment.<br />          Primordial germ cell development (upto formation of mature sperms and eggs) and early developmental stages (pre-implantation to early post-implantation) are the sensitive periods of development.<br />           If environment(diet, temperature,etc) is disrupted during this period or patients(pregnant women/young children) are treated with drugs that alter the epigenetic machinery during these sensitive periods there can be serious, harmful consequences resulting in altered epigenome, epigenetic abnormalities, aberrant imprinting or deadly cancers. Treatment during these sensitive periods should thus be avoided.</div>
