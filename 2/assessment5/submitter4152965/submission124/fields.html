    <div class="field-value">Cancer can cause CpG islands to become hypermethylated. CpG islands are regions with high frequency of CpG sites that are often found in or near gene promoters. CpG islands are normally unmethylated, but when methylated, they silence the expression of the gene that is regulated by the promoter they are in. When these CpG islands are methylated, tumor suppressor genes are silenced, meaning proliferation is no longer kept under control by cell cycle checkpoints, allowing the cell to divide out of control regardless of DNA damage or cell adhesion. This is the first hit in Knudson's hypothesis.<br /><br />Cancer can also cause intergenic regions and repetitive elements to be demethylated. These DNA elements have various functions in the cell, but are normally methylated to maintain genomic stability, such as preventing transposition and recombination. When there is genome-wide hypomethylation, the genome becomes unstable, causing illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to
neighbouring genes. This in turn can place oncogenes next to active promoters to increase cell proliferation, or disrupt tumour suppressor genes to cause cells to divide out of control. Furthermore, this illegitimate shuffling of genes means that many genes important for cell function stop working, so affected cells no longer perform the functions they did before the epigenetic modifications, but instead do nothing but divide out of control and possibly invade other parts of the body to cause more tumours.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster includes the Igf2 gene (a cell growth factor), the Imprint Control Region (ICR), the H19 gene and downstream enhancers. This gene cluster is paternally imprinted; it is methylated only in the paternal allele. In the maternal allele, the ICR and the H19 gene promoter are unmethylated. A protein called CTCF binds to the ICR, insulating Igf2 from the enhancers. The Igf2 is not expressed, and the H19 gene is expressed instead. In the paternal allele, the ICR and the H19 promoter are methylated. This methylation silences H19 and prevents CTCF from binding to the ICR. The enhancers can now reach the Igf2 gene, allowing it to be expressed.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, the ICR and the H19 gene promoter are hypermethylated. The methylation pattern on the maternal allele becomes the same as that on the paternal allele, resulting in loss of imprinting and both alleles behaving how the paternal allele normally behaves. This results in H19 not being expressed and Igf2 being overexpressed. The latter overexpression of a cell growth factor gene causes excessive cell proliferation (second hit in Knudson's hypothesis).<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor (DNMTi) that can treat cancer by demethylating DNA. It is a nucleoside analogue of deoxycytidine that incorporates into DNA, then irreversibly binds to DNMT, preventing it from methylating further nucleotides. Assuming the cells are still dividing, once DMNT is inhibited by Decitabine, further replicated DNA strands are no longer methylated, causing passive demethylation of DNA. This has an anti-tumour effect (but only at the right amount against certain tumours that cause hypermethylation) because it removes DNA methylation from genes and DNA segments that are hypermethylated in cancers but are not normally methylated, namely CpG islands and Imprint Control Regions, re-enabling the cell cycle checkpoints and reducing the amount of growth factors produced, both of which restore normal cell replication.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic changes are persistent; methylation marks are maintained during every cell division and are passed on to all subsequent generations of cells unless disrupted or erased, and once they are erased, they do not return. This means that DNA methylation alteration causes all subsequently produced cancer cells to carry the same alteration that inhibits their spread, and the drug does not have to be continuously applied for the effect to remain.<br /><br />However, these treatments are not suitable if the patient is pregnant with an embryo that is in a sensitive period, which is a period when epigenetic marks are being established, These sensitive periods are the "Pre-implantation period early development", and the "Primordial germ cell development". If treated with such drugs during these periods, they will alter how the epigenetic marks are established, which may lead to the embryo suffering diseases due to altered epigenetic marks which cause imbalance of expression in potentially disease-causing genes, having malformations or behavioral deficits due to incorrect epigenetic mark establishment during cell differentiation, or even death of the embryo if epigenetic marks are altered too drastically for it to survive the resulting changes.<br /></div>
