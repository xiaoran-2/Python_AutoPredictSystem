    <h1>Submission 88 from Anon (session_user_id: ba6c501c4edef6943f4680c43fdfdc66f3701ee8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes that are the precursors to acute myelogenous leukaemia. It is a nucleoside analogue that, when incorporated into the DNA upon replication, irriversibly binds DNMTs so that they can no longer be released - the drug is therefore replication dependent and since cancer cells divide more rapidlt than normal cells they will be most effected. The exact mechanism is unclear, however it may be due to the effect on the CpG island hypermethylation. The drug"s antineoplastic effect is demonstrated within a theraputic range where it exhibits DNA demethylation, at higher levels it is just toxic.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence the associated gene. In normal cells CpG islands are usually unmethylated, DNA methylation changes in cancer include locus specific hypermethylation at CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes silencing them.This methylation is mitotically heritable and increases with time (reflecting the progress of the cancer) and this recognised as one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis that cancer results fron multiple hits to the DNA. DNA methylation may be of CpG islands of single gens or sets of genes.<br />DNA methylation is also altered at ICRs (imprint control regions) leading to loss of imprint control and this can be through both DNA hyper- and hypomethylation resulting in either over-expression of growth promoting genes or loss of expression of growth restricting genes. <br />In normal cells intergenic regions and repetative elements are usually methylated and these play a role genomic stability. In cancer there is genome wide hypomethylation of these regions and this causes genomic instability which results in illegitimate recombination between repeats resulting in deletions,insertions and reciprocal translocations and the concommitant associated abberant expression.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting disruption in cancer can lead to both over-expression of growth promoting genes or loss of expression of growth restricting genes depending upon whether the ICRs become hyper- or hypomethylated. Normally on the paternal allele the Igf2 cluster is methylated and on the maternal allele unmethylated. When unmethylated, CTCF will bind the insulator element and the enhancers will act on the H19 and the Igf2 is silenced (marenal allele), when methylated, CTFC is not binding and therefore the enhances act on Igf2 and it is expressed (paternal allele).<br />During cancer with the loss of imprinting and the hypermethylation of the maternal allele both alleles express Igf2 (a double dose).  Igf2 is a growth promoter and its over-expression is associated with the childhood kidney tumor - Wilm's tumor. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is very stable and heriditable and therefore passed to subsequent cell generations during cell division continuing its effect indefinately - its effect is enduring. This has the potential to create significant unwanted effects in sensative periods, that is the periods of active cell division during development when DNA methylation is erased and epigentic marks are laid down especially during early embryonic development as well as during primary germ cell development. During these periods disruption of normal cell development would be most potent, potentially giving rise to massive unwanted side effects. <br /></div>
