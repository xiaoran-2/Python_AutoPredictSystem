    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands and CpG island shores normally results in silencing of gene expression.   In normal cells, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated, therefore tumor suppressor genes may be expressed.  <br /><br />In cancer cells, there is an increase in DNA methylation at CpG islands and CpG island shores.  As cancer progresses, there is a progressive increase in DNA methylation at CpG islands associated with promoters of tumor suppressor genes.  The amount and location of hypermethylated CpG islands varies by tumor type and tumor stage.<br /><br />Increased DNA methylation of CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes results in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, contributing to the development of tumors and tumor metastasis.<br /><br />In normal cells, repetitive elements and intergenic intervals are heavily DNA methylated and heterochromatinized.  This helps to maintain genomic stability by minimizing the likelihood of inappropriate deletions, insertions, and recombination of chromosomal DNA resulting from alignment or jumping around of repetitive elements.<br /><br />In cancer cells, there tends to be genome-wide DNA hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions.  This hypomethylation often occurs early in tumor formation and progresses with time.<br /><br />DNA hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions can result in inappropriate chromosomal recombination due to alignment and misalignment of repetitive elements that are not densely packaged into heterochromatin.  When they are hypomethylated, repeats can also be activated, make copies of themselves, and jump around the genome.  This can result in disrupting the coding region of a gene or the activation of neighboring genes.  The overall result is transcriptional aberrations and insertions, deletions, or inappropriate translocation of parts of chromosomes, resulting in genomic instability.  This genomic instability can contribute to the development and progression of cancer or other diseases caused by genetic or epigenetic abnormalities.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, there is DNA methylation at the imprint control region (ICR) for the H19/Igf2 cluster on the paternal allele.  DNA methylation on the paternal allele blocks binding of the protein CTCF, which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers.  Without CTCF binding, the enhancers can access the Igf2 promoter, resulting in expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele.<br /><br />In normal cells, there is a lack of DNA methylation at the ICR on the maternal allele.  This allows  CTCF to bind to the maternal allele, preventing the enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promoter.  This results in a lack of expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, there is DNA methylation at the ICR of the maternal allele, thereby disrupting normal imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster.  The insulator protein CTCF does not bind to the maternal allele, allowing the downstream enhancers to access the Igf2 promoter.  Thus, Igf2 will also be expressed from the maternal allele.  <br /><br />Because Igf2 is growth promoting, the over-expression of Igf2 resulting from the disruption of imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster can result in cancers and other diseases of excessive growth.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that can act as a DNA demethylation agent at an appropriate dosage.  It is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into the DNA during replication.  It can then irreversibly bind DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) during the process of copying DNA methylation to the daughter strand.  The resulting DNMT1 inhibition can result in DNA demethylation when an appropriate dose of the drug is used.<br /><br />Because Decitabine can cause DNA demethylation, it can have an anti-tumor effect in cancers in which there is a high amount of CpG island hypermethylation at tumor suppressor genes, such as in myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia, or AML.  If the CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes are demethylated, the genes may then be expressed and can inhibit tumor growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have long-term effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable. Thus, any alteration of DNA methylation can be passed on to subsequent generations of daughter cells within a cell lineage and can be stably maintained for a long period of time, potentially for a lifetime.  However, there are two periods during which there is extensive reprogramming of DNA methylation.  These periods of DNA methylation reprogramming are sensitive periods and occur during gametogenesis and early embryonic development.  During these periods, DNA methylation is cleared and then re-established (except DNA methylation at imprint control regions during embryonic development).  <br /><br />It would not be advisable to treat patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation during these sensitive periods because altering DNA methylation during time periods of extensive removal and re-establishment of DNA methylation can potentially have widespread and adverse effects on epigenetic marks, normal differentiation and development, and normal gene expression in subsequent generations.  Treating pregnant women could not only potentially have adverse effects on the developing fetus, but by affecting the development of primordial germ cells, could potentially affect a third generation.<br /></div>
