    <div class="field-value">In normal cell CpG islands are hypomethylated, otherwise in a cancer cell where CpG islands are frequently hypermethylated and are a clear hallmark in a variety of tumour types.<br />CpG islands are generally localized in promoter regions and the fact that they are normally hypomethylated mean that the promoter is in an active state and the correspondent gene can be transcribed.<br />CpG island hypermethylation frequently results in tumour suppressor genes silencing. CpG island hypermethylation contributes to cancer mainly because is mitotically heritable and can confer a selective advantage to a cell, for instance in terms of survival capacity, so that these epimutations are positively selected; furthermore CpG island hypermethylation accumulates with age.<br />Also genome-wide hypomethylation is a common feature in tumours and progresses with time. The hypomethylation seems to occur more frequently in repetitive elements than in intergenic regions.<br />The methylation state, both in repeats and in intergenic regions, contributes to genetic stability, so the hypomethylation in these places destabilizes the genome in a variety of ways. For instance recombination between repeats normally doesn't occur because the methylation confers them etherochromatin state. In altered conditions, when hypomethylation occurs, these regions become opened and can recombine determining translocations. For the same reason, the repetitive elements can make copies of themselves and transpose altering gene expression.<br />DNA methylation in cancer is refferred to as context dependent, in the sense that tumours can result or by tumour suppressor hypermethylation or by chromosomal instability. These findings play a pivotal role in epigenetic therapy, in fact decreasing DNA methylation could help to suppress tumorigenesis in the first case, but would have opposite effect in the second one. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Many of imprinting genes are involved in promoting or in suppressing growth. More specifically, alterations in DNA methylation (hypomethylation or hypermethylation) at Imprinting Control Region (ICR) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or in overexpression of growth promoting genes.<br />In referring to H19/Igf2 cluster, normally IRC is methylated on the paternal allele but it is unmethylated on the maternal allele.<br />Because the IRC methylation on the paternal allele, the enhancers can act on Igf2 and this gene is expressed. On the maternal allele, because IRC is unmethylated, CTFC, defined as an insulator element, can bind to IRC and in this way the enhancers can act on H19, but not on  Igf2 that so is silenced. When loss of imprinting occurs, ICR on maternal allele get also methylated, so Igf2 will be expressed from both paternal and maternal allele. This double expression of Igf2  double the production of correspondent hormone which stimulates growth and for this reason is associated to Wilm's tumour. Activation of maternal allele, early in development is also associated with Beckwith- Wiedmann syndrome whose main symptom is overgrowth and children with this syndrome have indeed  an increase risk of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and it is a DNA-demethylating agent. This molecule belongs to nucleoside analogs, ideed it is a cytidine analog like azacitidine. These compounds, after their cellular uptake need to be metabolically activated, via phosphorylation, by conversion in the correspondent nucleotide. The inhibition of DNA methylation is due to formation of a covalent complex between Decitabine and DNMT1 at CpG methylation sites, resulting in the inactivation of this enzyme, irreversibly linked.  By this process, normal function to the tumor suppessor genes could be restored reestablishing proliferative control and apoptosis sensitivity. Decitabine has toxic effects at higher doses while induces demethylation at lower doses. Probabily Decitabine hits more specifically dividing cells. Many trials are being conducted also on solid tumours, to better understand the exact mechanism of action. Some trials are considering synergic effect with Histone deacetylases and/or standard chemoterapeutics.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic modifications are mitotically heritable. For instance DNA methylation is maintained through mitosis by the DNMT1 enzyme which recognizes hemi-methylated DNA following DNA replication. This mechanism confers the methylation state to newly formed cells, establishing the epigenetic inheritance. Drugs might affect DNA methylation pattern and this means that an altered pattern will be inherited.<br />Sensitive periods, in epigenetic context, are early development and primordial germ cells development,  when clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks take place. During these periods would be inadvisable treating patients since epigenetic drugs could severely interfere with the normal methylation pattern resulting in diseases. Also adolescent patients must be considered in a sensitive period since they are maturing germ cells.</div>
