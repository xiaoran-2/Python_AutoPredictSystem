    <div class="field-value">The DNA methylation at CpG islands  is a biochemical process in which a methyl group is added to a cytosine. Active genes tend to be unmethylated at this CpG islands. So, methylation of theses CpG islands is important to silence the gene. <br />DNA <b>hypermethylation</b> of CpG islands specially at the promotor regions of tumor suppressor genes is a well stablished mechanism of gene inactivation. CpG hypermethylation has been described almost in every tumor.<br />By silencing tumor suppressor genes by promoters of hypermethylation of CpG it contributes to cancer.<br />This disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer .<br />Intergenic regions ===(<span><strong>Historically intergenic regions have sometimes been called junk DNA suggesting that they have no function. However, it has been known for a long time that these regions do contain functionally important elements such as promoters and enhancers</strong>) == </span>and repetitive elements</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele the ICR (imprint control regions) is methylated so CTCF does not bind an therefore enhancers stimulate directly Igf2. So Igf2 is express in the paternal allele.<br />In the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated so CTCF will bind and enhancers will act on H19 and Igf2 will silenced in the maternal allele.<br /> With loss of imprinting of the maternal allele also; they are both hypermethylated and they both show expression of Igf2. <br />Igf2 is growth promoting and this is associated with Wilm's Tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is chemically a cytidine analog and its mechanism of action is hypomethylating agent. It <b>hypomethylates</b> inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (Decitaine. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia). Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation causing hypomethylation of the DNA of neoclassic cells and may restore normal function of genes that are critical for the control cellular differentiation and proliferation (FDA Decitabine full prescribing information).<br />DNA methylation  is an epigenetic modification that plays an important role in gene control of gene expression. DNA methylation at cytosine residues in gene promoter CpG islands is known to inhibit gene transcription (Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2003 Dec;12(12):1985-93.DNA methylation in haematological malignancies: the role of decitabine.Hennessy BT1, Garcia-Manero G, Kantarjian HM, Giles FJ. ). In appropriate inhibition of tumor suppressor genes, metastasis and genes involved in DNA repair by uncontrolled methylation can lead to unregulated growth and proliferation of cells and carcinogenesis. By blocking methylation it can correct this.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dr. Stephen Baylin postulates that epigenetic drugs, unlike other forms of gene regulation (such as those in transcriptional factors), can have a long lasting effect because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. And once erased, they do not come back. <br />Sensitive period for DNA methylation most be considered. Since alters patterns of methylation during sensible periods are associated with diseases. This usually occurs during early development until epiblast stage and then again during primordial germ cells development till gamete formation. <br />Both periods in which DNA methylation is very low. <br />Treating patient during these periods may lead to carcinogenesis.</div>
