    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can lead to eigther expression or silence of both parental alleles. In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the two genes of interest, H19 and Igf2 are controled by the imprint control region (ICR) of the cluster which is located between them. In normal cells, the ICR of the maternal allele is not methylated, so CTCF can bind to the ICR, preventing the enhancers of binding and promoting the expression of Igf2. Instead, the enhancers bind to and promote the transcription of H19. On the contrary, the paternal allele has its ICR as well as the promoter of H19 methylated.This methylation pattern inhibits CTCF to bind to ICR, therefore the enhancers are able to bind to Igf2, resulting in expression of the latter, which leads to growth of the cell. In Wilm's tumor, we find hypermethylation of ICR not only in the paternal, but at the maternal allele as well. This disruption of imprinting leads to overexpression of the Igf2 gene which in turn leads to increase growth stimulation to the cell, eventually leading to tumorigenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the epigenetic feature that is studied the most in cancer. It occurs almost exclusively CpG dinucleotides. There are regions in the genome that CpGs are found in high numbers, named CpG islands. These are often found at the promoters of genes. Although CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation, when methylation occurs this is universally synonymous to silencing of the specific gene (the promoter of which has its CpGs methylated). However, there are other sites on the genome, except gene promoters, in which CpGs are found, for example repetitive elements, intergenic regions and intragenic regions such as the introns of genes. Methylation on these sites of DNA usually functions protectively, preventing genomic instability, eigther by silencing cryptic gene promoters found in intergenic regions or by silencing and mutating repeats, thus preventing both their transposition, the transcriptional interference from strong promoters and the illegitimate recombination of repeats. In the normal cell, CpG islands tend to be hypomethylated, while CpG dinucleotides found in repetitive elements and intergenic regions are usually methylated. On the contrary, in cancer we observe the opposite; CpG islands are hypermethylated and there is a genome-wide hypomethylation. This reverse in DNA methylation contributes to cancer in two major ways. First of all CpG island hypermethylation leads to silencing of tumor-supressing genes, which promote tumorgenesis. There is also a hypomethylation in CpG poor promoters, something that usually results in activation of genes that contribute to cancer (oncogenes such as R-RAS, genes that code for miRNA that target tumor supressor genes). Furthermore, hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions leads to genomic instability mainly because of illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation and transposition of repeats, as well as because of activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an antineoplastic drug that afffects epigenetic processes. More specifically, it belongs to the DNMT inhibitors class (DNMTi). As DNMT functions to transmit the DNA methylation pattern from one cellular generation to another, once it is inhibited the methylation pattern won't be passed down to the next cellular generations. In other words, Decitabine acts as a DNA-demethylating agent. Up until now, Decitabine has been used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which are the precusors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. The mechanism of action is still unclear, however it could be that the reduction of tumor supressor gene hypermethylation leads to better prognosis for these specific types of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation patterns can define which genes are allowed to be expressed. However, the methylation pattern of a genome is subject to change if apropriate drugs are administered. The changing of DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because once altered and the drugs are inhibited, the new metylation pattern will be passed down to the future cell generations unaltered. However there are some sensitive periods of development that drugs that alter DNA methylation shouldn't be used. During these sensitive periods epigenetic reprogramming occurs and new methylation patterns are set. Examples of sensitive periods of development are the early embryonic development (soon after fertilization) and the periods of primordial cell development and gametogenesis. Treating patients with epigenetic drug during sensitive periods should be avoided, due to the potential effects to the next generation. For instance, giving epigenetic drugs to a pregnant woman will almost certainly have a major impact to the health of the embryo.</div>
