    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><ol><li><p>Tumor accumulate high
levels of DNA methylation during tumor progression.normally in about 60% of
promoters have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation
independent of their activity state.</p></li><li><p>During during tumor
formation there is hypermethylation  of these sites(CIMP-CpG island
methylator phenotype) that causes silenciing of the underlying genes.CIMP allows for a
sub-classification of tumors and also determines metastatic potential, There is
also aberrant DNA methylation in cancer in CpG island shores- the
2 kb regions surrounding CpG islands,which get hypermethylated.</p></li><li><p>The
tumor suppressing genes do not get expressed due to this methylation
as a result causing the cells to proliferate abnormally.Also,stochastic methylation
variability has been detected in cancer specific differentially methylated
regions (cDMRs), which might contribute to tumor heterogeneity. 3D chromatin
architecture and the epigenetic reprogramming in cancer cells have been fouund
to have a link-DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes leads to loss of
CTCF binding in multiple tumor cell lines coincides with silencing of
p16INK4a and the loss of an upstream chromatin boundary.</p></li><li><p>Many developmental genes that are silenced by H3K27me3 in embryonic stem
cells are silenced by DNA methylation in cancer cells, establishing an
epigenetic switch from a dynamic to a more stable silencing system promoting a
stem cell-like signature of cancer cells.</p></li><li><p> Shifting the
balance of methylation can result in either promotion or restriction of tumor
proliferation. A recent finding-histone deacetylase HDAC1, associated with cell
cycle arrest,induces tumor proliferation in a teratoma mouse model.</p></li><li><p> Altered epigenetic
patterns in cancer cells are also associated with the deregulation of lncRNAs
and subsequent re-positioning of chromatin modifying complexes,that leads to
further disruption of normal cell functioning.
Intergenic  methylation is also found in repetitive
sequences-satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions-LINEs and
SINEs in human DNA.</p></li></ol></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster,the ICR is on the paternal allele i.e it is imprinted paternally.<br />H19 is the lncRNA from the maternal allele that is expressed-inhibits expression by targeting the H3K9 histone methyltransferase G9a to the Slc22a3 promoter. The maternal allele ICR is unmethylated annd bound by CTCF-an insulator protein that isulated Igf2 from downstream of enhancers and increases expression of enhancers to act on H19 and the expression proceeds by secondary preference of enhancers-first preference been to act on to the Igf2 promoters,increasing their expression,but it gets blocked by the CTCF protein.<br />In paternal allele-methylation of ICR-no CTCF binds-DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter,for silencing. The enhancers get access to their primary preference of Igf2-activating its expression. Therefore maternally imprinted.<br />In cancer cells due to unregulated methylation pattern,there is a chnage in the nuclear structure,chromatin texture.<br /><span>Rearrangements of genomic organization causing deregulated gene expression patterns and aberrant chromatin structure, which is in line with recent findings related to aberrant DNA methylation in cancer cells and provides a route to altered epigenetic patterning in cancer.<br />Beckwith-wiedemann syndrome-an imprinted disorder which is caused by the maternal allele behaving like paternal,only one of the two genes produced in high quantity-uniparental disomy.During the excessive production of Igf2 there is fetal and post natal overgrowth,macroglossa and high predispsition to embryonic/childhood tumors,e.g-Wilm's tumor,causing cancer. <br /><br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span> Decitabine, are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. They are a class of histone demethylating agents. these epigenetic drugs can make the tumor susceptible to chemotherapy agents.<br /></span><span> This inhibits the activity of an enzyme called EZH2- attaches methyl groups to histone proteins,a part of the chromosomal packaging. A lot of lymphomas—cancers of the immune system—are caused by mutations that make EZH2 overactive,which methylates histones more than they should be,silencing the tumour-suppressor genes that stop the uncontrolled cell growth causing cancer.<br /></span>Hence this drug makes the chromosomes free of methylation.which ensures easy access of the transcription factors to the DNA regions.helping in their expression,basically pf the tumor supressor genes that keep the proliferation rate of cells at check,inhibting cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Stephen Baylin, has shown that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine(DNA demythylase) slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer.Patirnts of the study who did not show much response to the trial itself then went on to show an unexpectedly good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them next,there might be a possibility that these epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.<br /></span><span>Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, they do not return.It might be that the epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.<br /></span>Epigenetic reprogramming of cells occur in the sensitive periods of develpoment-primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development(pre-implantation period),here in these phases of the cell cycle the specific epigenetic marks get erased and are formed again,in the course of development.<br />Treating patients during these sensitive periiods would not lead to a permanent solution or treatment to the disease as the epigenetic drugs re-structuring the genome would have the chance of been erased and reprogrammed,hence it is inadviisable to treat during such periods. </div>
