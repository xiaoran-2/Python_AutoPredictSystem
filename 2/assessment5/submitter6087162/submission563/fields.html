    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally CpG islands tend to be free from methylation. In the case of cancer we see that tumor suppressor genes CpG islands are hypermethylated, this leads to silencing of genes, that's why the process of tumor suppression in cancer patiensts decreases. In the healthy individuals intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated, but in cancer patients we see genome-wide hypomethylation, therefore <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements become very active and instable, that leads to karyotype abnormality and increasing of tumorgenesis.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Each individual normally has one active copy of an imprinted gene. <span> The maternally-expressed </span><i>H19</i><span> gene and paternally-expressed </span><i>Igf2</i>gene share enhancers and their reciprocal imprinting is governed by a CTCF-dependent insulator that is located between the genes.<span> On the paternal chromosome, methylation at the ICR not only prevents CTCF from binding, allowing </span><i>Igf2</i><span> to engage the enhancers, but it is also required for methylation at the </span><i>H19</i><span> promoter and silencing of </span><i>H19.</i><span>On the maternal allele in mouse, CTCF binds to 4 binding sites within the ICR, generating an insulator that prevents </span><i>Igf2</i><span> from accessing the shared enhancers that are located on the </span><i>H19</i> side of the insulator. Thus, the insulator effectively acts as an enhancer-blocker.Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome is caused by maternal allele behaving like paternal allele. There are three mechanisms:  mutation/deletion to cause loss of imprinting, uniparental disomy, two copies of one parental chromosome, epigenetic disruption for loss of imprinting.<span>Wilm’s tumour is caused due to </span>predisposition to embryonic/ childhood tumours,<div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to drugs targeting enzymatic epigenetic regulators. It is nuceloside analogues which binds DNMT(DNA methyltransferases) therefore it division dependent. In a lower dose it acts very good binding cancer cells more often then normall cells ( because cancer cells divides more frequent)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation in some cases can play bad role as a treatment. Every cell is treated by these drugs, so in young people it can leads to dramatic effect(long term effect), because they can be in sensitive period of their development. Sensitive period is the period, when the cells are sensitive to environment conditions. It can be a period, when they produce germ cells. So treating patients with these drugs can leads to unpredictable consequence in the next generations,</div>
