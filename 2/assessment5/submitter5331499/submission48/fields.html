    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally CpG islands are not methylated. <br />In cancer, however, they get hypermethylated, causing silencing of the underlying gene. <br />This underlying gene is often a promoter for tumor suppressing genes.<br /><br />lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) are transcribed from intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br />Functional lncRNAs fulfill important regulatory roles in gene expression
 by assembling protein complexes and localizing them to 
their genomic target DNA sequence.<br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can lead to disruption of this regulation, therefore creating chance to develop cancer.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There is an imprint control region which acts on H19/lgf2 cluster. Normally this region is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. <br />Therefore, Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele and expressed from the paternal allele. <br />Loss of imprinting in maternal allele causes lgf2 be expressed from both paternal and maternal allele. <br />Since lgf2 stimulates cell growth, it can lead to Wim's tumor. <br />This loss of imprinting can also lead to other different types of cancer.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents. <br />By disrupting cancer-provoking methylation pattern, it indirectly influences development of tumors.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation erases cancer-provoking epigenetic changes, and once erased, they are not passed on during cell division to daughter cells. This stops a cancer growing without having to kill all 
its cells. <br />Sensitive periods are the periods when epigenetic marks are set or erased. There are two most sensitive periods - germ-cell development and embryo development. If we disrupt epigenetic process during these phases, the result can be unpredictable, that's why it is not recommended.<br /></div>
