    <h1>Submission 443 from Anon (session_user_id: c3d5d7f52017fe75420f7b0cc088fcaa1ba28cbd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a nucleoside analog which is incorporated into DNA during replication and then binds irreversibly to DNA methyltransferase inhibiting it and reducing DNA methylation. Therefore this is the reason why it was classified as a DNA - demethylating agent. Considering that in cancer, tumour repressor genes are inactivated by methylation of their CpG islands then we could say that the drug mentioned would increase the expression of these genes and thereby slow tumour growth.<br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that can happen in CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements. CpG islands are usually at gene promoters and when they are methylated this results on gene silencing via formation of a repressive chromatin structure or prohibiting binding of transcription factors. In normal cells, CpG methylation is not common, while in cancer cells there is a significant rise of this methylation, especially in tumour suppressor genes which is tought to contribute to cancer development. 
Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated, which grants genomic integrity because it prevents illegitimate transpositions and silences cryptic promoters that could cause interference in expression of other genes. That is why genome wide hypomethylation seen In cancer cells provokes genomic instability and leads to loss of imprinting, oncogene activation via poor promoters demethylation and interference of other genes expression because transpositions all of which can cause tumours development.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, the H19/Igf2 cluster in the maternal allele usually has an insualtor protein (CTCF) binded to the ICR which diverts enhancers from Igf2 to H19. While in the paternal alelle the ICR is methylated preventing the binding of CTCF and allowing the enhancers to act on the Igf2. 
On the other hand in wilms tumour both alleles have their ICRs methylated and act as a paternal allele which leads to an overexpression of Igf2, an oncogene that stimulates growth. Considering this we can understand that a disruption in the imprinting of this cluster can lead to cancer development because it alters the way and the quantity in which genes are expressed.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation has the characteristic of being mitotically heritable, and that is why even if a treatment which causes its reduction is suspended. the efects achieved with said traitment will endure even longer thanks to the natural mechanisms like DNMT1 that are involved in maintaining DNA methylation through mitosis.<br />This is also a reason that must be considered when using these treatments during a period when epigenetic marks are being established (sensitive periods) such as early embrionic development or after primordial germ cells development. Because is in this periods precisely, when all epigenetic marks specific of diferent organs come to happen. And if we interfere with a drug in these important phases we could cause severe disruptions of developing cells, not only during treatment but also after it has been suspended. </div>
