    <div class="field-value"><div>CpG islands, often at promoters of genes,  are usually unmethylated independent of activation. Methylated CpG in a CpG island is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure, and also can prohibit transcription factor binding, and alter gene expression. So the normal function of methylation at CpG island refers to silencing of gene expression, although small subset of CpG islands are dynamically methylated between cell types.<br /><div>The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity,since Dnmt1 null cells display genomic instability, and you may see it can silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites.<br /><div>The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is also to maintain genomic integrity by silencing and mutation of repeats to prevent transposition, transcriptional interference and illegitimate recombination. Moreover, it can form a genome defense model.</div></div></div><div>In a normal cell, CPG islands are usually hypomethylated. But the rest of the genome in general is hypermethylated in their repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and  in the introns of genes.</div><div>In contrast, in a cancer cell, the CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated although they are not all methylated. But the rest of the genome in general is hypomethylated in their repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and in the introns of genes.</div><div>This methylation at CpG islands is found in cancer, called CpG island hypermethylation. In general, these CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. So a cancer cell is able to inactivate tumor suppressor genes epigenetically by silencing the tumor suppressor gene by locking in a silent inactive state via CpG island hypermethylation.</div><div>Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic intervals may cause genomic Instability, by illegitimate recombination between repeats,</div><div>activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding. CTCF is an insulator protein. It insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate.<br />In the maternal allele, there is no DNA methylation at ICR, so CTCF binds ICR to prevent activating Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Then enhancers can activate unmethylated H19.<br />In Wilm's tumour, both the paternal and maternal allele contain hypermethylation of ICR, leading to Igf2 overexpression, thus, lossing of imprinting.<br /><div>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes like H19, overexpression of growth promoting genes like Igf2. So the cells become immortal and indeed, the cancer cells.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is one type of DNA-demethylating
agents.<br />Since epigenetic
processes are susceptible to chemical intervention and epigenetic alterations are reversible, so drugs can alter epigenetic status of DNA. <br />As a DNA-demethylating agent, Decitabine can increase genome-wide hypomethylation on repetitive and intergenic regions, CpG poor promoters and ICRs, leading to genomic instability by illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes, and indeed oncogene activation and lossing of imprinting.Therefore, it may enhance tumorigenesis.<br />But it can also decrease locus specific hypermethylation, leading to less methylated CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour<div>suppressor genes, which can suppress tumorigenesis.</div>Since myelodysplastic
syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia is mainly driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation, the function of depletion of DNA methylation of Decitabine appears to suppress tumorigenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Unlike
other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for
example), epigenetic changes like DNA methylation are passed on during cell division to daughter and
granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they
do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect
changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.<br />Sensitive periods are periods when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control and epigenetic marks are established rather than maintained during the time.<div>The period from primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperm seems to be one sensitive period. The second sensitive period is the pre-implantation period and early post-implantation period.<br />Both of these periods are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome.<br /><div>The reason why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable is the fact of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through the gametes, and this actually is because of some transmission of epigenetic marks laid or removed by <span>epigenetic drugs</span> through the germ line, therefore, influence the offspring. And another reason is that the epigenetic reprogramming will be disrupted, which will lead to disorders and diseases.</div><div><br /></div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
