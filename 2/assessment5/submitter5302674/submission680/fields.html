    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are regions where there is a high concentration of CpG motifs. In about 60% of the genes that code for proteins, the promoters lie within CpG islands, which are usually free of DNA methylation. When genes are active, the levels of DNA methylation in the CpG islands are low. The CpG islands tend to be highly methylated only when the genes are switched off. As different cell types express different genes, CpG methylation patterns are different across different cell types. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions is inversely correlated with gene expression. <br /><br />When DNA is methylated, it binds to a protein called MeCP2). However, MeCP2 will not bind to unmethylated CpG motifs. Once MeCP2 binds to a gene promoter it seems to do several things. <br /><ul><li>It attracts other proteins that help to switch the gene off <br /></li><li>It might also stop DNA transcription machinery from binding to the gene promoter</li><li>When promoter region in highly methylated, DNA becomes supercoiled, gene transcription machinery cannot have access and that region of the chromosome shuts down </li></ul>In cancer cells CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated causing the silencing of the gene to which they "promote". In cancer cells, DNA methylation causes a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This originates genomic instability and deregulation of tissue-specific and imprinted genes, in addition to silencing tumor suppressor genes through the methylation of their promoter CpG island. <span>CpG island hypermethylation has been described in almost every tumor type.<br /></span><br />DNA methylation main function at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genetic integrity. DNMT1 null cells display genomic instability causing deletions, reciprocal translocations and/or insertions. The silencing of repeats through DNA methylation prevents transposition, avoids transcriptional interference with strong promoters, and prevents illegitimate recombinations. In cancer intergenic/repeat regions are hypomethylated causing genetic instability.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is expressed in normal tissues solely from the paternal allele, and H19-gene is transcribed from the maternal allele. A DMR upstream of H19 and a set of tissue specific enhancers downstream of H19.  The enhancers specifically activate Igf2 on the paternal chromosome and H19 on the maternal chromosome. The interactions between the enhancers and the genes are regulated by the DMR, which methylated DMR on the paternal chromosome inactivates adjacent H19  and an unmethylated DMR on the maternal chromosome insulates Igf2 from the enhancers. These processes appear to involve methyl-CpG binding proteins, histone deacetylases and the formation of chromatin insulator complexes. </p><p></p><p><span>The <i>H19</i> locus belongs to a cluster of imprinted genes that is linked to the human Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. The expression of <i>H19</i> and its closely associated <i>IGF2</i> gene is frequently deregulated in some human tumors, such as Wilms' tumors. In these cases, biallelic <i>IGF2</i> expression and lack of expression of<i>H19</i> are associated with hypermethylation of the imprinting center of this locus. </span>In Wilm´s tumor, biallelic expression of <i>IGF2</i> has been observed in association with loss of methylation at a DMR in <i>IGF2.</i> This DMR, has been shown to be methylated on the silent maternal <i>IGF2</i> allele.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth.  When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. Decitabine is a member of a new class of drugs known as DNA "demethylating" agents. Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor which incorporates into DNA and inhibits DNA methyltransferase, the enzyme that is responsible for methylating newly synthesized DNA in mammalian cells. This results in hypomethylation of DNA  and therefore <span> normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. </span>Decitabine is cell cycle specific and acts peripherally in the S phase of the cell cycle. It does not inhibit the progression of cells from the G1 to S phase.<p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes are passed to daughter cells yet. Already existing methylation patterns are transferred to daughter cells through DNMT1; whereas, de novo methylation is implanted through DNMT3A and DNMT3B.  This way, when a cell divides, epigenetic marks are transferred. <br />There are some sensitive periods in which there is an increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms, in other words, when altered environment have an effect on epigenetic control. There are two main sensitive periods during development: during germ cell development and early embryonic development. Treating patients during sensitive periods might be dangerous since the target of the drugs might me fundamental epigenetic marks instead of cancer originating epigenetic mark. Thus, demethylating genes that should be methylated, activating or desactivating the incorrect ones, could have devastating consequences. This change might last through life and its consequences might be devastating. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
