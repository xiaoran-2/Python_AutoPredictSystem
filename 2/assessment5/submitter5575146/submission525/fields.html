    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation keeps a check on the gene expression at CpG islands, by acting as a switch which can trigger gene expression, upon unmethylation (most cases) or suppress expression upon methylation (most cases).<br /></li><li>Due to genetic alterations (Point mutation, Translocation,amplification, Deletion, CNV)  as well as epigenetic alterations, DNA  methylation could be disrupted during cancer.</li><li>Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG Islands could lead to induction of oncogenes (by hypomethylation) as well as suppression of tumor suppressor genes (by hypermethylation) and like this it contributes in destabilisation of genomic machinery thus leading to cancer. Also DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and hence is preferred over mutations as a mode of induction of genetic instability.</li><li>Under normal conditions, Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated and thus kept in an inactivated state to maintain genomic stability.</li><li>However during cancer, Intergenic regions and repetitive elements become unmethylated and this leads to their activation which further induces genomic instability.</li><li>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally kept inactive because they could lead to transposon, piRNA, miRNA formation, and if these are allowed to expressed, then these could lead to genetic alterations like Translocation,amplification, Deletion, CNV etc that could contribute significantly in cancer.<br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Under normal conditions, the region where CTCF binds in methylated in PATERNAL ALLELE, and due to this reason CTCF could not bind. As a result of this, the enhancers are able to bind and induce the expression of IGF2.</li><li>In MATERNAL ALLELES,  due to CTCF binding, enhancers are not able to bind to IGF2, although they bind to H19 and induces its expression.</li><li>During Wilm's tumour CTCF does not bind to its site in both maternal as well as paternal alleles and thus enhancers binds to IGF2 and induces its expression. As a consequence, in this tumour type, there is a doubling of IGF2 expression.</li><li>This doubling of IGF2 protein level leads to abnormal growth as IGF2 is responsible for the regulation of growth promoting genes (induced in Wilm's tumour), growth restriction genes (suppression in Wilm's tumour) thus contributing to cancer.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a cytidine analogue<br /></li><li>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It acts by incorporating into DNA strands and inducing hypomethylation.<br /></li><li><span>Decitabine acts as an <i>anti-metabolite.</i> It seems to work by having a toxic effect on the abnormal (MDS) cells.  It works by switching off a protein called <a>DNA</a> methyltransferase. This switches on genes that stop the cancer cells growing and dividing. This promotes normal specialization and blood cell growth, so that the body is better able to make red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. <br /></span></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Epigenetic changes (that includes DNA methylation) are  mitotically heritable (passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased). It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. Hence, by altering these DNA methylation (and other epigenetic processes) enduring effects could be obtained.</li><li>Early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms (<span> DNA methylation, chromatin conformational changes through histone modifications, ncRNAs and, most recently, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine). This period is known as Sensitive period.</span><br /></li><li>Sensitive periods of development broadly includes  1) Proginitor germ cell development and 2) Early development<br /></li><li>It is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because by doing so, there is a strong chance of altering the epigenetic cycles (clearing of epigenetic marks, Imprinted genes, IAP's etc) and this could pose a long lasting effects on the life of an individual.</li></ul><br /></div>
