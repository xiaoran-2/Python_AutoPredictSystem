    <div class="field-value">Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression. This is achieved either through binding special proteins that repress expression and/or bind chromatin remodelers, or via preventing transcription factors from binding.<br /><br />In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated (i.e. more cytosines are methylated then in healthy cells).<br /><br />Hypermethylation of CpG islands leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes. This weakens the downregulation of oncogenes and contributes to cancer.<br /><br />Normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to prevent expression and following transposition of repetive elements, to prevent chromosomal instability caused by repetitive elements, and to prevent cryptic promoters from activating expression of silenced genes.<br /><br />In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated (i.e. less cytosines are methylated then in healthy cells).<br /><br />Hypomethiylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to:<br /><br />1) activating cryptic promoters in otherwise silenced oncogenes, thus contributing to cancer;<br /><br />2) activating expression and further spread of transposable elements through the genome, which can lead to disruption of tumor supressor genes or activation of oncogenes, thus contributing to cancer;<br /><br />3) promoting genome instability (duplications and deletions of chromosome parts, the illegitimate chromosomal translocations due to similarity of non-homologous chromosome structure caused by presence of identical repetitive elements in both chromosomes). This can lead to cell having decreased dosage of tumor supressor genes (through deletion of individual genes or breaking them up during translocation) or increased dosage of oncogenes (through duplication of individual genes, or translocating normally silenced gene next to active promoter of other gene), or both, thus contributing to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of gene imprinting can contribute to cancer by either incresing the expression of oncogenes (e.g. previously imprinted oncodene is expessed from both parents' chromosomes) or by decreasing expression of tumor suppressor genes (e.g. tumor suppressor gene is silenced on both parents' chromosomes). An example of this is disruption of imprinting in H19/IGF2 cluster caused by hypermethylation of imprint control regions (ICRs).<br /><br />Under normal conditions, the cluster's ICR is methylated on paternal chromosome. This prevents an insulating protein (CTCF) from binding to it and allows distant gene enhancers to stimulate expression of oncogene IGF2 that encodes hormone insulin-like growth factor 2, which promotes growth during gestation.<br /><br />On maternal chromosome, ICR is unmethylated and CTCF can bind there. CTCF prevents gene enhancers from affecting IFG2 gene and "redirects" them to stimulate expression of H19 gene, which encodes long non-coding RNA.<br /><br />In case of Wilm's tumor (kidney cancer), the cluster's ICRs are methylated on both paternal and maternal chromosomes.<br /><br />Insulators cannot bind to any of ICRs, and enhancers are free to stimulate IGF2. This leads to doubling the dosage of oncogene IGF2, which now is expressed from both chromosomes. Affected cells grow more vigorously than normal, and may become cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents.<br /><br />The word "demethylating" means "removing methylation", so it may be presumed that Decitabine is removing methyl groups from cytosine bases of DNA.<br /><br />Anti-tumor effect of Decitabine is based on countering hypermethylation of cancer cells' DNA. This can reactivate tumor suppressor genes which were silenced due to methylation of their promoters. The activated tumor supressor genes, in turn, will inhibit growth of cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation pattern is mytotically heritable (daughter cells retain dividing cell's pattern) due to action of de novo methyltransferaze enzymes, which copy the methylation pattern from template strand of DNA to newly replicated strand. This action is in essence a maintenance of DNA methylation pattern which continues throughout the life of an organism.<br /><br />However, there are periods in the development of the organism when DNA methylation pattern undergoes a complete overhaul: old patterns are erased and new patterns are established. These periods are called sensitive.<br /><br />In human development, there are two sensitive periods: one during early embryo development (from the stage of fertilized egg to the stage of epiblast), the other during the development of primordial germ cells.<br /><br />Interfering in the resetting of DNA methylation during sensitive periods via treatment with epigenetic drugs may potentially lead to disruption of the process and result in errors in DNA methylation patterns which then would be mythotically inherited by all cells decsenadnt to cell in which the error first occured. Thus <span>treating patients with such drugs during sensitive periods would be inadvisable, unless patient survival depends on it.</span></div>
