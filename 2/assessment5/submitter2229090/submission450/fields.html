    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>CpG islands are often at promoters of genes and tend to be protected from methylation. DNA methylation at CpG island is associated with silencing of its gene expression. In cancer cells CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated. Hypermethylation of CpG islands is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure. It prohibits transcription factor binding and causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes, contributing to cancer.</p><p>On the other hand, Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is associated with maintaining genomic integrity such as silencing of repeats to prevent transposition. DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability. Genomic Instability includes illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes, contributing to cancer.</p><div><span><br /></span></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele, and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. </p><p>When it's unmethylated CTCF binds its insulator element and the enhancers will act on H19. But Igf2 from the maternal allele will be silent, so we don't see expression of Igf2. </p><p>On the paternal allele, because this is methylated, now the enhancers can act on Igf2, because CTCF is not binding to inhibit this, and Igf2 is expressed from the pattern allele. </p><p>However, with loss of imprinting hypermethylation or hypomethylation of the imprint control region can occur, lead to over/under expression of growth promoting Igf2 and contribute to cancer</p><p>In Wilm’s tumour, for example, the imprint control region on the maternal allele is hypermethylated and Igf2 is overexpressed.</p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. It demethylates DNA by irreversibly binding DNMTs after it gets incorporated into DNA. When there is an increase in DNA methylation at CpG islands this can result in silencing suppressor genes that regulate cell division and growth. When suppressor genes are silenced, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. Through DNA demethylation by Decitabine, normal function of the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. This implies its effect is replication dependent.</p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. That is, it can be passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells. Although DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark, reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during a sensitive period.</p><p>A sensitive period is a period of the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks during which altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control. Usually, the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development are sensitive periods.</p><p>It would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods, especially young patients developing germ cells because taking drugs that inhibit the epigenetic machinery can disrupt epigenetic reprogramming and cause serious side effects.</p><br /></div>
