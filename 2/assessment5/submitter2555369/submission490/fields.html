    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Silenced DNA is heavily methylated preventing Transcription by RNA polymerase whereas Active DNA is demethylated allowing transcription by RNA polymerase. Thus altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects leading to various cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and psychiatric disorders in adulthood.<br /></li><li>Sensitive period is defined as  period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals, eg. in vitro culture.</li><li> In simpler words it as an early life period during which  there is increased sensitivity to regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, chromatin conformational changes through histone modifications, ncRNAs and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.<br /></li><li><span>DNA methylation plays  significant role in cancer, from  silencing of tumor suppressors to activation of oncogenes and promotion of metastasis. Recent studies also suggest a role for DNA methylation in drug resistance.Elucidation of epigenetic mechanisms may also lead to  development of new treatments that specifically target epigenetic abnormalities or vulnerabilities in cancer cells. Examples of two such classes of drugs include DNA demethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors, which have shown promise in  treatment of leukemia and T-cell lymphoma, respectively<span>. A combination of drugs that target epigenetic factors, together with conventional anti-cancer drugs, could prove to be an effective means of preventing  development of or even reversing drug resistance.</span><br /></span></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Normally CpG islands are hypomethyated.</li><li>However, in cancer cells, CpG islands tends to be hypermethylated which then causes silencing of the underlying tumour suppressor gene.</li><li>Localized high-density concentrations of CpG repeat sequences between several hundred to a few thousand base pairs are noted to exist as islands in the promoter regions of many common genes, and in particular genes associated with tumor suppression. These islands are normally unmethylated but if these CpG islands become methylated due to some abnormal epigenetic mechanisms,  failure to transcribe the downstream tumour suppression gene occurs, causing silencing of that gene and eventually contributes to cancer.<br /></li><li><span>The majority of DNA methylation occurs in intragenic or intergenic regions. DNA methylation is commonly regarded as a silencing mechanism more difficult to reverse than covalent histone modifications.</span></li><li>Aberrant methylation has been reported in almost all cancer types and is considered a hallmark of cancer cells. At a genome-wide level, cancer cells display significant hypomethylation compared to normal cells. This is attributed to a loss of methylation in intergenic regions containing repetitive elements and is associated with chromosomal instability and activation of endogenous mobile DNA elements.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated. So enhancers can act on Igf2, which is a growth promoter.</li><li>In the maternal allele, the imprint control region is unmethylated. So CTCF can bind to the imprint control region and hence enhancers will bind to H19 and not to Igf2, resulting into normal cell.</li><li>In wilm's tumuor, there is loss of imprinting in the maternal allele so that CTCF cannot bind to the methylated imprint control region. Hence, Enhancers can bind to the Igf2 leading to its expression. Igf2 is a growth promoter and it is now expressed from both maternal s well as paternal allele resulting into Wilm's tumour, which is a childhood kidney tumour.</li><li>In wilm's tumuor, there is loss of imprinting in the maternal allele so that CTCF cannot bind to the methylated imprint control region.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine belongs to class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.</li><li>Decitabine, a nucleoside analogue, incorporates into DNA and inhibits DNA methyl transferase. Thus, it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyl transferase.</li><li><span><span>Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects following its conversion to decitabine triphosphate, where the drug directly incorporates into DNA and inhibits DNA methyltransferase, the enzyme that is responsible for methylating newly synthesized DNA in mammalian cells. This results in hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation (apoptosis). Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine that has been incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. </span><br /></span></li></ul></div>
