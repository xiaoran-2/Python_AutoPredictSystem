    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG island is the process to add methyl group to the C at CG rich regions of DNA thereby inactivating genes if such CpG island occur at promoters such genes. Silencing of genes via DNA methylation at CpG island can occur through either methylated CpG binding complexes (MCP proteins) which help condense the region or mutation of methylated C to T thereby preventing transcription factors to bind to promoters. In normal cells CpG island at promoters of active genes are generally not methylated for normal functioning of the cells. </p>
<p><span>Hyper-methylation of CpG rich promoters of genes (such as tumor suppressor and/or imprinted genes) cause silencing of such genes that are generally active in normal cells. Such hyper-methylation can contribute to uncontrolled division of cells.  </span></p>
<p>CpG at intergetic and repetitive regions are heavily methylated thereby contributing to condensing such regions and inactivating transposons for genomic stability in normal cells.</p>
<p><span>Hypo-methylation of genome wide repetitive elements, intergenic regions, imprinted genes or CpG poor promoters of genes (e.g. Mir21 gene) can activate such genes/regions which are generally silenced in normal cells. Hypo-methylation of genome wide repetitive elements can cause activation of transposons which can result in genomic instability by inserting copies in different places in genomes, including in genes (such as tumor suppressor) and thereby disrupting their function or activation/over-expression of genes such as growth promoting genes. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements in combination with their open chromatin can result in reciprocal translocations (via illegitimate recombinations), deletions and/or insertions. This can result in loss or disruption of promoter of normally active genes or activation/over-expression of inactive genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR of Igf2/H19 imprinted genes in the paternal chromosome is heavily methylated in normal cell thereby preventing CTCF insulator protein to bind this ICR. This disables insulation of Igf2 (growth promoting gene) from downstream enhancers and is therefore expressed; whereas DNA methylation spreads downstream to H19 promoter thereby deactivating H19 expression.</p>
<p>In maternal allele ICR of Igf2/H19 is not methylated which enables CTCF to bind to this ICR. This insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers keeping Igf2 silent in maternal allele. Instead, enhancers can act on H19 resulting in its expression in maternal allele.</p>
<p><span>In Wilm’s tumor ICR of both maternal and paternal allele of Igf2/H19 imprinted genes is methylated that disables CTCF from binding to ICR. This makes Igf2 available for expression via downstream enhancers in maternal and paternal alleles resulting in its over-expression in cancer cells. This over-expression of  growth promoting Igf2 is responsible for Wilm’s tumor (childhood kidney tumor). </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belong to a class of DNA-demethylating agents. They are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which are precursors of myelogenous leukaemia i.e. a cancer condition when blood stem cells give rise to abnormal white blood cells <span>called granulocytes.</span> </p>
<p><span>They are nucleoside analogues and hence get incorporated in the DNA during replication. When DNMTs bind to such DNA for methyl incorporation they get bound to these analogues irreversibly i.e. are locked thereby preventing DNMTs from methylating CG rich regions. </span></p>
<p>Being DNA-demethylating agent it treats myelodysplastic syndromes indicates that such tumors might be driven by CpG island hypermethylation such as promoters of tumor suppressor genes and by demethylating DNA it might be contributing to reactivation of tumor suppressor genes thereby treating such tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable i.e. passed on from parent cells to daughter cells and so on, modification in epigenome, such as DNA demethylation, can have long term effect that can inhibit cancer without requiring the need to kill tumor cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those when global removal of most of previous epigenetic marks while laying down (establishment) of new epigenetic marks takes place (Epigenetic reprogramming) .</p>
<p><span> Such sensitive periods are primarily during primordial germ cell development (primordial germ cell to mature gametes) and every development stage (early embryonic development i.e. pre-implantation to post implantation period).</span></p>
<p><span>Since such drugs can target normal cells other than targeted tumor cells, their usage during sensitive periods can bring changes in epigenetic marks in embryonic stem cells (early development) or germ line cells (primordial germ cell development) than can affect the human (from such embryo) or next generation (from germ cells) severely.</span></p></div>
