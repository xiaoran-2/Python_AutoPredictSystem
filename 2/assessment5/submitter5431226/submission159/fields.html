</p><p><span>Decitabine
is used in treating patients with MDS, a cancer in
which the bone marrow does not make enough healthy blood cells; in addition abnormal
cells are created in the bone marrow.  Decitabine
belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitor drugs called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.  Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation by
inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, a set of enzymes catalyzing the transfer of a
methyl group to DNA.  By inhibiting these
enzymes, decitabine reduces DNA methylation.  DNA methylation reduction reverses silencing of
genes controlling cell growth thereby restoring normal function to these genes. Cell growth then proceeds as expected.
By allowing cells to grow and differentiate normally, the body is better able
to make enough healthy cells in the bone marrow and/or blood (red and white blood
cells and platelets).  In addition, using
the same hypomethylation mechanism Decitabine is able to reactivate tumour
suppressor genes in tumour cells.  This inhibits
tumour growth. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">Normal cell DNA is hypomethylated at CpG islands but is hypemethylated at repetitive elements, regions between genes as well as gene. CpG islands are generally found at the promoters of tumour suppressor genes.  Thus CpG island hypomethylation allows for normal expression of tumour suppressor genes. Cancerous cells can then be eliminated.  When however CpG islands are hypermethylated tumour suppressor genes are silenced.  Keeping in mind that hypermethylation is mitotically heritable, cancer cells can proliferate since each cancer cell can silence tumour suppression gene expression. Thus the probability of cancer increases. Most of the genome is composed of intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  These are hypermethylated in normal cell DNA.  Genome wide hypermethylation maintains genomic stability by prohibiting illegitimate recombination between repeats as well as silencing activation of repeats and transpositions. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements has been observed in most tumours.  Hypomethylation implies that intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not densely packaged thus recombination can occur.  In addition repetitive elements can make copies of themselves and disrupt coding regions of genes as well as activate neighboring genes.  Thus in cancer cells one can observe additions to chromosomes, deletions of regions from chromosomes as well as reciprocal translocations, that is genetic instability.  Increased genomic instabiliyy leads to tissue specific cancers.  This has been observed in mouse models. In conclusion one can see that methylation disruption (whether this is hyper or hypo) in normal cells can be a triggering/contributing factor to cancer. As discussed in class cancer is created by multiple factors, genetic and epigenetic in nature.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region (ICR) in the H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated in the maternal allele but methylated in the paternal allele. Because the ICR is unmethylated in the maternal allele, an insulator protein, CTCF can be bound to it. CTCF prevents Igf2 enhancers, located downstream from the H19 promoter, from enhancing Igf2. Since the enhancers can not act on Igf2 they are now free to enhance H19.  In contrast the ICR is methylated in the paternal allele. CTCF can not bind to the ICR so the enhancers are free to act on (their primary preference) which is Igf2.  In addition, the ICR methylation spreads into H19 (promoter) which silences the gene.  Since a lot of imprinted genes are either growth promoting or growth suppressing, loss of imprinting implies lack of balance in cell growth (i.e. growth of abnornal versus normal cells) thus cancer. In patients with Wilm's tumor there is loss of imprinting: In this case both maternal and paternal alleles are hypermethylated.  This implies that in both alleles there is expression of Igf2 growth factor.  Thus there is unrestricted growth of cells. Wilm's tumor is observed in children 3 to 4 years of age but not in later years.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable epigenetic mechanism.  This means that alterations to cell type specific DNA methylation patterns, able to silence specific genes (without changing cell type coding sequence), are passed, during mitosis, to subsequent cell generations. DNA methylation pattern changes can be triggers and/or enablers for cancerous cell creation.  Sensitive periods are periods during which epigenetic state is actively modified: Epigenetic marks are removed in order for other epigenetic marks to be placed on the cell. Examples of such periods are 1) the period between primordial germ cell development all the way to production of mature eggs/sperms (i.e. from early adolescent to adulthood) ; 2) embryo pre-implantation and early post-implantation period.  Actively treating patients during such sensitive time periods would be inadvisable since methylation patterns created by drug treatments may be erased by the body thus making such treatments ineffective. In addition, it is not clear what the effects of drug based epigenetic reprogramming may be: Transgenerational consequences are possible. We have seen that changes to the environment have consequences on descendants of the individuals (epidemiological studies at Overkalix).  It is not unrealistic to expect analogous consequences when treated by drugs during sensitive periods.<br /><br /><br /></div>
