    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Mammalian genomes are
punctuated by DNA sequences containing a higher frequency of CpG dinucleotides
than you would expect by chance, known as CpG islands. Most, perhaps all, CpG
islands are sites of transcription initiation that act as genomic platforms for
regulating transcription at their associated promoters. In normal cells, CpG
islands are generally in a hypomethylated state. Many studies, however, have reported
a locus specific gain of DNA methylation at CpG islands in cancer cells, leading
to silencing of tumour suppressor genes. These abnormalities are thought to
contribute to uncontrolled proliferation of tumour cells and thus cancer development.</p>

<p><span>Other regions of the genome
such as repetitive elements and intergenic regions are found to be
hypermethylated and this seems to maintain genomic integrity. In particular,
“the genome defense hypothesis” proposes that the primary function of DNA
methylation of these repeats is to protect the genome from transposable
elements. Unlike normal cells, hypomethylation of these regions occurs to some
degree in all tumour types cell tested. So, the hypomethylation at intergenic intervals
and repetitive elements actually leads to genomic instability in the instances
of cancer (<i>e.g</i>. illegitimate deletions
or insertions, reciprocal translocations, and even duplication or loss of chromosomes).</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In the<i> H19/ Igf2 </i>cluster, methylation of imprint control region (ICR) on
paternal allele blocks the binding of the insulator protein CTCF, without this
insulator element, DNA methylation spreads to <i>H19</i> promoter to silence and downstream enhancers can access <i>Igf2</i> to activate. The ICR of the maternal
allele is unmethylated then the insulator protein CTCF binds the ICR and
insulates <i>Igf2</i> from downstream
enhancers that will act in <i>H19</i>. </span></p>

<span>The hypermethylation of ICR at the <i>H19/ Igf2 </i>cluster causes loss of
imprinting, the genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent-of-origin
specific expression, no longer show this imprinting expression but rather they
become express from both parental alleles. The overexpression of <i>Igf2 </i>is related to Wilm´s tumour. In
cancer the loss of imprinting at this particularly cluster result in upregulation
of <i>Igf2</i> which is an oncogene involved
in growth promoting of tumour cells.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a FDA approved
drug which belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi).  These drugs are nucleoside analogues that get
incorporated into the DNA, upon replication, irreversibly binding DNA
methyltransferase which cannot longer be released, and consequently the global level
of DNA methylation decreases. Although the mechanism of action is still
unclear, it is known that high doses of the drug display toxic effects, whereas
much lower doses can have an anti-neoplastic effect. Such effect can be
explained by the fact that DNA demethylation of hypermethylated tumour
suppressor genes result in activation of these genes and make the tumour cells
die or decrease proliferation.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes seem to be
mitotically heritable, such fact suggest that are passed on during cell
division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively removed
during epigenetic reprogramming. There are periods that seem to be more
sensitive to changes of the environment on the epigenetic control (sensitive
periods). The periods that are actually sensitive to epigenetic control are the
primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development both of them
are periods of active remodeling of the epigenome. Also during various
postnatal stages of development there are windows in time when specific tissues
will have very sensitive periods as well because of that particular organ
development. Therefore effects of this kind of treatment need to be consider at
this particular periods, such as the effects on germ cells development in
younger patients, especially in the germline of females.</p>
