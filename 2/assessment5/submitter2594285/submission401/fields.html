    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation
on CpG islands is a genetic mark that leads to silencing of the genes. In
cancer, some CpG islands appear hypermethylated. It seems that this can happen
because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so it is very effective in silencing
genes. Moreover, epimutations are rapidly selected so this fact makes the cell
very competitive. Hyperm ethylation
on CpG islands can lead to cancer by silencing tumor suppressor genes: they do
not express any longer and that makes more possible a cancer appearing. </p><p><span>It has been
recently discovered that hypermethylation at CpG island shores is also related
to gene expression and are also important in cancer.</span></p><p>Hypomethylation
of CpG islands can also lead to cancer if it comprises poor promoters of
oncogenes, producing overexpression of these genes.</p>

<p>But there
is also methylation in intergenic regions. This methylation is necessary for
the cell because it has a function of genomic stability. In cancer it has been
discovered that these intergenic regions are hypomethylated, and this fact
leads to genomic instability by three mechanisms: illegitimate recombination
between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of
cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal
cell, the parental allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated in the ICR.
This blocks CTCF binding, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence it and the result is that enhancers can access Igf2 to activate it and this gene is
expressed.</p>

<p>In the
maternal allele, ICR is not methylated, so CTCF, an insulator protein,
insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers and this gene is not expressed.</p>

<p>In general, the loss of
imprinting can lead to cancer because the genes that are involved in imprinting
culsters are usually related to growth, so overexpression of grow factors or
silencing of growth supressors can evolve into cancer.</p>

<p>In Wilm’s tumor,
for example, the imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster is lost. The maternal
allele is methylated and start behaving like the parental allele. The result is tha both
alleles express Igf2, a growth factor, and it overexpression leads to Wilm’s
tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is a DNA-demethylating drug sold as Dacogen by Eisai. This agent hypomethylates
DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. For this reason, decitabine has an
effect on cancer preventing the hypermethylation of CpG islands that lead to
cancer. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p><p>



</p><p>One example
is with GADD45A genes, wich
regulate apoptosis. This genes are inactivated in various types of cancer and
tumor cell lines. It has been proved that GADD45A was reexpressed by treatment with decitabine
and induced apoptosis of the cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>It has been shown that some epigenetic drugs (drugs
that alter epigenetic marks) can make some changes in the tumor that make it
more susceptible to chemotherapy in a lasting way. For example, researchers from
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine have shown that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine (a </span>DNA-demethylating agent) slowed tumour growth in some people
with advanced lung cancer. Moreover, other participants in this study who did
not show much response to the trial itself then went on to show an unexpectedly
good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them
next<span>. It is thought that this effect can
work for a long time because epigenetic
marks are mitotically heritable. </span></p>

<p><span>Probably this treatment shouldn’t been
used in what is called “sensitive periods”. During this periods epigenetic reprogramming
is made: marks are erased and remade. This periods are the early development and primordial germ cell
development. Under the use of this drugs epigenetic marks would
be altered and this could lead to serious disease.</span></p></div>
