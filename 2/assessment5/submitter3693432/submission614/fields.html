    <div class="field-value">In cancer there is a general trend for global hypomethylation and hypermethylation at CpG islands. Frequently, the state of the CpG islands are hypermethylation results in suppression of gene transcription, and this in turn may result in disregulation of tumor suppressors or activation of oncogenes. The alteration of intergenic DNA methylation may influence imprinting and/or heterocromatin state.  As with the CpG island methylation status, the alteration of methylation of DNA intergenic regions can affect gene transcription, DNA strand repair mechanisms, or even DNA mutations events.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The allele organization for H19/Igf2 is from 5' to 3' orientation: Igf2 gene ORF (open reading frame) then Imprint control Region (ICR) then H19 gene ORF and finally H19 enhancers. On the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated and preventing binding of a CTCF protein thus allowing transcription of the upstream Igf2 gene ORF. On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, the CTCF protein binds thus preventing the enhancers from activating transcription of the upstream Ifg2 gene. In Wilm's tumor the maternal allele is methylated, thus reverting the allele to the paternal state.  The result of both alleles in Wilm's tumor being methylated is that there will twice the dosage of Igf2 expressed.  Because Igf2 promotes cell growth, this double dose of Igf2 results in cellular hypertrophy or cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). The active ingredient in decitabine is a DNA analogue and is incorporated into the DNA in replicating cells.  When a DNMT encounters this decitabine analogue in the cell, the enzyme is inhibited and DNA methylation does not occur.  The inhibition of the DNMTs 'resets' or otherwise decreases methylation of the DNA allowing more normal cellular state to be established.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can lead to many altered epigenetic effects, for example altered imprinting, changes in X-inactivation, altered heterochromatin state, altered methylation of CpG islands (and associated changes in gene transcription).  A sensitive period relative to epigenomics is when the cell is mitotically or meiotically dividing.  The sensitive periods for epigenetics is during gametogenesis and during early embryo development. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because inhibiting DNA methylation during a meiotic stage of development would interfere with proper formation of gametes, and thus risk future embryos.  Further, inhibiting during early development when there are large scale mitotically active cells would interfere with normal developmental patterns.</div>
