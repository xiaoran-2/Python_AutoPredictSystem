    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA
methylation is a a silencing epigenetic mark and essential for life. It is the basis of different epigenetic
phenomenon such as imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation etc. It is important
for proper embryogenesis, development, genome stability and as a defense against expression of foreign DNA elements. CpG islands are sites of transcription initiation being rich in GC, and usually kept free of
methylation in active genes (highly expressed genes). <br /></p><p>DNA methylation patterns undergo complex changes
in cancer. These changes include loss of methylation at genome scale and/or a regional
gain of DNA methylation. In cancer cells, promoter associated CpG islands are hypermethylated leading to silencing of that particular gene. Hence through this phenomenon numerous genes are epigenetically
silenced in human cancer. In normal cells, tumor suppressor genes helps to avoid cancer, but in cancer cells genes
are permanently silenced leading to inactivation of tumor suppressor genes resulting in cancer. </p>

<p>In
highly expressed genes, intergenic methylation is a common mechanism at repetitive
sequences. It is useful to avoid transcription from alternative start
sites, stop antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to
replication timing. In cancer cells these intergenic regions are hypomehylated resulting in genome instability such as illegitimate recombination between
repeats, activation of repeats and transposons, activation of cryptic promoters
and disruption to neighboring genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Both maternal and parental genomes require for
normal development and maintained through a phenomenon called genome imprinting.
In genome imprinting a subset of genes involved in specific functions are
expressed from only one parental allele resulting in mono allelic gene
expression<span>. The human Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 (Igf2) is the
first imprinted gene to be identified as a growth-promoting gene. The
paternal expression of Igf2 is well established in many tissues where it found
active. In the upstream of Igf2 gene, there is another gene called as H19 gene.  These both genes are
imprinted in reciprocal matter where paternal chromosome expresses only Igf2
while maternal one transcribes H19 but not Igf2. It happens due to different
methylation pattern of parental and maternal alleles. The paternal H19 is
methylated in the promoter regions leading to inhibition of transcription of
paternal H19 while the maternal allele remained unmethylated and had open
chromatin structure. So </span><i>H19</i><span> methylation on the
paternal allele was the key to determine silencing of <i>H19</i> and <i>Igf2</i>
activation and its loss results in Wilms’ tumor. In fact, H19 acts as tumor
suppressor or oncogene. So basically methylation pattern of Igf2 and H19 is
altered in Wilms’ tumor. </span>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine
is a DNA methylating agent that modify DNA by adding methyl group on
nucleotides and is able to induce chromatin
condensation. Addition of methyl group and chromatin condensation result in hypermethylated genes  leading to impairment of active gene transcription. Hence
Decitabine is an important epigenetic drug that can regulate gene expression.
Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and incorporated into DNA
during cell replication to inhibit enzymatic activity of DNA
methyltransferases. Through these characteristics "Decitabine" is able to
re-induce silenced cancer suppressor genes in tumor cells whose job to stop the
uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">It is because epigenetic changes (e.g DNA
methylation) are mitotically inheritable and passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter
cells until these are completely removed. Yes there are periods of development
where we have to avoid treating patients with such drugs. Clearing and
resetting of epigenetic marks happened during primordial germ cell development and
early embryonic development. Hence these periods called as sensitive periods. If
the patients were treated with epigenetic drugs during these periods then it
can lead abnormal genetic regulation throughout generations.
