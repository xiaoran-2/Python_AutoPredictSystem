    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA
methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting,
X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin.Generally, DNA
methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression.
Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters. They
have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of
their activity state. Normal cells are generally methylated in CpG islands
which allow activation of gene expression.</p>

<p>In cancer
cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated. And it is an alternative to genetic
mutation to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer, by hypermethylation of
their promoter CpG islands.</p>

<p>Since DNA
methylation is mitiotically heritable, it is a very effective way of silencing
tumour suppressor genes. And over a period of time, cells with distrupted DNA
methylation has advantage of dividing rapidly.</p>

<p>Normal cells
are generally hypermethylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements,
which normally allows the area to densely packed into hetrochromatin and
heprevents recombination </p>

<p>In cancer
cells, they have hypomethylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements
which can cause genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and
imprinted genes. And it can lead to illegimate recombination of repeats,
activation of repeats and transpositions, activation of cryptic promoters and
disruption to neighboring genes. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can lead
to activation of oncogenes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint
control region is unmethylated on maternal allele. And it is bound by CTCF, and
CTCF is an insulator protein which prevents enhancers to bind to IgF2. There is
a long noncoding RNA that's being produced on maternal allele called H19.Because
CTCF is insulating IgF2, these enhancers act on H19 and enhance H19 expression.
So IgF2 is not expressesd from maternal allele</p>

<p>On the paternal
allele when this imprint control region is methlyated, CTCF can now no longer
insulate then the enhancers are indeed free to act on Igf2. And promote Igf2's
expression from the paternal allele. And therefore, Igf2 is expressed only from
the paternal allele and not the maternal allele. So this is how we end up with
paternally imprinted expression of Igf2. </p>

<p>The most
common embryonic or childhood tumour is known as Wilms tumor which is found in
the kidney. So this loss of imprinting and overexpression of growth promoting
genes </p>

<p><span> Igf2 promotes growth, it's an oncogene. So In
the case of loss of imprinting, both alleles behave like the paternal allele
and end up having too much Igf2, the growth promoting gene, leading to cancer.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is  a DNA
methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It is a drug targeting  enzymatic epigenic regulators since enzymes
are most readily targeted with small molecule inhibitor.<b></b></p>

<p>They are neucleoside analogues  and irreversibly binds to DNMT after they are
incorporated into DNA and inhibits DNA methylation. Their action is replication
dependent so cancer cells, which are rapidly dividing, will be affected most. </p>

<p>In hemateological malignancies, they are dependent on
tumour suppressor genes hypermethylation, so Decitabine counteract this by
inhibiting DNMT and allowing the expression of tumour suppressor genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation, which is one of the epigenetic modification is mitotically inheritable. So if cells where their DNA methylation pattern is effected by epigenetic drugs  will continue to pass this epigenic alteration to daughter cells, even after the period of drug treatment.<br />Sensitive period are  periods when genome wide clearing and resetting of epigenic marks taking place.<br />These are pre implantation period and germ cell development period since they require clearing  and resetting of epigenic marks from both parents alleles.<br />It should be avoided to treat patients with such drugs during sensitive period because during this time, the genome is relatively susceptible to epigenic modification and will produce long lasting effect. If can effect growth and development of embryo and in young adults, germ cell development will be affected and can lead to transgeneration disorders.<br /></div>
