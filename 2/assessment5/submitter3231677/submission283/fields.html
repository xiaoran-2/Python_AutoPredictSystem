    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the basis of many different epigenetic phenomena. In normal cells, the CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation, but they tend to be hypermethylated in cancer cells. This causes the silencing of the tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells. In this way, disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer. <br /><br />Intergenic methylation can be found at repetitive sequences in normal cells. However, in cancer cells, these regions tend to be hypomethylated, causing genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Use the disruption of imprinting in the H19/Igf2 cluster as an example. In the paternal allele of a normal cell, the imprinting control region is methylated so that CTCF cannot bind to this allele. The H19 gene is also methylated and therefore it won't be expressed. In this case, the enhancers can act on the Igf2 gene, so Igf2 is expressed. In the maternal allele of a normal cell, Neither the imprinting control region nor the H19 gene is methylated. Therefore, CTCF can bind on the imprinting control region and act as an insulator. In this case, the enhancers can only act on the H19 gene. Igf2 is not expressed.<br /><br />In cancer cells, both the paternal and the maternal alleles tend to be hypermethylated or hypomethylated simultaneously. In the case of H19/Igf2 cluster, when the imprinting control regions in both alleles are methylated, there is a double dose of Igf2 expression. Igf2 is growth promoting, and this leads to the Wilm's tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dicitabine is a type of DNA-demethylating agent. As the name suggests, it can demethylate some regions in the human DNA. We know that some of the tumor suppressor genes are silenced through DNA methylation in the cancer cells. If these regions are demethylated with the help of Dicitabine, then the tumor suppressor genes can be expressed. In that way, the number of fast-growing cells will be reduced. This is a possible anti-tumor effect of this drug.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a common type of epigenetic modification. It is mitotically heritable. Thus, altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. The period from primordial germ cell development to the production of mature gametes is one sensitive period. Another sensitive period is from pre-implantation to early post-implantation period. Generally, sensitive periods are periods of active remodeling of the epigenome.<br /><br />Since the epigenetic marks are actively remodeled in these sensitive periods, it's hard to predict the effect of epigenetic modifiers. Moreover, if deleterious changes occur, these changes can still be inherited though mitosis. Therefore, treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.</div>
