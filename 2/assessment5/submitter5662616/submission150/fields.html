    <div class="field-value">The onset of cancer is apparently linked to major shifts in the cell's methylation status (a loss of methylation genome-wide, and a gain thereof in specific regions). <br /><br />CpG islands are chromosomal regions with a high frequency of the CpG motif. Such islands are typically 300-3000 base pairs long, and they occur in a large amount of mammalian promoter sequences. About 70-80% of the CpG motifs in the mammalian genome (in somatic cells) is methylated at the C5 position of the cytosine base. Such a methylation of CpG sites within the promoters of genes can lead to their silencing, (for example the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. If such a promoter is hypermethylated, the occurrence of cancer is favorised. On the other hand, these CpG islands can in certain instances (e.g. in the promoter of oncogenes) be hypomethylated, causing the activation of the expression of these genes, which again drives the onset of cancer. <br /><br />Intergenic regions  are the non-coding stretches of DNA between genes. Repetitive elements are DNA stretches which contains highly repeated short motifs. These repeats, such as the long term repeats flanking integrated transposon DNA, In both cases, their existence and methylation pattern is hypothesized to stabilise genome integrity. When these zones lose their methylation to a certain degree, this causes instabilities in the cell's genome, leading to increased numbers of mutations and translocations. If these affect genes linked to growth control, this may again facilitate the onset of cancer. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The<em> IGF2</em>-gene codes for the insulin growth factor, a proteinaceous growth regulating hormone. In the DNA, the gene is closely linked to the <em>H19 </em>gene (coding for a long non-coding RNA). In the maternal allele, the H19 promoter, which is situated downstream from <em>Igf2 </em>and (evidently) upstream from <em>H19</em>, is unmethylated and binds the insulator protein CTCF. This blocks the interaction between the <em>Igf2 </em>gene and the enhancer proteins, the genes of which lie even further downstream. These enhancers fail therefore to bind <em>Igf2 </em>and to enhance cellular growth.  In the paternal allele, however, the <em>H19 </em>promoter and gene are methylated, which makes it possible for the enhancer proteins to activate and enhance <em>Igf2 </em>expression. In the case of Wilm's tumour, the promoter of H19 maternal allele is methylated as well. The consequence is, that we see now activation of both <em>Igf2 </em>alleles, an overproduction of the insulin growth factor, and therefore an overstimulation of growth of the affected cell. This leads to the formation of at least a hyperplasia and maybe in time a neoplasic tumour.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent acting by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 (an enzyme which methylates hemimethylated CpG dinucleotides). It will therefore block further methylation activity, leading to hypomethylated DNA (especially of the CpG islands). This will reverse the silencing of anticancer genes (tumour suppressing genes) due to hypermethylation of CpG motifs. <br /><br />Because the drug is only effective in inhibiting DNA methylation in freshly made copies (of which one strand still carries the epigenetic methyl group of the mother cell), the decitabine will work best in actively growing cells (luckily, such as cancer cells). <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As an epigenetic mark, DNA methylation can be inherited by the daughter cells after cell division. As long as there is no new event erasing all previous marks, the individual carrying the marks is therefore relatively safe. Of course, there are sensitive periods, during which cells go through an epigenetically sensitive phase: a phase during which epigenetic marks are being removed and redefined. There are two such phases: during early embryogenic development (between 0.5 and 8.5 days), and during primordial germ cell development. Influencing these periods of epigenetic imprinting with drugs will irreversibly harm the normal development, and therefore either harm the developing fetus, or diminish the patient's fertility. <br /></div>
