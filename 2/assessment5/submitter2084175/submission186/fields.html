    <h1>Submission 186 from Anon (session_user_id: a95683ddf66267d9d71c8f2b063ddae38045c4df)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is considered a DNA-demethylating agent/anti-cancer/chemotherapy drug, used to treat <br />myelodysplastic syndromes, which are the <span>the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. <br />DNA </span>methylation <span>can result in the blockage of the activity of suppressor genes that regulate cell division and growth.<br /></span>When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing and/<span>or promoting cancer.<br /></span>Decitabine <span>demethylizes or interferes  with the methylation of DNA. <br /></span><span> By the process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.<br /></span>Decitabine is in a category of chemotherapy called anti-metabolites, which are very similar to normal substances within a cell.<br /><span>When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</span><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In a normal cell you find that the CpG islands are hypomethylated, and the intergenic</div><div>regions, introns and repetitive elements are hypermethylated.  In a cancer cell, the process is reversed. <br />CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated, and<div>the intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. <br />For the CpG islands, this leads to problems as tumor</div><div>suppressor genes may become silenced, allowing the cell to divide more rapidly and out-compete its</div><div>neighboring cells, increasing the likelihood of tumor development.<br />Also, within the intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements, normal hypermethylation at<div>these sites is associated with greater genomic stability, so hypomethylation during cancer leads</div><div>to copying errors such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the</div><div>chromosomes</div><br /></div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In a cell around the H19/Igf2 locus we ordinarily see the methylation of the paternal allele at the</div><div>ICR, and no methylation on the maternal allele. The CTCF complex binds to the allele on the</div><div>maternal strand and the downstream enhancers act on H19 as a result. The CTCF complex</div><div>does not bind to the paternal allele due to  methyl marks, which leads to silencing of the H19</div><div>gene as the enhancers instead drive expression of Igf2. Thus, in a regular cell you observe a</div><div>normal dose of both H19 from maternal strand, and Igf2 from paternal strand. However, when</div><div>this ICR becomes hypermethylated, both strands appear to be of paternal origin and get</div><div>expressed as such.  <br />The system gets twice the amount of growth­-promoting Igf2 and no dosage of  H19. <br />This is associated with Wilm's tumor.<br />Loss of imprinting of the IGF2<span> gene has been identified in several types of cancer known as embryonal tumors. These tumors include a rare form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor, a cancer of muscle tissue called rhabdomyosarcoma, and a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma.</span><br /><br /><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dr Stephen Baylin's research has shown that the combination of <span>a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumor growth in some people with advanced lung cancer.<br />These epigenetic drugs showed success  </span><span>against a solid tumor, rather than a leukemia or a lymphoma, and the participants that did not show much of a response to the trial, had an unexpected positive reaction/results  once they started a chemotherapy drug protocol.<br />Epigenetic changes are passed down in the process of cell division from granddaughter and daughter cells until they are completely erased and once erased they will never return again. This process can occur during cell division due to transcription factors.<br />This new and promising form of epigenetic  therapy can possibly eliminate the spread of cancer cells without killing healthy cells.<br />The Sensitive period is </span><span>treating </span>drug-resistant cells with epigenetic drugs that could restore the sensitivity to anticancer drugs by reactivating previously silenced genes.  <br />Critical/sensitive periods are the time when extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs.<br /><div>It would be inadvisable to prescribe these treatments to pregnant mothers especially a few months before conception as a lot of reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the formation of gametes both male and female.</div><span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> </span></div>
