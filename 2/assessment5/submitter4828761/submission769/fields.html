    <h1>Submission 769 from Anon (session_user_id: bdbf9e4ad8ca9b6cd3770b06f1e65bd84e9ab1a4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the market, we can find inhibitors of DNA-methyltransferases (DNMT), for example: decitabine, called Dacogen ( produced by japanesse company Eisai). </p><p>Decitabine acts as DNA-demethylating agent. It is able to decrease methylation level of DNA. It is a nucleoside analogue. After incorporation into DNA, decitabine irreversibly binds DNMTs. This is useful in case of the hypermethylated tumor-suppressor genes which silencing is often evident in cancer cells, or in the case of genes involved in an epigenetic regulation that are less active due to their hypermethylation. Mechanism of its action is still unclear.</p><p>Based on the dr Baylin's research, a combination of DNA-demethylating agents and histone-deacetylase inhibitors should decrease, even stop, solid tumor growth via the change of tumor's epigenetic pattern. These drugs also enhance the efficiency of the routine chemotherapeutic drugs and somehow facilitate the penetration of therapeutics into the solid tumors.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Nearly 60 % of genes contain CpG island in their promoters. Often, they are a part of promoters of the housekeeping genes and tumor supressor genes (genes controlling cell division and growth), genes which are important in regulation of all processes in cell. Cancer as complex disease causes many gene breakages and disturb many regulatory pathways. In normal cells, CpG-islands are NOT methylated. CpG islands can be found hypermethylated in tumour cells. Ratio of 5mC and CpG-islands methylation should tell us more about the stage of tumorogenesis (hyperplasia, neoplasia, invasion). So, hypermethylation increases with tumourogenicity. A change of the epigenetic alteration in CpG-island can lead to misexpression of particular gene and loss of function due to silencing of this gene or loss of imprinting (silenced or expressed from both alelles). </p><p>In normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements (REs) are highly methylated through all lifespan. They do not undergo epigenetic reprogramming, to keep all REs in silent state and avoid genetical damages caused by their activation. In case of cancer, hypomethylation leads to the activation of repets and transposable elements (TEs). Hypomethylation occurs early in tumorogenesis. Consequence of the activation is genome instability (reciprocal translocations, deletions, insertions, illegitimate recombinations). Insertions of active TEs into the new locus in DNA should cause loss of function of tumor suppressor gene or gain of function (switch on) of oncogene (gene supporting growth of cell). </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele of H19 has hypermethylated promoter but imprinted control region (ICR) is free of insulator CTCF protein, thus IgF2 is expressed (activated by enhancers). (Father: no CFCT in ICR = DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence H19 transcription and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate its transcription). In case of mother, lncRNA H19 is expressed because ICR is occupied by CTCF protein. CTCF protein blocks enhancers to activate Igf2 so they act on H19 site and activate expression of lncRNA H19. </p><p>In Wilm's tumour, maternal alelle turns to paternal epigenetic pattern. Both maternal and paternal lncRNA H19 promoters are hypermethylated. H19 transcription is silenced. Vice-versa, both Igf2 alelles are active and highly transcribed. </p><p>Igf2 is an oncogene (growth promoter).  The result of wrong imprinting leads to upregulation of Igr2. High amount of Igf2 transcripts causes increased cell growth. This kind of cancer occurs in children, in adults it was not detected. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike other forms of gene regulation, epigenetic changes (DNA methylation) are mitotically inherited (via methyltransferases establishing the epigenetic marks during cell division). If epigenetic marks are once erased they can not return. Therapeutic changes in methylation pattern pass on the next generation of daughter cells. This could be a way to stop tumor growth. Every class of epigenetic regulators were found to be mutated in some type of cancer. This leads to broad range of phenotypes and different effects on function ( loss or gain).</p><p>Changes in DNA methylation can lead to changes in gene expression, switch off/on of particular genes or can influence binding of proteins that co-operate on the chromatine acetylation/methylation. </p><p>Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming (germ cell development and early stage development) when epigenetic marks are firstly erased and then de-novo established. We need to pay attention to younger patients because epigenetic drugs have an effect on germ cells that can be transmitted to next generation. Even if patient is not in sensitive periods, every cell should be potentially effected by these drugs. </p></div>
