    <div class="field-value"><p>The modification of the
C5 position of the cytosine base is found in approximately 70–80% of CpG
dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells. DNA methylation is the basis for different
epigenetic phenomena. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely
correlates with gene expression. Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in
about 60% of promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually
kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. Ther integenic regions are usually methylated, repetitive elemnts are usuallly methylated.</p>

<p>In cancer cells promoter
CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the
underlying gene. Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such
as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and
SINEs in human DNA. </p>

<p>The epigenome of cancer cells displays
numerous alterations in comparison to the epigenome of their normal
counterpart. Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a
regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability
and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand
silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA
repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands. Unusually high
frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites was termed CIMP (for CpG island
methylator phenotype)</p>

<p>Normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements
previene Illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and
transposition, activatin of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring
genes.<br /></p>

<p>The
DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in
cancer: by driver supressor hypermetilation or chromosomal instability </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Using
the example H19/Igf2, i<span>n
normal human tissues only the paternal <i>IGF2 </i>allele is transcribed; and its
imprinting is regulated by at least two differentially methylated regions
(DMRs): one is located upstream of the three <i>IGF2 </i>promoters that are subject to
imprinting (</span><i>IGF2</i><i> </i>DMR), and the other is located
upstream of the neighboring non-coding <i>H19</i><i> </i>gene
(<i>H19</i><i> </i>DMR). The latter region is part of
the imprinting control region (ICR) which harbors binding sites for the zinc
finger protein CTCF. </p>

<p>Loss of imprinting (LOI) of the IGF2 gene (which
encodes insulin-like growth factor II) is the most common genetic or epigenetic
alteration in Wilms tumor; LOI involves aberrant activation of the normally
repressed maternally inherited allele.<br /></p>

<p><span>Nearly
every gene that is imprinted has been implicated as a regulator of embryonic, chorionic
or adult growth or metabolism. Igf2 is involved in three stages. Circulating Igf2
ligand has been show to regulate crosstalk between the WNT and Igf1R ways, which
can lead to activation of either the phosphoinositide  3 kinase AKT or Ras-MAPK (mitogen activated
protein kinase) pathway that control metabolism, grow, differentiation, and
apoptosis. LOI of Igf2 in Wilms tumor is considered the most common epigenetic or
genetic aberration in these tissue.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA
methylation is laid down by de novo methyltransferases, DNMT 3 in mammals.
DNA methylation is maintened by DNMT1 Decitabine
is an approved drug or the FDA. It is a DNMT inhibitor. It’s a nuncleoside
analogue, irreversible bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA,
therefore replication dependent. Cancer cells often have abnormal
hypermethylation and silencing of tumor suppressor genes<a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a> and of genes
that support chemotherapy cytotoxicity<a></a><a></a>. If DNA hypermethylation
might play a role in resistance, then it follows that agents that reduce DNA
methylation might sensitize cells to chemotherapy. The DNA demethylating agent
decitabine reversed folate binding protein downregulation in
cisplatin-resistant cells<a></a>, augmented cellular uptake of
methotrexate and carboplatin<a></a>, and reversed resistance to
various chemotherapy<a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a> or targeted agents<a></a> by
upregulating expression of proapoptotic factors<a></a><a></a><a></a>
and by other mechanisms<a></a>. DNA methylation also protected
the anti-apoptotic factor survivin from repression by p53, and decitabine
reversed this, permitting survivin repression by p5<a></a>3. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the
experiment of Dr Bayling results obtained deferred mode because there is a lag
time for the epigenetic change extends to daughter cells and these chemotherapeutic
drugs sensitize.</p>

<p>Changes
in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA
methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of
tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor
suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by
hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands. </p>

<p>Although
DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark, which is passed on to
subsequent cell generations, reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during
gametogenesis and after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of
somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells.</p>

<p><span>It
would therefore be unwise treatment epigenetic drug treatment in adolescent
patients or pregnant</span></p></div>
