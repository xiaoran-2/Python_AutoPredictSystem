    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an important process and sometimes referred to as epigenetic mark. DNA methylation addition of a methyl group at cytosines, are maintained through cell division, and happen specifically at cytosine followed by guanine groups, or CpG dinucleotides (symmetrical and is maintained through cell division[mitotic memory]). The DNA methylation mark at CpG dinucleotides is a stable epigenetic mark and are typically found in CpG islands at the promoters of genes. The presence of methylated CpG islands is synonymous with silencing of the gene. The removal of a silencing mark enables the activation of a gene. <br /><br />Cancer, although a complicated biological process, can be consider the interplay between oncogenes (cell replication triggers) and tumor suppressors. Several other factors influence the evolution of cancer in a system-biological perspective but activating oncogenes and deactivating tumor suppressors results in abnormal growth of cells leading to cancer. This can be accomplished genetically and/or epigenetically. <br /><br />Cancer cells are typically found with hypermethylation at CpG islands with hypomethylation at repetitive elements of the genome, as well as intergenic regions, and at the introns of genes. Normal cells have the exact opposite with hypomethylation of the genes (allowing expression) and hypermethylation of repetitive elements, intergenic regions, and introns. Interestingly, the hypermethylation of the CpG islands at the promotor of the genes which are responsible for tumor suppression, leading to the inactivation of this response and enabling tumor growth without regulation (RB, MLH1, BRAC1, MGMT).  <br /><br />Genome-wide hypomethylation is one of the earliest epigenetic abnormalities, occurs to some degree in all tested tumors, and occurs most frequently at intergenic intervals and repeats. It leads to instability, resulting in deletion, reciprocal translocations, and insertions. Without methylation in these regions, genomic instability results leading to the onset of cancer. <br /><br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of imprinting is another very common observable of cancer cells. Genes that should be expressing mono-allelelic parent of origin specific expressions no longer observable, but one sees either both parent's allleles being expressed or silenced. One of the issues with this type of silencing or expression is that many of the imprinted genes are responsible for growth (either growth promoting or suppressing involving hypermethylation or hypomethylation). <br /><br />Paternal allele is hypermethylated and the enhancers can act on igf2, and igf2 is expressed in the paternal allele. <br /><br />Maternal allele is unmethylated, with a binding of CTCF, which means that the enhancers act of the H19 with the igf2 not expressed on the maternal allele.<br /><br />With loss of imprinting, there is hypermethylation of the maternal allele, resulting in the expression of igf2. <br /><br />Now there is twice the expression of igf2 which is a growth promoting and is associated with Wilm's tumor which is a childhood kidney tumor. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent (hypomethylating agent) and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome. This syndrome represents a class of conditions where particular blood cells are dysfunctional and for acute myeloid leukemia (bone marrow disease). The effect of Decitabine is to inhibit DNA methyltransferase stopping the generation of abnormal cells. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dr. Baylin's results and conclusions represent a new paradigm for the treatment of cancers. Using  combination of histone-deacetylase and azacitidine (DNA hypomethylating agent), they were slowed tumor solid growth. <br /><br />DNA methylation is mitotically heritable which means that the as the cells reproduce, the subsequent generation of daughter cells have either silenced or expressed genes based upon the location and type of methylation. <br /><br />Using  combination of treatments, the tumor cell growth was retarded. Coupled with traditional chemotherapies, his patients showed unexpectedly good reactions to the therapy. From Dr. Baylin's research and comments it would suggested that his epigenetic drugs altered the patient's tumor cells in a lasting way and made them more susceptible to chemotherapy. <br /><br />Although this treatment looks very promising, one of the difficulties with DNA methylation is that there are times that this treatment would be unadvisable. Sensitive periods involving epigenetic reprogramming such as in germ cells or early development can be greatly influenced by epigenetic therapies that alter the methylation of cells. Treatment of pregnant women during these times could results in several disorders (germ cell tumors, placenta insufficiency, and early embryonic lethality).  <br /><br />Many disorders are also possible if epigenetic control/programming is modified during these sensitive times. </div>
