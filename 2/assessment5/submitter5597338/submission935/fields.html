    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">1. CpG islands are usually unmethylated in normal cells while tumor suppressor genes are activated.

2. There’s hypermethylation in CpG islands, CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes, but there’s also hypomethylation in CpG poor promoters.

3. Hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes would inactivate them, while hypomethylation at CpG poor promoters would activate oncogenes.

4. There’s hypermethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells.

5. But there’s hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells.

6. Methylation abnormality in intergenic regions and repetitive elements would cause genomic instability including illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and  activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes.The ICR and H19 of paternal allele are in hypermethylation, resulting in silence of Igf2.

2. The ICR and H19 of paternal allele are in hypomethylation, resulting in expression of Igf2.

3. ICR and H19 of both alleles are in hypermethylation in Wilm’s tumor cells, which would cause the overexpression of Igf2 and skimpy expression of H19.

4. The Igf2 is expressed with double doze, but it’s growth promoting. Hence, this would contribute to cancer.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. Decitabine is one of DNA-demethylating agents.
2. Sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, Decitabine are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.
3. As a hypomethylating agent, Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, which would prohibit abnormality of methylation, a biomarker of tumour. And hence, Decitabine does have some anti-tumour effect.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. As is known, DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Once one methylated site is demethylated, the site at two daughter chromosomes during mitosis would be also demethlated, which couldn’t guide DNMT1 to methylate the complementary site at the other strand in the daughter chromosome. So once the DNA methylation is altered by drugs, it would last beyond the period of drug treatment. 

2. Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming including early development and PGC and GC development, which are easily influenced by the environment.

3. Sensitive periods of development contain early development and PGC and GC development when the epigenome is reprogrammed.

4. Treatments during sensitive periods are likely to disrupt the epigenome. For example, Decitabine would disrupt the reestablishment of DNA methylation in the primordial germ cells of the fetus if this drug is taken in by the pregnant woman. Therefore, such drugs would be strongly inadviseable during sensitive periods.
