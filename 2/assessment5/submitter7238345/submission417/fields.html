    <div class="field-value"><p>Generally, CpG islands are hypomethylated in
normal cells. Those hypomethylations allow the DNA to adopt the euchromatin
form and to promote the gene expression. In contrast, the CpG islands are
usually methylated in cancer cells. By methylating those regions of the
tumour suppressor genes, the cell can avoid to be repressed by its own
mechanism and it can continue proliferating faster than usual. Anyway,
different states of methylation on those regions are related with different
states of cancer as hyperplasic, neoplasia or metastasis. This kind of tumorigenesis
is very efficient because it’s mitotically heritable, which means that the cell
is able to maintain methylations after division. In conclusion, DNA
methylations on CpG islands contributes to cancer development because this way
the cell is able to silence the anti-tumour genes by packaging the DNA. </p><span>

The
repetitive elements and intergenic regions use to remain methylated in normal
cells, but in cancer cells those sites of DNA are more likely to be
hypomethylated. There are two ways of decreasing the level of methylations in
DNA. There can be a recruitment of a DNA methyltransferase, which is able to
add or remove DNA methylations. Secondly, there can also be a loss of
methylations due to ageing. Methylations of repetitive elements, intergenic and
also intragenic regions (as introns) contribute to maintain the genomic
stability. Another example of this mechanism are CpG island shores. In normal
cells those sites are found hypermethylated producing a normal expression of
genes, but in cancer those are highly unmethylated producing an overexpression
of oncogenes.   Hypomethylations in these
regions induce DNA to act like euchromatin and when recombination occurs, it
can derive in illegitimate recombination, deletions or insertions at the
chromosomes. This produces genomic instability that generally derives in
cancer.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 is a cluster that regulates the
expression of the H19 and the Igf2 genes. In healthy cells, the maternal allele
is the only one that expresses H19 and the paternal is the one that expresses
the Igf2 growth factor causing the phenomenon known as imprinting. This is due
to the methylation of the H19 gene in the paternal allele but not in the
maternal allele. These methylations guards against the union of CTCF to a
specific region of DNA because it is packaged. Therefore, the enhancers
activate only the expression of Igf2. In the maternal allele hypomethylations
allows CTCF to interact with DNA expressing only the H19 gene. </p><p>The Wilm’s
tumour is associated with methylation of both alleles in this region. These
hypomethylations on the H19 gene provides the cell with an overdose of the
Igf2, because CTCF is unable to bind DNA. The state of hypermethylation is
noticeable on a very premature stage of the cancer, which helps in the
treatment of the disease before it is too late. It is important to control the
expression of the different growth factors because an excess could produce
cancer, just like in Wilm’s tumour. </p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor approved by the Food and Drugs
Administration for use in myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute
myeloid leukaemia (AML). </p>

<p>This
drug is a nucleoside analogue incorporated into the DNA upon replication. When
the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) comes to bind this nucleotide to then copy the
methylation to the daughter strand, this methyltransferase is irreversibly bound
and can not be released. </p>

<p>It is
known that heavy CpG island hypermethylation has a poor prognostic outcome for
myelodysplastic syndrome. It seems that low doses of DNMTi can produce a great
anti-neoplastic effect in this syndrome by demethylating this DNA region. In
resume, Decitabine kills the tumour cells that seem to be causing undesired DNA
methylation.</p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It has been found that a combination of an HDACi and a DNMTi slowed
tumour growth in some patients with lung cancer. Some of the patients who did
not response to this drug combination showed then an unexpectedly good reaction
to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs. </p>

<p>Therefore, DNA methylation alterations had enduring effects on the epigenome.
This is possible because epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable; they are
passed on during cell division until they are actively erased.</p>

<p>A sensitive period is referred to the times when there is active
epigenetic reprogramming. In these periods there is an intense removal and
laying down of epigenetic marks at different places of the genome. Moreover,
they seem to be most sensitive to changes in the environment.</p>

<p>There are three main sensitive periods of development. The first one
starts at primordial germ cell development all the way through to the
production of mature eggs and sperm. The other two are the pre-implantation and
the early post-implantation periods.</p>

<p>The treatment of patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable
because it includes stages under strong epigenetic control. Any change during
these periods would probably have severe aberrations that could affect the
health and viability of the embryo.</p><span>
