    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands normally plays a role in establishing and maintaining the epigenetic state in cells. This function includes a role in genetic imprinting, the random x-inactivation in females, and in the formation of heterochromatin. DNA methylation has an inverse correlation with the expression of genes, so that if the promoter is heavily methylated, the gene is not likely to be expressed, whereas an unmethylated promoter tends to drive expression of the gene. However, this is only one of the mechanisms by which promoter regions are regulated, so the methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions tends to be low, with regulation controlled by other factors.<br /><br />In the cancerous state, DNA methylation at CpG islands is disrupted, and this tends to be by regional hypermethylation, with a genome-wide loss of methylation.<br /><br />Hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of genes, leads to suppression of gene expression. If this gene product is involved in growth suppression, then loss of expression, may lead to overgrowth of that cell lineage, especially is further aberrant gene expression is found in factors affecting the proliferation of the cell. Loss of methylation in the rest of the genome can lead to instability in other areas, and increased expression of proto-oncogenes.<br /><br />Intergenic regions contain repetitive elements, such as satellite repeats, and remnants of retroviral insertions. These region tend to be methylated in order to suppress their expression, which could lead to aberrant transcription. But also, methylation of these regions marks them as unexpressed, so means that they would usually be marked as heterochromatin and be packaged down to avoid expression.<br /><br />In the cancerous state, hypomethylation may be observed in these intergenic regions, resulting in genomic instability, deletions, insertions, and translocations between chromosomes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, or Dacogen, is a DNA-demethylating agent. It acts to reduce the methylation of DNA in cells, therefore reducing aberrant methylation related suppression of genes.<br /><br />The anti-tumour effect is related to tumours that arise from the hypermethylation of genes involved in tumour suppression. If this methylation is removed, then transcription is more likely to occur, and overproliferation of the cells is reduced.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Usually, during cell division, the methylation marks are transferred onto the new daughter cells by DNA Methyltransferase, DNMT. DNMT recognises methylated cytosine residues in the original strand, and replicates these marks in the daughter strand. If the hypermethylated residues are absent due to the use of drugs to alter the state of DNA methylation in the cell, then they will not be transferred onto the new strand, and so have an enduring effect on the epigenome.<br /><br />A sensitive period for DNA methylation relates to any period where the DNA methylation marks are removed and reset.<br /><br />Sensitive periods for DNA methylation are during early embryo development, where genes are actively demethylated to remove the methylation marks, and also during primordial germ cell development, when programming occurs to imprint the genes as paternally or maternally inherited.<br /><br />Treating patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable, as it may adversely affect the epigenome. If the DNA methylation is not laid down appropriately during this time, then this can have a negative effect on lots of genes that are paternally or maternally inherited, and also lead to inappropriate activation of genes due to aberrant gene silencing or activation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele of the ICR for the H19/IGF2 cluster is methylated, so CTCF can not bind. In this case, the enhancers act on IGF2 and cause it to be expressed. Conversely, on the maternally inherited copy of this gene, the ICR is unmethylated, and so CTCF is able to bind and prevent the enhancers from promoting IGF2 expression.<br /><br />In WIlm's tumour, hypermethylation is found at the ICR on the maternal allele.<br /><br />In cancer, hypermethylation at the ICR can be found on the maternal allele, removing the imprinting marks, which should cause this allele to not be expressed, and leading to expression of IGF2 from the maternal allele as well as the paternal allele. An excess of growth factor (twice that what is usually found) will add to the cancerous phenotype by promoting growth beyond normal.</div>
