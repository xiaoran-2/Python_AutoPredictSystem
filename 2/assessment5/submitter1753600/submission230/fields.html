    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a  DNA-demethylating agents.<b><span>Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating class of epigenetic inhibitors. </span></b><br />Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.<br />Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold.   One way            that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.             By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes            is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><b><i><span>On the paternal allele, methylation of the ICR prevents binding of CTCF. The enhancers can access the Igf2 promoter, leading to Igf2 expression.<br /><span>On the maternal allele, the ICR on the maternal allele is normally not methylated. CTCF binds to the ICR and blocks the enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promoter, leading to no Igf2 expression.<br /><span>In Wilm’s tumour, the ICR on the maternal allele is methylated. Methylation of the maternal ICR prevents CTCF from binding, thereby allowing the enhancers to access the Igf2 promoter.<br /><span>As a result of disrupted imprinting at the Igf2 locus, the growth-promoting factor Igf2 is overexpressed and contributes to tumour growth.</span><br /></span><br /></span><br /></span></i></b></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b><i><span>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so changing the DNA methylation pattern can have effects that last beyond mitosis.<br /><span>Sensitive periods refer to particular periods when epigenetic marks are cleared and reset, i.e. reprogrammed.<br /><span>Sensitive periods include germ cell development and early embryonic development.<br /><span>It would be preferable to avoid treating patients during sensitive periods as epigenetic marks are being established and inhibiting DNA methylation could have more pronounced effects on the genome at these times.</span></span></span><br /></span></i></b></div>
