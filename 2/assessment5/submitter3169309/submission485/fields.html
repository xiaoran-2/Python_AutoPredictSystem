    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the the add-up of a methyl group to the 5' group of cytosine within CpG dinucleotide. Methylated CpG island is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure and can also prohibit transcription factor binding. Thus methylation at CpG island causes silencing of gene expression. However, in cancer cells , the normal state of DNA methhylation is disrupted. There could be genome-wide hypomethylation and locus specific hypermethylation. Locus specific hypermethylation can lead to silencing of the tumour suppressing gene, thus the tumour cell will grow without any suppression and will finally develop into cancer. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements condenses these sequences into heterochromatin in normal cells. However, in cancer cells these elements are hypometylated, which means they are unwinded and activated, as a result there could be illegitimate recombination beween repeats, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. These all increase the extent of genome instability, which will lead to reciprocal translocations, deletions, insertions to occur in the genome and make the genome more unstable. Thus the increasing genome instability may lead to change in the genome and epigenome and there may be silencing of the tumour supressing gene but activation of tumour growth gene, and finally it causess cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">For paternal allele in the normal cell, ICR is silenced and H19 is methylated, thus the enhancer will enhance the expression of Igf2. For maternal allele in the normal cell, ICR is activated and allowed CTCF to bind, H19 is not methylated, thus enhancers will enhance the expression of H19 but not Igf2. In Wilm's tumour, both the maternal and paternal ICR and H19 are methylated. The hypermethylation at the maternal ICR makes the H19 inaccessible to the enhancers, so the enhancers will instead enhance the expression of Igf2. As a result, in Wilm's tumour cell, the production of Igf2 is doubled but no production of H19. As H19 is one of the growth restricting gene, silencing of H19 will cause unlimited growth of tumour cells which contributes to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">According to the article, Decitabine is a "DNA-demethylating agent", which means its effect is to reduce methylation in the genome. Thus Decitabine is probably  inhibitors of DNA methyl transferase (DNMT). Because it inhibits its target DNMT from putting methyl group to the CpG island, the genome will be hypomethylated. As a lot of cancers are caused by locus specific hypermethylation of the tumour suppressor gene, the malfunction of DNMT will loose the sequence and allow some expression of the suppressor genes. Thus the unlimited growth of the tumour cells can be controled.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, thus altering DNA methylation can be passed on to the next generation, making the effects enduring on the epigenome. Sensitive period is a<span> period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals, and all the epigenetic marks are being established. Sensitive periods of development include early embryonic development period and primordial germ cell development period. Targeting patients during sensitive periods would be invasive because that drugs will disturb the establishing of normal epigenetic state of the genome. As the genome is sensitve to evironment in this period, the epigenetic drug treatment will have a exaggerated effect which is harmful to the patient (EED period) or the child of the patient (PGC development period).</span></div>
