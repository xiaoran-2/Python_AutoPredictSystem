    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The normal function of the methylation of CpG sites in the promoters of genes is to inhibit the expression of a gene. In the case of cancer, the CpG islands tend to be methylated, being the intergenic regions and repetitive elements less methylated.Methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions aims to stabilize the genome, limiting the mobility of these components and reducing the rate of mutation associated with it (deletions, insertions, translocations, activation / gene silencing).<div>Howewer , Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in a cancer cell are hypomethylated, helping the mobility of these elements and genome instability. This hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements cause deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations, generating activation/silencing of genes and greater genetic instability.</div><div><br /></div></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation pattern of the paternal allele has this  next structure:  monitoring region CTCF is methylated so the enhancers act on lGF2 lgf2 is expressed.Howewer,  the methylation pattern of the maternal allele consist in that the  monitoring region CTCF is not methylated, so it binds its insulator element and it means that enhancer acts on H19, so lgf2 is silent and we don't see expression.<br /><br /><div><div> In Wilm's tumour, there is a methylation of monitoring regions not only in the maternal allele but also in the paternal one, so there is a double lgf2 expression compared to a normal cell. This affects the appearence of a typical kidney tumor of childhood. <br /></div></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a class of epigenetic inhibitor that belongs to DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine demethylates <span>certain regions of the genome and it is useful to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, acute leukemia of the myelogenous precursors.</span><div>It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, allowing for example the expression of certain tumors suppressor genes. <br />In this case , Decitabine is very useful because the myelodysplastic syndromes are strongly  associated with methylation of CpG islands, and Decitabine can fix that.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> Altering DNA mathylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because  they act on the enzyme epigenetic regulators which modify the epigenetic imprent and this can be stored indefinitely in the cells.As we saw a sensitive period is a period during wich there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms.The are two sensitive periods: from the gametes to the formation of the epiblast and from the primordial germ cells to the gametes.Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the use of drugs would produce the inhibition of the epigenetic machinery.<div><br /></div></div>
