    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), is a nucleoside analog which irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) after they are incorporated into DNA.  They are therefore replication dependent, although their exact mechanism of action is unknown.  </p><p>Decitabine can stop the hypermethylation of areas of DNA, such as CpG islands, which are normally either unmethylated or hypomethylated.  By ending hypermethylation at these sites, decitabine stops the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, reactivating them and halting the growth of incipient tumors.  </p><p>Decitabline is often  used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, a precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML),   It is thought that DNMTi's are especially effective against hematological malignancies, since the former are dependent on tumor suppression gene hypermethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands within DNA are hypomethylated, and intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated.  Because methylated cytosines can be converted easily to thymines, the normal state hypomethylation at CpG islands serves to prevent point mutations, with their concomitant possibility of truncated or nonexistent proteins.  On the other hand, methylation of certain regions serves several key functions:   in intergenic regions, it silences cryptic transcription sites and splice sites, and may reinforce cell stability. At repetitive elements, DNA methylation helps maintain genomic stability through silencing and/or mutation of repeats to prevent transposition; through silencing of repeats to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and preventing "illegitimate" recombination.</p><p>In cancer, however, exactly the reverse situation prevails.  CpG islands and their shores are hypermethylated, resulting in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes.  This permits the unchecked replication of rapidly dividing cells, such as those found in cancer:  there is now no "gatekeeper" to stop them.  At the same time, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancer, causing genomic instability, and leaving the genome open to additional pathological alterations.  Indeed, the epigenetic hallmark of the overall hypomethylation of DNA, with the exception of hypermethylation in specific locations.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The disruption of imprinting can contribute to the development of cancer.</p><p>As an example of the role of methylation in imprinting and gene expression in general, the H19/Igf2 cluster sits on the human chromosome 11, and is involved in enhancer blocking.  CTFC is an insulator protein, insulating Igf2 from downstream enhancers.  Methylation at the imprinting control region (ICR) of the maternal DNA block the binding of CTFC, which in term allows the paternal H19 to be methylated.  This second methylation silences the paternal H19, which allow the enhancers to access Igf2 and activate it.  In other words, if the maternal ICR is and paternal H19 are each methylated--and the former leads directly to the latter--Igf2 will be expressed.  If either one is not, then it won't.   </p><p>In cancer, hypermethylation of the maternal ICR results in overproduction of Igf2, which is implicated in the development of Wilm's tumor.  However, what is involved is more than simply the overproduction of a gene product.  The maternal H19 is also methylated:  in other words, the two strands of DNA, maternal and paternal, now look and act remarkably alike. It is this loss of imprinting that helps contribute to the development of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation results in mitotically heritable changes to the entire genome.  The epigenetic changes that DNA methylation makes possible thus survive cell division, and indeed, survive in all the daughter cells of the original progenitor cell.  Therefore, drugs that alter DNA methylation can certainly have effects in the patient that last far beyond the treatment period.</p><p>However, such drugs may have effects that go beyond the life of the patient, depending on when they are administered.    Epigenetic markers are routinely removed with the exception of two "sensitive periods":  early embryonic development, and during the differentiation of the germ cells. If a drug that alters DNA methylation were to be administered during one of these periods, marks that should have been removed might remain on genes for a very long period of time.  Moreover, it could theoretically lead to inheritable changes between the generations, although documented cases in which that has happened have been scant.  Inheritable changes could result from epigenetic marks not having been properly removed from a developing germ cell.  Since the germ cells of girls and women are in meiotic arrest for decades, pharmaceutical companies wishing to avoid inheritable changes are faced with a real problem.</p></div>
