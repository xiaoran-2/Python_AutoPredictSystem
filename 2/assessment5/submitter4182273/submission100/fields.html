    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA is methylated especially at intera-genic and near repetitive segements, while it is not methylated at CpG islands upstreem the promotors of tumor suppressor genes. Such pattern helps to transcription machinery to identify the correct promotor sequence, as unmethylated CpG islands guide and attract it to the correct position. Moreover, the intera-genic initiating sequences remains silent as well as repetitive elements.<br />In cancers, the methylation pattern go through a reverse pattern; thus, the CpG islands become hypermethilated while the intra-genic and repetitive elements lose their methylation. Therefore, the normal transcription decrease and the tumor suppressor gene under-express, while promotors at aberrant locations become sctive. So the transcription machinery goes out of control and start to express unwanted genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 gene is located at upstream of H19. Between them, there is a CpG island and at the downstream of the H19 are gene- enhancer.<br />This set of genes are imprinted so the H19 which codes for a long non-coding RNA is silent So that the enhancers can affect the Igf2 and enhance its expression.<br />On the other hand, on the maternal allele the CpG island is insulated so that the Igf2 can't be affected by the enhancers. So, the H19 which is not methylated just re-enforce the insulation. <br />If the maternal allele is imprinted too, the Igf2 on maternal strand will be expressed. The concomitant Igf2 expression lead to uncontroled over growth and Wilms tumor. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an inhibitor of methyl-transferase.<br />It is known that methylation of CpG islands at the upstream of tumor suppressor genes contribute in aberrant cell proliferation.<br />In the presence of Decitabine, methyl-transferase detect the CpG and stick to it the drug come to action and occupy the active site of the enzyme so that inhibit its action.<br />This help the downstream gene to remain functional in the mitotic daughter cells and contribute in anti-cancer machinery of them.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks will pass through mitotic cell divisions to the next generations of the cells.<br />Thus, alterations in the DNA methylation pattern will remain the same in the clone of cells that originate from a single mother. Therefore, the effect of epigenetic drugs will last even beyond their prescription period.<br />By altering the epigenome, the rest of daughter cells will re-gain some of their anti-cancer activity that has been disrupted by epigentic changes in their mother cell, due to methylated CpG islands or methylated intera-genic segments and repetitive elements. <br />However, there are sensitive period that epigenetic marks are erased, such as gametogenesis or before implantation of embryo, and soon re-establish for promoting differentiation and maturation of subsequent cells. During this period, interfering with epigenome will be harmful and should be avoided.</div>
