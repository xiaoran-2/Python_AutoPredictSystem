    <div class="field-value">Covering sites of transcriptional initiation, CpG islands in mammals are tend to be protected from DNA methylation. Nevertheless, DNA methylation on CpG islands occurs during X-inactivaiton. Methylated CpG islands can be bound by methylated CpG binding proteins e.g. MeCP1 &amp; 2. <br /><div>MeCP proteins have a DNA binding domain, transcriptional repression domain as well as ability to recruit chromatin condensing factors. These lead to silencing of the genes. Methylated CpG can also prohibit transcription factor binding, and leads to reduction of gene expression. Alterations in DNA methylation at CpG islands (due to age, environmental factors) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes (hypermethylation), or overexpression of growth promoting genes (hypomethylation), leading to the development of tumour.<br /><br />The main function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity. In intergenic regions, DNA methylation silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. In repetitive elements, DNA methylation leads to:<br /><ul><li>silencing of repeats to prevent transposition  </li><li>mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposition </li><li>silencing of repeats, so avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters </li><li>methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination</li></ul>Hypomethylation is the main mechanism at intergenic regions and repetitive elements that involve in cancer development.  Hypomethylation can cause:<br /><ul><li>Illegitimate recombination between repeats </li><li>Activation of repeats and transposition </li><li>Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes</li></ul>These will contribute to the development of tumour.<br /></div> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Paternal allele (Igf2) undergo methylation during embryo development. This lead to reduced Igf2 expression. Maternal allele (H19) is normally hypomethylated/unmethylated during fetal development.  In normal cells, the paternal IGF2 and maternal H19 genes are expressed. Several sites upstream of H19 are methylated on the 
paternal allele (filled circles) and unmethylated on the maternal allele
 (open circles). In Wilm's tumour, the maternal chromosome reverses to
 a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the 
H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell
 growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine  is  a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methytransferase. This allow tumour suppressor gene to be better express <br /><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
