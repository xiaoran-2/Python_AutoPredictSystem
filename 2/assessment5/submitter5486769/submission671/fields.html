    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpG
dinucleotides are methylated to a greater extent in normal tissues, although
CpG islands located in promoters of tumor suppressor genes are generally kept
free of such epigenetic mark. In cancer, hypermethylation of these regions
ensues, bringing about the silencing of a powerful counterbalance of neoplasia.
For example, epigenetic silencing of <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>RB</em> impairs normal cell cycle
control-points, increasing the likelihood of survival of cells carrying genetic
errors. On the other hand, it is usual in malignant cells to find progressive
hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Normally, they
are kept methylated to preserve genomic stability by inhibiting the action of
transposable elements that may disrupt DNA sequence integrity; therefore, in
cancer, this abnormality potentiates mutations and aberrant gene expression.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>One
further epigenetic abnormality seen in cancer is loss of imprinting, In Wilm’s
tumour, a type of pediatric kidney malignancy, the maternal ICR, which is normally
unmethylated (since the paternal ICR is methylated) and to which CTCF binds,
suffers from aberrant methylation, so both maternal and paternal ICRs are
methylated. Thus, the expression of <em>H19</em> from the maternal allele is lost,
whereas enhancers act upon both paternal and maternal copies of <em>Igf2</em>, resulting
in a double dose of a growth promoter. This double dose hence stimulates undesired
proliferation, contributing to cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine,
an FDA-approved drug belonging to the class of the DNMT inhibitors or
nucleoside analogues, exerts its antineoplastic effect in a replication
dependent fashion, since it must be incorporated into DNA of dividing cells to
act on DNMT1. The drug irreversibly binds de novo methyltransferases that copy
the methylation marks to daughter strands of DNA. Given that cancer cells
replicate more rapidly than normal cells, Decitabine has a greater effect on
neoplastic tissues than on the rest of the body. It blocks the mechanism by
which cells pass on their methylation marks to the progeny, thereby rendering
cancer cells more susceptible to the action of other chemotherapeutics and less
capable of preserving their aberrant methylome through subsequent cell
divisions.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In terms of epigenetics, a sensitive period refers to
a critical point in which extensive epigenetic remodeling takes place. The 2 key
periods when this ensues is the preimplantation of the embryo and during
gametogenesis. Having said that, treating patients with drugs that act upon
modifying epigenetic mechanisms during pregnancy, or early in life, might have
profound effects that may only become apparent many years after the exposure.
Since it is still not fully understood to which extent transgenerational
inheritance of epigenetic marks takes place, utilizing such drugs may not only
affect the tumour being treated, but also the gametes of that individual. Given
that DNA methylation is a keystone for<span>
cell type specific gene expression signature establishment, and that it is also
an important mechanism to preserve genomic stability, using epigenetic
inhibitors can also have enduring effects on children, possibly rendering them
more prone to secondary malignancies later in life. </span></span></p></div>
