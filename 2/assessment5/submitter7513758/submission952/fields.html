    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>In normal adult cells, most CpG islands are methylated, but some are not.  Cancer cells tend to have less methylation overall (hypomethylation) but more methylation (hypermethylation) in CpG islands.  Often this has the effect of silencing a “tumor suppressor” or anti-growth gene, allowing the cell to multiply more effectively, so such cells are favored in a within-cancer evolutionary process.  The “shores” of CpG islands are regions adjacent to CpG islands on either side, and these, too, tend to be hypermethylated in cancer.</p><br /><ul><li><p><em>Describe the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.</em></p></li></ul><p>Normally, CpG islands are methylated in order to silence an adjacent gene, or left unmethylated in order to allow gene expression</p><ul><li><p><em>Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.</em></p></li></ul><p>In cancer cells, more CpG islands tend to be methylated, inappropriately silencing genes that should be active. </p><ul><li><p><em>Explain how disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.</em></p></li></ul><p> Sometimes these are “tumor suppressor” genes, so the cancer has freed itself from a constraint.</p><ul><li><p><em>Describe the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Describe how DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Explain how disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to cancer.</em></p></li></ul><p>Normally, these regions are methylated.  Methylation in these regions tends to keep the DNA balled up where it can’t recombine inappropriately.  Normally, recombination takes place only between homologous genes, but repeat regions might match up by accident, just because they are repeat regions.  Left unmethylated, they are exposed and can recombine inappropriately.  This is one kind of genome instability.</p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting of genes is the labeling of maternal or paternal origin via methylation.  One of the two can be turned permanently off. Imprinting is sometimes lost in cancer, resulting in inappropriate expression.<br /><br />There is a region (H19) between a promoter and the IGF2 gene that is normally unmethylated in the chromosome of maternal origin, barring expression, but is methylated in the paternal chromosome, allowing expression.  In Wilm's tumor, the imprinting is lost, so that both copies of the IGF2 gene are expressed, doubling the cell's dose of IGF2, and upregulating growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA de-methylating agent.  It removes methyl groups from DNA, which is useful in treating myelodysplastic syndromes.  Wikipedia (though not The Economist) says that it acts by inhibiting methyl transferases.  This can be useful only in cancers that tend to be associated with hypermethylation, for example certain blood cancers.  De-methylation might be of benefit when methylation has silenced a tumor suppressor gene.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is copied when a cell replicates, so drugs that alter methylation can have a long-acting effect.  There are two "sensitive periods" during development: in the creation of germ cells (sperm or egg), when DNA methylation is stripped to make a pluripotent cell, and during early embryonic development, when basic methylation patterns for a lifetime are being laid down.  Epigenetic drugs might be especially dangerous if administered to a mother or father during either of these times, because it could disrupt methylation patterns in the embryo, with lifelong consequences.</div>
