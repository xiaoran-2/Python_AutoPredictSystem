    <h1>Submission 1041 from Anon (session_user_id: b907210070733e5674da0f839646439ab636132b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine is a hypomethylating agent and antimetabolite used <span>for the treatment of myelodisplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, thus having a twofold effect as an anticancer drug. Administered intravenous, decitabine acts at a systemic level showing no significant cell type affinity. Once in the cytoplasm, decitabine is able to permeate the nuclear membrane and is incorporated into the DNA during replication and RNA during transcription. This leads to the inhibition of methyltransferase in that sequence, which</span><span> results in hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation, thus having an anti-tumour effect.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">Cancer is a disruption of the normal cell lifecycle resulting in aberrant proliferation and loss of normal function as a result of genetic and epigenetic changes that act upon each other in a reinforcement loop. The foundation of the epigenome is the methyl group bound to cytosine residues. On of the most abundant epigenetic mark is the DNA methylation at CpG islands, which is almost completely associated with gene silencing. In normal cells, this is a mechanism to induce differentiation. In cancer cells, however, numerous genes that regulate proliferation and respond to apoptotic signals are silenced by methylating their CpG islands. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in healthy cells in order to maintain genomic stability. Malignant cells, on the other hand, display less methylation at this regions. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements may increase the frequency of illegitimate recombinations which result in the activation of cryptic promoters and the disruption of neighbouring genes. Overall, this leads to high proliferation and low response to termination signals, as seen for example in follicular lymphoma, the result of a chromosomal translocation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster is responsible for maintaining the balance between the Igf2 growth factor and H19 tumour suppressor required for normal cell development. This is achieved with the help of imprinted genes. In healthy cells, the paternal allele exhibits DNA methylation around the imprinting control region, which blocks the binding of CTCF, an insulator protein, thus exposing the Igf2 promotor to downstream enhancers. The ICR methylation also spreads to the nearby H19 promoter, silencing its expression. On the maternal allele, however, the opposite takes place. CTCF binds successfully tot the ICR, insulating the Igf2 promoter from the downstream enhancers and allowing the transcription of H19. <span>In Wilm's tumour, a kidney cancer that typically occurs in children, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth. Without a tumour suppressor, cell proliferation goes awry, resulting in pathogenesis.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation serves many purposes, the most important being gene silencing at CpG islands, genomic imprinting and genomic stability. All these effects are crucial for normal cell development and proliferation and thus must be mitotically heritable. This is achieved with the help of DNA methyltransferases, which lay epigenetic marks on the hemi-methylated DNA. In the absence of DNMTs, DNA would be passively demethylated. Novel therapies involve targeting the epigenome by altering DNA methylation. These are used especially against cancer, where the epigenetic machinery goes awry. The advantage of these therapies is that all epigenetic changes that are induced persist due to the effects of DNMTs during replication. However, the effects are systemic, meaning that all cells may undergo epigenetic modifications. This is especially problematic for young people, as long term effects are unknown and pregnancy during the periods of epigenetic reprogramming. Drugs that interfere with the epigenetic machinery during such sensitive periods may result in abnormal embryonic development or fatality, germline abnormalities or even long term afflictions for young adults.</div>
