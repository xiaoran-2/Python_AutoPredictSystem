    <div class="field-value">1. Describe the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br />- CpG islands methylation inactivates specific genes epigenetically.<br /><br />2. Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br />- CpG islands hypermethylation causes hypomethylation in intergenic and repetitive regions of tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br />3. Explain how disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br />- DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer. <br />- Hypermethylation in CpG promotor can decrease transcription of tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br />4. Describe the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br />- DNA methylation inactivate intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal conditions.<br /><br />5. Describe how DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br />- In cancer, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is decreased. <br /><br />6. Explain how disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to cancer.<br />- DNA hypermethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive regions can affect imprinting control regions.<br />- Disrupted expression of imprinting control regions can affect the genetic expression of tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status.  (Week 4)<br />- Paternal ICR is methylated and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate.<br /><br />2. Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status.  <br />- Maternal ICR is not methylated and enhancer can't access Igf2 due to CTCF, insulator protein.<br /><br />3. Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.  <br /><div>- Imprinted disorder results in loss of Cdkn1c (tumour suppressor, growth suppressing) and upregulation of Igf2 (oncogene, growth promoting) <br />- This is related with various abnormalities in linked Kcnq1 and H19/Igf2 clusters.</div><div><br /></div>4. Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer. <br />- It can inactivate tumor suppressor genes and activate oncogenes.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.  <br />- Decitabine belongs to DNA hypomethylating agent<br /><br />2. Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation. <br />- ??<br /><br />3. Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.  <br />- Inactivation of DNA methyltransferase<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. <br />-  By<span> both transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and mitotical epigenetic inheritance</span><br /><br />2. Define what is meant by a sensitive period. <br />- It means the periods when epigenetic regulation can be changed by some external environment.<br /><br />3. Identify sensitive periods of development. <br />- Sensitive periods means early embryonic and germ cell development periods.<br /><br />4. Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable. <br />- Disruption of epigenetic regulation means another problem.
