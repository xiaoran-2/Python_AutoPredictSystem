    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">  It is relatively common to find that cancer cells display a loss of imprinting whereby a gene or genes are either expressed or silenced from both parental alleles as opposed to being expressed by one allele and not the other.  This may be the result of either hypomethylation or hypermethylation of the imprint control region.  <br />  In the H19/Igf2 cluster, we find that the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele of a normal cell.  Because the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele, the enhancers act on Igf2 to express this growth promoter.  On the maternal allele, CTCF binds the ICR and the enhancers act on H19 leaving Igf2 silent.  We see Igf2 expression from the paternal allele but not the maternal allele.<br />  In Wilm's tumor, by contrast, we see expression of Igf2 from both the paternal allele AND the maternal allele.  The ICR of the maternal allele is also methylated meaning that CTCF doesn't bind there and so the enhancers act on Igf2.   The cancer cell is providing a "double dose" of Igf2 which is growth promoting, thereby contributing to cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">  In cancer, we see both locus-specific DNA hypermethylation and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation.  In a normal cell, the CpG islands are relatively unmethylated and we see methylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  In cancer, we may see hypermethylation of CpG islands and hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. <br />  DNA methylation of the CpG islands is typically associated with gene suppression and in cancer, we find the tumor suppresor genes are suppressed by this hypermethylation of the CpG island promoter.  Suppressing a tumor suppressor gene means it can't act to help stop the uncontrolled growth of the cancerous cell.  Because methylation is mitotically heritable, it gets passed on with the rapidly dividing cancer cells.<br />  DNA methylation of the repetitive elements is important is maintaining genomic stability.  In cancer cells, the hypomethylation of the repeats, leads to instability and we see translocations, deletions and/or insertions.  The hypomethylation of repeats causes the DNA to be less tightly packed and, therefore, open to errors and situations where the repeats jump to other sections of the DNA disrupting things.   This can lead to tumors that are driven by chromosomal instability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">  Decitabine is a member of a group of DNA methyl transferase inhibitors (DNMTi).  DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.  When a cell is dividing, the two methylated DNA strands split to become two sets of hemi-methylated DNA.   Hemi-methylated DNA is the substrate for DNMT1, an enzyme that helps to lay down the methylation found on the first strand onto the second strand, resulting in methylated DNA.<br />  Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that gets incorporated into the DNA of a dividing cell.  When the DNMT binds to it in an attempt to faciliate methylation, it becomes irreversibly bound to the nucleoside analog.   In other words, it gets stuck and can no longer bind to nucleotides to facilitate methylation.   In this way, decitabine effectively reduces the amount of DNMT available.  This has anti-tumour effects due to hypomethylation.  This is effective is cancers relying on tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">  DNA methylation is an epigenetically stable mark that is passed on to daughter cells and to the daughter's daughter cells.  DNA methylation is maintained in the epigenome by DNMT1.  Any drug that alters the DNA methylation of a cell will have also altered the DNA methylation of that cells daughter cells and granddaughter cells because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.<br />  Sensitive periods of development are periods when the epigenetic marks are being erased and rewritten.  The two key sensitive periods are (1) the period of primoridal germ cell development to production of mature eggs and sperm and (2) pre-implanation and early post-implantation.  During these periods of epigenetic reprogramming, we should be wary of treating patients with epigenetic drugs.  First, any drugs used at this time could impact the patient's eggs or sperm and therefore would be a reproductive risk.  Second, during the sensitive period, lots of epigenetic marks need to be laid down.  Impairing the ability of the cells to lay down these marks could lead to massive unintended consequences and an epigenome that does not allow for good quality of life.</div>
