    <h1>Submission 1072 from Anon (session_user_id: b15c9ee27a1e1cf6db544a89d9ed98bf22da5c0e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In contrast to the genome, epigenetic states are more dynamic. Recent
studies suggested that the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic states
might be particularly sensitive to environmental influences during specific
stage.</p><p>DNA methylation marks are almost completely erased in the peri-implantation embryo and then methylation patterns are set up all over the genome.</p><p>The sensitive periods to epigenetic control seem to be most sensitive to
changes in the environment (changes to the diet can also influence). In
addition, there are brief windows in time when particular (tissue specific) organs
will have a very sensitive period as well.</p><p><span> The two major periods
that are actually sensitive to epigenetic control through the genome are:
during Primordial germ cell development (PGC) and during early embryonic
development, stages during which
methylation patterns are erased and reprogrammed in mammals</span></p><p>Therefore, administer drugs to
patients in those sensitive periods can produces epigenetic changes in the
genoma and therefore would be inadvisable.</p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a FDA approved drug used to treat myelodys plastic syndromes.</p>

<p>Decitabine belongs to the <b>DNA methyltransferase inhibitors</b> (DNMTI), nucleoside analogues drugs that irreversibly
bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA. Their action is division
dependent, so the cell has to be replicating and therefore, the cancer cells will
be more severely affected (due to they are dividing much more rapidly than most
other cells).</p>

<p><span>These drugs are acting in the range which cause
DNA demethylation, so they have a very good anti-neoplasic effect, killing the
tumor cells. Possibly, they are most effective in myelod plastic  syndrome because it might be dependent on CpG
island hypermehylation.</span></p>

<p><span>The patients tolerate the lower doses of DNMTI administered
much better than in the 70s (higher dosis that were very toxic and with
terrible side effects), having not only a superior life expectancy, but also an
improvement in their quality of life.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster: example of hypermethylation of imprint control regions in cancer:</p><p>H19 contains a differentially
methylated region that is also an imprinting control region, which is differentially
methylated at its CpGs according to parental inheritance. So, H19/Igf2 is methylated on the paternal allele,
whereas it's unmethylated on  maternal allele.</p><p>When it's unmethylated, CTCF binds its insulator element (i.e., the
enhancers will act on H19, but Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so
we don't see expression on the paternal allele, because it´s methylated, so the
enhancers can act on IGF2). However, with loss of imprinting there is
hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. </p><p>On the other hand, on the maternal allele, there is also expression of
Igf2, and there is a double dose of Igf2 vs a normal cell, and Igf2 is both
growth promoting, being associated with a pediatric or childhood tumor of
the kidney called Wilm's tumor.</p><p>







</p><p>In normal cells, the paternal IGF2
and maternal H19 genes are expressed. In tumors with LOI, the maternal
chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of
methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 on, and H19 off, causing
increased cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation (i.e. the addition of a methyl group to the DNA), occurs
predominantly at CpG dinucleotides in mammals. It helps to maintain genomic
stability in several different ways and it's laid down by the DNA methyl
transferases. It´s essential for life and for viability of a cell.</p>

<p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and it´s an inactive epigenetic
mark. It can be removed either passively, or actively. So, this passive
demethylation requires that the DNA be replicated, can happen through this
dilution effect. But active demethylation it's an enzymatic removal of the
methyl group via several chemical intermediates, and although it seems to
involve predominantly the TET proteins, it can happen in several different
ways.</p>

<p>Although DNA methylation can occur at CpG islands (in general they tend
to be un-methylated), they tend to occur at intergenic intervals and the
irrepetitive elements, where they tend to be methylated elements.</p>

<p>DNA demethylation happens in early development, and in primordial germ
cell development, and at later times and this can happen without having DNA
replication.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The global level of methylation decreases from a normal tissue through to
a metastatic tissue (neoplasia and then invasive tissue), whereas methylation becomes
more dense at some CPG islands (at the same time).</p>

<p>In cancer they're actually global, changes in DNA methylation (being a
hallmark of cancer). Every cancer studied has aberrant DNA methylation and is
that these intergenic intervals, and their repetitive elements tend to be
unmethylated. And therefore, you tend to see hypermethylation as a whole in the
genome</p>

<p>DNA methylation markers of cancer  means that you might be able to use these markers to be able to detect whether perhaps there's a tissue that is in fact cancer, compared with normal or indeed whether or not it's metastatic, being an important clinical outcome.</p>
