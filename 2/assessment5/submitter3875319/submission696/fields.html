    <div class="field-value"><p><span>One of the principal
characteristics of cancerous cells is the difference in both quantity and
location of DNA methylation compared with non-cancerous cells. DNA methylation
involves addition of one or more methyl(CH3) group to a cytosine(C) nucleotide
in a CpG (cytosine linked to guanine(G) via a phosphate bond) configuration.
CpG islands are clusters of CpGs, often located in gene promoter regions. In
non-cancerous cells DNA methylation density is low and when present is
associated with processes such as X-chromosome inactivation and imprinting. In
cancerous cells there is often hypermethylation of CpG islands and nearby ‘island
shores’ within 2kb of the islands. The consequence is epigenetic silencing of tumour
suppressing genes owing to DNA methylation being mitotically heritable. Also by
silencing tumour suppressors, such as RB in retinoblastoma and BRCA1 in breast
cancer a competitive edge is gained by cancerous cells over non-cancerous cells.
Cancerous cells divide more rapidly and live longer and thus proliferate to the
detriment of non-cancerous cells. </span></p>

<p><span>DNA methylation is abundant at
intergenic regions and serves to maintain genomic integrity. Cells without the
maintenance methyltransferase enzyme DNMT1 lose genomic integrity. Additionally
DNA methylation silences cryptic promoters whose RNApolymerase2-loaded
promoters could seriously interfere with genuine gene promoters.  <span>Repetitive elements function mutagenically to
‘copy and paste’ or ‘cut and paste’ into other locations. DNA methylation of
repetitive elements prevents mutagenic transposition by silencing the promoters
of the structural protein ‘gag’ and transcriptional protein ‘pol’. Cancerous
cells show hypomethylation of intergenic and repetitive elements compared to
non-cancerous cells, placing chromatin into a euchromatin/open state rather
than heterochromatin/closed form. This can lead to activation of cryptic
promoters, inappropriate transposition of repeats into gene coding regions and
illegitimate recombinations between repeats. Such aberrant functioning in
cancer cells results in chromosomal deletions, insertions, duplications and
translocations.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p><span></span><p>

<span>Disruption of imprinting affects
cancer proliferation, an example being when the two parental alleles of the
H19/Igf2 cluster on chromosome 11 are not differentially methylated. Insulin-like
growth factor 2 (Igf2) is an oncogene/growth promoter, separated from the long
non-coding RNA H19 by an imprint control region (ICR). Absence of methylation
on the maternal ICR facilitates binding of an insulator protein called CTCF which
insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. The ICR on the paternal allele is
methylated and blocks CTCF binding. DNA methylation then spreads into the H19
promoter region silencing H19 and allowing downstream enhancers to activate
Igf2. If the maternal ICR is methylated subsequent loss of imprinting prevents
genes from behaving in a monoallelic parent of origin manner. CTCF binding does
not occur and the preferred chromatin loop of enhancer to Igf2 is followed
rather than the usual maternal secondary loop of enhancer to H19. Over-expression
of the oncogene Igf2 arises from the maternal allele behaving like the paternal
allele resulting in a double-dose of Igf2 which can cause a childhood kidney
tumour called Wilm’s tumour. In general, high doses of Igf2 are associated with
both embryonic and childhood tumours but less so with adult tumours. </span></p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a US FDA-approved
DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor used in myelodysplastic syndromes
progressing to acute myeloid leukaemia. It is a nucleoside analogue which
targets an enzymatic epigenetic regulator and is incorporated into DNA upon
replication, irreversibly binding DNMT. Cells need to be in the process of
replication for the drug to take effect hence DNA methylation as an epigenetic
marker is no longer available to subsequent daughter strands and mitotic
heritability is lost. Decitabine is a non-selective drug affecting all cells
undergoing division, however the replication rate for cancerous cells far
exceeds that of non-cancerous cells thus the dose required is extremely low.
Non-cancerous cells appear to be susceptible only at very high dosage and the
majority of users have experienced few side effects. Although its absolute
mechanism remains unclear, Decitabine seems particularly effective because it
targets CpG island hypermethylation a classic indicator of poor prognosis in
haematological malignancies.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>Cancer causes genome-wide
hypomethylation coupled with tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation. DNA
methylation inhibitors promote tumour suppressors silenced by DNA methylation
at CpG islands, but this could be problematic at intergenic regions and
repetitive elements which are hypomethylated in cancer cells. However demethylation
of already hypomethylated regions would increase euchromatin further thus increasing
accessiblity to chemotherapy drugs, especially when used in concert with histone
modifiers. This, along with slow removal of long-range epigenetic silencing
over millions of nucleotide bases, might explain the delayed positive response
observed by Dr Stephen Baylin from patients who didn’t respond initially but improved
noticeably following later chemotherapy. </span> </span></p>

<p><span>Sensitive periods occur when epigenetic
markers are removed through DNA demethylation. Early sensitive periods occur firstly
at pre-implantation to early post-implantation blastocyst stage then at primordial
germ cell to gamete stage. Throughout gestation as individual organs form,
further sensitive periods occur. Overkalix data showed that sensitive periods might
also occur at pre-pubescent stages for all children also the foetal and infant
stages for girls. Treating patients during sensitive periods would disrupt levels
of DNA methylation for imprinted genes and repeats which would not only affect
the patient but might have an adverse transgenerational effect upon potential children
and grandchildren.</span></p></div>
