    <h1>Submission 362 from Anon (session_user_id: 448ff09e8debf4ef7c9eabbbeed7b8849b6590e5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on epigenom because epigenetic cahnges, and DNA methylation is an epigenetic change, are passed on during cell division untill they are actively erased.  Sensitive periods are periods when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control. Development periods from gamets to epiblast and primordial germ cells to gametes development (due to epigenetic reprograming) and 
early life in general are beleived to constitute periods during which 
there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic 
mechanisms. Therefore, if we treat patients during early life (pregnant women - impact on the child) when environments have an effect on epigenetic control we could do more damage than good because we could make healthy cells react strongly to the treatement, which we do not want.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the <span>DNA-demethylating agents and is </span><span>used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine removes DNA methylaton and by doing that in tumor cells that are hypermethylated has an anti-tumor effect.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation (hypomethylated) independent of their activity state.Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression; however, CpG islands are exceptions for thar rule. Thus, in cancer cells, promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which silences the underlying gene and that can be a cause for cancer<span> especialy if the underlaying gene is tumor supressor. In normal celes, </span>intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions and its purpose is to keep the genomic stability (no deletions, no reciprocal translocations, no insertions). In cancer, intragenic regions are hypomethylated and consequence of hypometilation in repeats and itergenic regions is genetic instability. Genetic instability in general and specifically the one caused by hypomethylation of itergenic regions contributes to cancer.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting<span> is an epigenetic </span><span>phenomenon by which certain genes </span><span>are expressed </span><span>in a parent-</span>of-origin-specific manner and disruption of imprinting contributs to cancer because, either genes from both parents are expressed or gene is not expressed at all.<b> </b>H19<b> </b>i<span>s a gene for a lnc RNA</span>. lncRNAs that are paternally expressed are involved in imprinting processes,  which is required for silencing the maternally expressed protein-coding genes Igf2r. In normal cells, the paternal Igf2 and maternal H19 genes are expressed. Several sites upstream of H19 are methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. In tumors, with loss of imprinting, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter - Igf2 turned on, H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth. Loss of imprinting of H19 on the maternal chromosome, when it occurs, could occur independently or could be influenced by events in the paternal chromosome.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
