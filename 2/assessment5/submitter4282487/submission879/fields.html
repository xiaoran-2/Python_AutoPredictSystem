    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands (CGI) are
unmethylated in normal cells are mostly found in the promoters of tumor suppressor
genes. Thus, these genes are active in normal cells. However, in cancer cells,
the CGIs are hypermethylated and thus tumor suppressor genes are silent/
inactivated leading to cancer. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements
of normal cells are methylated and inactive. Hypomethylation of these regions
leads to their activation which results in genomic insability. This may result
in deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in genome. Activation of
repeats by hypomethylation makes them less densely packed. They can jump from
one location to another in the genome disrupting the normal pattern of gene
expression.</p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Hypermethylation of Imprint
Control Region (ICR) leads to loss of imprinting. In case of H19/Igf2 cluster,
the ICR is methylated in paternal allele while unmethylated in maternal allele.
In normal cells, CTCF binds to unmethylated maternal allele and the enhancer is
unable to bind on Igf2 and rather acts on H19. Igf2 is silent for maternal
allele while it is active from paternal allele. In Wilm’s tumor, due to hypermethylation
of ICR, CTCF is not able to bind on ICR of both maternal and paternal alleles.
The enhancer is able to activate Igf2 expression from  both allele, resulting in double amount of
Igf2, which is a growth promoter leading to tumor. </span></p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drug Decitabine is a hypomethylating
agent. It acts as inhibitor of DNA methyl transferase. It is more specific for
DNA. It reduces the levels of CpG island (CGI) methylation in DNA. It can
remove the methyl groups from the promoters of tumor suppressor genes and
activate them preventing the growth of tumors.</p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic marks of
methylation are mitotically heritable. They are passed on during cell division
to daughter cells and granddaughter cells until they are totally erased.</p>

<p>The epigenetic drugs influences
and modifies the methylation marks on DNA of a cell. The sensitive period of
layering of epigenetic mark on the genome is during early phase embryonic
development and growth. Thus, the epigenetic drugs should be avoided during
early phase of embryo development i.e. during early phases of pregnancy.</p><span>
