    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In normal tissue,DNA methylation at CpG island correlates well with gene expression, as it does in normal tissue differentiation, but in cancer CpG island is hypermethylated , which then causes silencing of the underlying gene.<br /><br />this causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue 
specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands <br /><br /><br />In cancer ,Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation in Repetitive regions, ICRs – loss of imprinting this can lead to Genomic Instability by Illegitimate recombination between repeats , Activation of repeats and transposition, Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes (c.f. Avy and Axinfu alleles) for example, Mouse models - hypomethylation due to deletion of Dnmt1 in specific tissues increases genomic instability .<br /><br />This all can lead to Hypomethylation genome-wide ,Tumour suppressor hypermethylation which will induce cancer.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth<br />restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes which is Common, early event, often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue e.g. Hypermethylation of ICR, Igf2 overexpression in Wilm’s tumour <br /><br />Imprinting is a dynamic process. It must be possible to erase and re-establish 
imprints through each generation so that genes that are imprinted in an 
adult may still be expressed in that adult's offspring. (ex. The 
maternal genes that control         Igf2 expression  will be imprinted in a 
male but will be expressed in any of the male's offspring that inherit 
these genes).<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> Decitabine is histone-deacetylase inhibitor is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.it will inhibit the activity of an enzyme called EZH2. This enzyme 
attaches methyl groups to histone proteins, which are part of the 
chromosomal packaging. A lot of lymphomas—cancers of the immune 
system—are caused by mutations that make EZH2 overactive. Such 
overactivity methylates histones more than they should be and thus 
silences the genes they surround, including so-called tumour-suppressor 
genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes 
cancer.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as 
imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of 
heterochromatin. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. Although DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark, which is 
passed on to subsequent cell generations, reprogramming of DNA 
methylation occurs during gametogenesis and after fertilization or after
 artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem
 cells (iPSC).<br /> methylatation of histones more than they should be and thus 
silences the genes they surround, including so-called tumour-suppressor 
genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes 
cancer.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
