    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpG islands (CGIs) are associated with the
promoters of at least 70% of the annotated genes, including house-keeping
genes. They are predominantly<strong> unmethylated</strong> in normal cells. If at all
methylated, it is done so as a mechanism to <strong>keep genes in switched-off state</strong>.
Thus CGI methylation is important in the <strong>maintenance and regulation of gene
expression </strong>and plays important role in various cellular processes like
embryonic development and chromosome stability. </span></p><p><span>Errors in methylation could be
a reason for several diseases especially various cancers. Global
hypomethylation and localized hypermethylation results in genomic instability
and disregulation. <strong>CpG island hypermethylation results in the silencing of
promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes, thus disregulating cell cycle, DNA
repair and allied processes.</strong> Accumulation of such abnormal gene expression
results is aberrant cell division and metastasis, contributes to the
development of cancer. </span></p><p><span>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are in turn
predominantly <strong>highly methylated</strong> in normal cells. Normally these regions are
highly methylated which is associated with <strong>maintenance of chromosome structure
and genome integrity</strong>. Changes in the methylation status of the intergenic
regions and the repetitive elements also contribute to cancer. Cancer cells
show extensive hypomethylation of these regions thus actively contributing to
the tumour progression by increasing the chances of <em><strong>transpositions,
transcriptional interference from strong promoters, illegitimate recombinations. </strong></em></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Imprinted genes are expressed from only <strong>one
parental allele</strong>. IGF2, which stimulates general growth is expressed only from
the paternal allele due to imprinting. The ICR for the IGF2/H19 locus is
<strong>methylated in paternal allele</strong>. The downstream enhancers therefore enhance the
expression of upstream IGF2. Whereas in the <strong>maternal allele due to the
unmethylated status </strong>of the ICR, CTCF binding is enabled, thus providing a
physical barrier to the downstream enhancers from reaching the IGF2 genes, thus
the enhancers act upon the H19 gene. </span></p><p><span>This methylation pattern ensures that <em>only</em>
paternal copy of IGF2 is expressed at any given time to maintain the dosage. In
Wilm’s tumour hypermethylation of the ICR results in the<strong> methylation of
maternal copy too</strong>, thus preventing the binding of CTCF to the ICR. With no
physical barrier the downstream enhancers can now promote the expression of the
maternal copy of IGF2 along with the normal expression of the paternal allele.
The effect of the overexpression of IGF2 is reflected in the <strong>growth and
metabolic processes along side tumourogenesis</strong> in Wilm’s tumour.  </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine, marketed as Dacogen is a cytidine
analog. It belongs to the class of <strong>DNA methyltransferase inhibitors</strong>. Hypermethylation
induced gene silencing plays a central role in tumourogenesis, by
downregulating the expression of tumour suppressor genes. This downregulation
causes dysregulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.
<strong>Decitabine inhibits the action of DNMT thus preventing excessive methylation</strong> of
the genes, thus effectively reversing the hypermethylation induced gene
silencing. The regulation of <strong>cellular proliferation and sensitivity to
apoptosis is restored </strong>in the cell by decitabine, thus bringing about
anti-tumour effect. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is <strong>mitotically heritable,</strong>
therefore altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome,
lasting well beyond the period of the drug administration. </span></p><p><span>However usage of such
drugs is contraindicated during the sensitive periods of development, where the
<strong>DNA are highly sensitive to the changes in the environment</strong>. The sensitive
periods of development start from <strong>period of primordial germ cell development to
the production of gametes, and also the pre-implantation and early
post-implantation periods.</strong> During these sensitive periods an active remodeling
and reprogramming of the epigenome happens. Removal of the epigenetic marks and
re-laying of new marks happen during this period. If a patient is treated with
drugs that potentially alter DNA methylation during these periods, the
<strong>reprogramming of the epigenome will be affected </strong>causing drastic effects.</span></p></div>
