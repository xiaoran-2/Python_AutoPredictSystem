    <div class="field-value"><span>CpG islands are regions of 200 or more base pairs where more than 50% are cytosine-guanine pairs. They are primarily found in approximately 60% of gene promoters. In normal cells, these are unmethylated, and their methylation status is not controlling the state of the promoted gene. Any methylation is passed on to daughter calls, since CpG methylation is stable through mitosis. In many cancers, we find significant hypermethylation of specific CpG islands and island shores, known as CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype). The hypermethylation of the CpG islands that are the promoters of tumor suppressor genes results in silencing of those genes, genes that control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair.  Without these functions, cancer cells fail to be appropriately killed and divide more rapidly, causing the tumor to grow unchecked. The level of hypermethylation often increases as the cancer progresses.  Different cancers have different CIMP locations.<br /><br />In normal cells, repetitive elements and intergenic regions are generally hypermethylated and silent. In cancer, we see hypomethylation, loosening chromatin structures and leading to over-expression of the phenotype. Over-expression results in genomic instability.  For example, disruption of the heterochromatin surrounding BRCA1 is thought to affect its tumor supression function. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting is often associated with genes that promote growth. In cancer cells, we sometimes see hyper or hypomethylation of ICRs, which resut in over or under expression.  Over expression of growth promoters cause cancer cells to proliferate abnormally.  In normal cells, the paternal  ICR is hypermethylated at the location near the Igf2 and H19 genes. The hypermetylation blocks the CTCF promoter of H19, resulting in silencing of  H19 and expression of Igf2. In the maternal allele, there is hypomethylation of the ICR, and the CTFC promoter causes expression of H19, and silencing of Igf2. In Wilm's tumor, both alleles are hypermethylated, causing overepression of the Igf2 growth factor. The overexpression causes abnormal cell proiferation of kidney cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltranferase (DNMT) inhibitor.  DNMT is a epigenetic regulator that is responsible for methylation.  Decitabine is nucleoside analogue that binds to DNMT and does not allow it to be released to affect the daughter cell. This only affects cells during replcation, and therefore impacts the frequently replicating cancer cells more than normal cells. In this way, Decitabine inhibits methylation, allowing some tumor suppressor genes to remain active, leading to cell death for the affected cancer cells.This drug is effective against Myelodysplastic Syndrome that has progresses to AMR.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is persistent and passed on to daughter cells, so alterations will continue to affect the treated cell and its daughter cells.Sensitive periods for epigenetic effects are those periods of development when methylation is being altered actively in normal cells .Sensitive periods for methylation effects that would proclude cancer treatment with epigenetic drugs would be pregnancy or infancy when germ cells are developing. Altered epigenetic phenotype would affect all cells of the embryo or germ cells indefinitely furing these periods.</div>
