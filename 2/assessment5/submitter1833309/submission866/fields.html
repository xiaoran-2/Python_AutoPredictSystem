    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are commonly found in promoter regions and are usually unmethylated in normal cells irrespective of the active or silent state of the gene. However, in cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated leading to a silencing of gene expression. Silencing of tumor supressor genes can result in a loss of cell cycle control and promote tumorigenesis. <br /><br />In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to silence gene expression. However, in cancer these regions are hypomethylated. In the case of repetitive elements, this can result in chromosomal translocations where long repeats from different chomosomes recombine inappropriately which may cause aberrant gene expression promoting tumor growth. Unsilencing of intergenic regions may allow gene expression from alternative start sites or cause a change in the expressed protein which may lead to a change in cell cycle regulation or change epigenetic binding domains to promote cancer growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of genomic imprinting can lead to cancer due to changing the gene expression surrounding oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes. In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal imprinting control region (ICR) located between the Igf2 and H19 genes is methylated. This results in methylation and silencing of the downstream H19 gene and blocks binding of the CTCF insulator protein. This allows the enhancers downstream of H19 to access the Igf2 promotor resulting in expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele. In the case of the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, allowing CTCF to bind to the ICR and block the enhancers downstream of H19 access to the Igf2 gene. The enhancers can access the H19 gene resulting in expression of H19 and silencing of Igf2 from the maternal allele. (referred to Figure 2: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3314145/" title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3314145/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3314145/</a>)<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor the ICR betweeen Igf2 and H19 of the maternal allele is methylated like the paternal allele, resulting in twice the amount of expression of Igf2. Igf2 is a growth factor and when overexpressed can cause cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a nucleoside analog which acts as an irreversible DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Decitabine can be incorporated into the DNA during replication and acts as a substrate for DNA methyltransferase enzymes. A covalent bond is formed between Decitabine and the DNA methyltransferase, which cannot be broken. The DNA methyltransferase cannot copy the methylation to the daughter strand, thereby removing that epigenetic mark.  Use of this drug will result in less DNA methylation at sites such as at the hypermehtylated CpG islands found in cancer and therefore less gene silencing. This can alleviate the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, which can help to restore the normal cell cycle regulation and slow tumor growth. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have lasting effects beyond the last exposure to the drug because the epigenetic changes that are induced by these drugs (i.e. hypomethylation) are mitotically heritable <span>and all of the following daughter cells will maintain that unmethylated site. <br /><br />These drugs are not suitable for use during sensitive periods of development when epigenetic marks are being laid down and the cells would be susceptible to factors that could change the epigenetic marks. Epigenetically sensitive periods include preimplantation, organ development and </span>germ cell development. It would be inadvisable to treat patients with drugs that modify epigenetic marks during sensitive periods because the drugs are systemic, meaning that every cell in the body is exposed to the drug and may end up with epigenetic changes. Additionally epigenetic changes induced by these drugs are mitotically heritable, so these changes will affect the daughter cells of all exposed cells, including germ cells. If treated during a sensitive period, this could result harmful changes to developing somatic cells during organogenesis and to germ cells resulting in negative effects in future generations.</div>
