    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In normal cells, CpG islands are not methylated. Tumor suppressor genes are active.<br /></li><li>In cancer cells, CpG islands are methylated. This suppresses the expression of tumor suppressor genes. There is a direct correlation between the level of DNA methylation and the severity of the cancer. <br /></li><li>DNA is hypermethylated in cancer cells and disrupts the expression of tumor suppressor genes. This may be a single gene or a group of genes. Both paternal and maternal chromosomes may be affected. Since DNA methylation is heritable, there is a high selection value for the clonal line of cells containing the epigenetic alterations that do not suppress tumor growth.  <br /></li><li>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are  heavily methylated.

This can activate or deactivate genes normally found in the cell. </li></ul><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">IGF2 and H19 alleles are relatively closely spaced on the same chromosome with an insulator region between them. In the male allele, the insulator region is methylated and does not bind the zinc-finger (CTCF) protein. The enhancer binds the promotor for IGF2 and IGF2 is transcribed  The enhancer has no effect on H19 and it is not transcribed from the male allele. In the female allele the insulator area between H19 and IGF2 is not methylated and allows the zinc-finger (CTCF) protein to bind. This blocks the enhancer from binding the IGF2 promotor. IGF2 is not expressed in the female. The enhancer does bind H19 and it is transcribed (It does not code for a protein but does code for a regulatory RNA molecule.) If imprinting is lost, both male and female copies are methylated and their insulator region does not bind the CTCF protein. Both of IGF2 are bound by the enhancer and two dose equivalents of IGF2 are made in those cells. Since IGF2 is a growth factor in fetal development, its overexpression can support tumorogenesis. (Note that H19 under expression has little effect in mouse models but over expression of H19 is associated with tumors also.)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (5-aza-deoxycytidine) is used to treat myelodisplastic syndrome (MDS).  *Decitabine is classified as a DNA-demethylating agent. **Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that is incorporated into DNA instead of cytosine during replication. It will affect rapidly dividing cells more than slowly dividing cells. When DNA methyltransferase encounters a substituted DNA, it binds irreversibly to the analog and blocks methylation. This results in hypomethylation of the DNA after several rounds of replication. ***Hypermethylation of CpG islands is thought to be involved in deactivating tumor suppressor genes in MDS. Decitabine could result in the hypomethylation of those sites previously deactivated and reactivate the tumor suppressor genes causing the cancer cells to die. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In reference to Dr. Baylin's comments, the state of DNA methylation is mitotically-heritable through multiple divisions. Once a pattern of DNA methylation is established, each round of DNA replication is followed by methylation of the new sister strand of DNA to match the mother strand. If the methnlation pattern is disrupted by drug treatment during cancer chemotherapy, the changes should be inherited by the progeny. Dr. Baylin's reference is to the fact that patients who did not have immediate results from treatment of epigenetic change in cancer, did have positively-altered patterns of sensitivity to latter cancer chemotherapy. Sensitive periods are times when epigenetic marks have been cleared and are actively being re-established. Examples are early developmental stages when cell pleuripotency is necessary and during the development of the primordial germ cell lines. Modification of epigenetic marks during these sensitive stages could result in serious effects to the individual latter on in development/life. These changes are not yet understood.</div>
