    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In normal cells, most of the CpG islands are unmethylated, only a small portion of CpG islands are methylated between cell types. CpG islands methylation is closely associated with X-chromosome inactivation. </span></p><p><span>In cancer cell, CpG islands become hypermethylated within the promoter genes, such as tumor suppressors, causes silencing of tumor suppressors, which results uncontrolled tumor cells grow.</span></p><p><span>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in the gene are usually methylated. The DNA methylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive regions maintains genomic integrity. The methylation in intervening region can silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. The methylation in repetitive region can silence the repeats to prevent chromosome transposition, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoter and prevent unwanted recombination. </span></p><p><span>In cancer cells, DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated, resulting  activation of downstream gene expression, which leads to less genomic integrity as mentioned in the above paragraph. Due to unstable chromosome, more mutations, disrupted cellular regulation can occur, which often results in cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In paternal allele: DNA at imprinting  control regions of H19/Igf2 cluster becomes methylated. The methylation at ICR blocks the binding of CTCF to the<i> </i>promoter of H19 gene. The downstream enhancers will be able to access and activate <i>Igf2 gene.</i></p><p>In Maternal allele, imprinting control regions are not methylated on H19/Igf2 cluster, methylation regulator CTCF binds ICR of Igf2, which prevents the downstream enhancer to activate igf2 gene expression.</p><p>Because of the genetic imprinting in normal cells, the expression of growth regulator Igf2 gene are tightly regulated. However, in the  Wilm's tumour, hypermethylation of ICR of H19/Igf2 is detected in maternal allele, which results Igf2 protein overexpression. Ifg2 regulates cell growth and differentiation. Especially during the embryo growth and development, lost of imprinting in H19/Igf2 ICR results in uncontrolled cell growth in Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decytitabine is a DNA-demethylating agents, which target DNMTs (DNA methyltransferase).  <br /><br />DNMTs transfer methyl group to DNA and cause DNA methylation. DNMT3a and 3b are de novo DNA methyltransferase , while DNMT1 maintains DNA methylation with the newly synthesized DNA. <br /><br />In tumor cells, CpG islands become hypermethylated and decytitabine reduce DNA methylation by inhibiting DNMTs function. Therefore, Decytitabine has anti-tumor effect.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> CpG islands are hypermethylated, histones are hypoacetylated or HDACs are overexpressed in most tumors. It's helpful using a a combination of histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine (demethylation agent) with standard therapy for cancer as describe by Dr. Baylin.</p><p> DNA methylation are mitotically heritable due to DNMT1.  Inhibiting DNMT3a and 3b reduce DNA methylation in tumor cells and reducing DNMT1 will pass on the reduced DNA methylation with cell division. Once the cancer cells are completely killed with the standard chemotherapy, new cells contain reduced methylation.</p><p>Different tumours have different dependencies: if driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation, inhibiting DNA methylation should suppress tumorigenesis; if the  tumors are driven by chromosomal instability, reduce DNA methylation may enhance tumorigenesis. Therefore, those drug are not for any cancer.</p><p>Most importantly, the epigenetic drugs are not selective and can target any cells. Cautions are needed during sensitive period. Sensitive period refers to early development and primordial germ cells development during embryo development, as they're the major stages of epigenetic reprogramming: DNA methylation is low and epigenetic marks are removed. If the drugs given during the sensitive period, DNA may remain low methylation and Epigenetic marks won't be reset correctly, which will be detrimental to the cells.</p></div>
