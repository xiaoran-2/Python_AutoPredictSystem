    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the really common features of  cancer cells is they display loss of imprinting,  either expressed from  both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles.we don't exclusively find hypermethylation of imprint control regions in cancer. You can also find hypomethylation of imprint control regions.Igf2 expression is paternal allele  methylated,  there is a imprint contraol region between the H19/Igf2 cluster  , and because its  paterna allel is unmethylated, so  no CTCF binds to insulator element,, and the enhacer act on IGf2 directly, and IGf2 expression occurs .On the other hand, the materl  allele is unmethylated, so the CTCF binds to insulator element, that blocks the way so the downstream enhance can not act on JGf2 , but act on H19 instead, result is H19 expression. </p><p> But in  loss of imprinting , there is a hupermethylation in  the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well, the same mechnism as metioned above, this again cause the  expression of Igf2,  result in a double dose of Igf2 in compare to the normal cell. Igf2 is growth promoting and  is associated with Wilm's tumor</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation  is  very stable epigenetic mark  which can stable passed on to the next cell generation , DNA methylation                  and Pc-G/trx may represent alternative systems of epigenetic memory that have been interchanged over evolutionary time.  This is the reason why Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy" , Drugs that  have effects through  alter  DNA methylation that last  beyond the drugs treatment since this altered methylation will passed on to the daughter cells and  then granddaughter  cells and so on . </p><p> But  there are some sensitive period  in which reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs .  These periods are important  in order to keep embryo develop .The periods  includes  pre-implantation development and germ cell development.  There are  two main reasons that  these sensitive period  epigenetic drugs are not advised,  the first one is disrupt the embryo normal development , and second reason is after reprogramming process, the epigenetic drugs  may not effect on that target sites anymore. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>
