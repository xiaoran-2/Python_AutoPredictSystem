    <div class="field-value"><p>During development, some epigenetic
marks are set throughout the genome in a cell type lineage specific manner in
order to control the information needed for the  normal development of the whole organism.</p>

<p>Dna methylation is one of those
epigenetic marks. The enzymes called DNA methyltransferases (  DNMT 3a and b) add  a methyl group to cytosines, mostly cytosines
that are followed by a guanine (CpG phosphodinucleotides). This methylation is
mitotically heritable thanks to DNMT 1</p>

<p>Methylation of CpG prevents the binding
of transcription factors and so, brings about gene silencing</p>

<p>These CpG,are mostly found in intergenic
regions, in introns and at repetitive elements; there are other places in the
genome particularly rich in these CpG , known as CpG islands. They usually are
at the promoters of tumour suppressor genes.</p>

<p> In normal cells,
the general rule is that CpG islands tend to be unmethylated , allowing tumour
suppressor gene expression, whereas CpG in repetitive elements are highly
methylated, silencing them, and so maintaining genomic stability</p>

<p>In
cancer., along with another epigenetic abnormalities , we find some changes in  dna  methylation patterns:</p><p>1. CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, so the expression of tumour suppressor genes is silenced and cell overgrowth is favoured.The surrounding regions of these CpG islands, known as CpG island shores are also hypermethylated</p><p>2. genome-wide hypomethylation.  dna hypomethylation progresses with time,
mostly at repeats and intergenic regions ,so, translocations, deletions,recombinations are more likely
to occur , This genomic instability may result in expression of strong cryptic promoters allowing an overexpression of oncogenes and thus cell overgrowth</p><p>The global level of methylation decreases as you progress from a normal tissue, through to a metastatic tissue.And at the same time methylation at CpG becomes more dense.The
hypermethylation of CpG islands is tumour specific, every tumour tends to hypermethylate a
particular set of CpG</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The cluster of genes H19/igf2 is located in chromosome 11.</p><p>This cluster of genes belongs to the group of imprinted genes, which means that there is a monoallelic parent of origin specific expression , the gene is usually expressed either from the mother or from the father</p><p> The imprint control region of this cluster is methylated on the patenal allele, so paternally imprinted</p><p>The imprint control región in the maternal allele is unmethylated which allows the binding of the CTCF transcription factor which insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers action so Igf2 is not expressed.These enhancers then act on H19 promoting its expression</p><p>In the paternal allele the methylation of the ICR prevents the binding of the insulator CTCF, so the enhancers act on Igf2 promoting its expression</p><p>In cancer, this particular cluster of genes suffers hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele, and so Igf2 is expressed on the maternal allele just like on the paternal allele, so there´s an overdose of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell. As Igf2 is growth promoting, its overexpression is associated  with Wilm´s tumour (a particular childhood kidney tumour)</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are currently 2 types of epigenetic drugs:</p><p>1. Dna demethylation agents,as decitabine an azacitidine</p><p>2.Histone deacetylase inhibitors.</p><p>Decitabine acts as a demethylation agent. One of the hallmarks of cancer is hypermethylation of CpG islands and shores, that silence tumor suppressor genes, thus promoting cell overgrowth and finally cancer. As Dna methylation is mitotically heritable,this results in a rapid overgrowth of the tumour cells.</p><p>Decitabine acting as a demethylating agent, demethylating one cell, means that its progeny may continue unmethylated and eventually stop a cancer growing without having to kill other cells</p><p>The combination of decitabine and a histone deacetylse inhibitor, alter the tumour cells in some lasting way that make them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are 2 main periods in development in which epigenetic marks  are cleared and reset. These periods are early development and primordial cell development.</p><p> The sperm and the ovum have their own particular set of epigenetic marks. When they fuse to form the zygote they have to , first, erase their epigenetic marks and then reprogramme them for developping the embryo. That is one of the main sensitive periods.</p><p>The other main sensitive period is during primordial germ cell development.When germ cells are developping they come from somatic cells so they have to undergo an erasure of somatic marks and a resetting of germ cell epigenetic marks</p><p>There are also other brief windows of sensitive periods in the development of particular tissues.</p><p>One of the epigenetic marks is Dna methylation which is mitotically heritable, so maintained in every particular tissue as all cells come from an original one.</p><p></p><p>Treating patients during these sensitive periods may result in a disruption of epigenetic marks bringing about functional consequences :loss of imprinted regions, hypomethylation in repetitive elements, hypermethylation in CpG islands...that can derive in some particular diseases and in cancer</p><p><br /></p><p></p><p></p></div>
