    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells the CpG islands are hypomethylated so the information we can find there is available. In cancer, the islands are hypermethylated  so the promotors of the tumor supressor genes are inactive and those genes are not expresed. The lack of tumor supressor genes leads to a non-stop cell division. <br />In contrast, the repetivive elements and the intergenic regions are hypermethylated in normal cells and hypomethylated in cancer cells. The hypomethylation of the repititive elements leads to illegitimate reconbination between repeats (because the chromatin is not densly packed), activation of repeats and trasposition and activation of cryptic promotors and disruption od neighbouring genes. These epigenetical changes contribute to the genomic inestability that we usually find cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated so CTCF is not binded to it and the enhancers activate the Igf2 gene while the H19 gene is silenced.</div><div>In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated so CTCF is binded to the ICR, that so, H19 gene is expresed and Igf2 is not expresed.</div><div>In Wilms tumor both alleles have the father's imprinting (methylation on ICR), so Igf2 is overexpressed.</div><div>This alteration is related with cancer because Igf2 is a growth promotor and its overexpression leads to a excesive cell growing which can be find in cancer.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA de-methylating agent, so it inhibits the DNA to be methylated. The antitumoral effect behind this drug consists in decreasing the amount of DNA which is methylated in our genome. It is known that the hypermetylation of the CpG islands, for instance, is related with cacer. As we know, the by metylating the DNA it is densly packed and is less likely to be transcribed. This silencing is usually used by cancer cells to inhibit the expresion of tumor supressing genes for example. Therefore, Decitabine may be able to inhibit the silencing of the tumor supressor cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The epigenetic alteraions caused by this drugs can persist even after the treatment because the epigenetic marks that are already establish are not going to be changed in shot time. Even if those marks are not meioticaly heredable they persist livelong in the individual who has had them. It is clear that altering some epigenetic marks, such as methylation, changes the epigenome, thus, even if we are able to inhiibit this methylation we are not able to do it with precission. Therefor, the effects are never focused in the main objective. In addition, there are some sensitive periods in which the apigenetic modifications are very active. For this reason, using epigenetic-drugs can be dangerous in pregnancy and during the puberty. Treating patients in this periods can be very dangerous because the epigenetic marks can be wrongly established and this can lead to some illness.</div>
