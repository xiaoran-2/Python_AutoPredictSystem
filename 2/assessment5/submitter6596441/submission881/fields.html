    <h1>Submission 881 from Anon (session_user_id: f8e9a3f8d577e526ab211cbca073499b32b5f4d3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to inhibitors of histone deacetylase, the drug can have an antitumor effect, as it inhibits DNA acetylation since acetylation favors expression of genes, and the drug will most likely have a mechanism action whereby methyl acetyl exchanged to help prevent the expression of tumor genes. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation is a process by which methyl groups are added by the various enzymes that comprise amino acids which histone DNA is compacted; the role of methylation in CpG islands is to reduce the expression or the expression of certain block mainly related to cell growth and proliferation genes.
In cancer methylation of CpG islands is altered, since the reduced methylation of these regions an excessive or uncontrolled expression that can not be stopped is raised; these regions are usually regulating the expression of certain genes that are related to cell growth and proliferation and are highly active during development of the embryo and fetus, but when the end of differentiated bodies and reach their full training, these genes are methylated and therefore are silenced.
Some cancers are associated with balanced translocations in which different parts of chromosomes are exchanged by two chromosomes; some parts of chromosomes are involved with cell growth but these are muted, and be a translocation, are located near a methylated promoter region or shortly, which will result in an abnormal proliferation of cancer cell. Thus, overexpression of these genes occurs not only by the absence of methylation of CpG islands, but also these regions might be lost during cell division by deletions of genetic material or they were located at other chromosomal region and are far from the gene to which they were regulating.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A sensitive period is a time period in which an organism has an increased susceptibility to external agents, which can alter some of the primary functions if it is malignant agent. In the case of humans, the most sensitive periods of development are primarily during embryonic development between 8 and 12 months of gestation  or some peridos childhood and adolescence.
Treatment in a sensitive period would be ill-advised, since in this period the body can suffer as much damage or alterations. In the event of antineoplastic treatment, if administered during sensitive periods of development, its effects can manifest themselves permanently, as most of them function by modifying epigenetic factors on DNA, and often these are necessary for the normal development of individuals , which can be highly affected by the removal of certain genes that form part of their development. As the treatment is based on inhibition of gene expression, being unspecific could affect other regions critical for normal development of the individual.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 is primarily related to growth during embryonic development and H19 are small non-coding RNAs involved in the regulation of gene expression, if heredity factor genes inherited from the father, these are highly methylated, is ie is not being expressed because the Igf2 factor is not involved as a growth factor, on the other hand the genes inherited from the mother is poorly methylated and as growth factor Igf2 are active, these genes have a tin proliferation in its expression.
If the expression is interrupted Igf2/H19 this can contribute to cancer and that while Igf2 promotes growth, H19 is a regulator of the expression, so an alteration in both can lead to the proliferation of cancer because H19 can be regulating the expression of growth factors, but can also be suppressing factors that encode tumor suppressors, whereas an excessive expression of Igf2 may lead to excessive cell proliferation leading to some form of cancer. This happens in Wilms' tumor is a malignant neoplasm of the kidney is most often caused by a tumor suppressor gene is altered</div>
