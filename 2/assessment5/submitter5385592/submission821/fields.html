    <div class="field-value">The DNA methylation at CpG islands will usually repress the gene expression atnormal condition.<br />in cancer, the global DNA methylation is downregulated, termed hypomethylation, however, at specific loci, such as CpG islands of tumor suppressor gene promoter, there is hypermethylation comparing to normal cells. The hypermethylation at CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes are going to downregulate the tumor suppressor gene leading to the tumorigenesis.<br />There are also DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, to maintain the genomic stability including inhibiting abnormal recombination, transposition and cryptic promoter disruption. However, in cancer, these elements are undergoing hypomethylation, leading to the genomic instability and finally give rise to cancer development. For instance, the hypomethylation at the repetitive elements lead to the abnormal translocation of the genome which may cause the gene fusion to generate the psuedo-oncogene expression and this finally trigger the cells to proliferate and transform into cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, there is hypermethylation at CTCF ICR element which can block CTCF binding at this element, and this methylation can spread to H19 promoter to silence the expression of H19. Then the enhance can access and activate Igf2 expression. <br />However, in the maternal allele, there is hypomethylation at CTCF ICR element, then CTCF can bind with this element and function as an insulator to block the activity of the enhancer. Thus the enhance can only activate the expression of H19 but not Igf2.<br />Wilm's tumor can be due to either loss of heterogeneity of the imprinted allele or the hypermethylation of H19. In the latter occasion, the normal methylation at H19/Igf2 is disrupted by hypermethylation on H19 promoter and ICR, leading to the repression of H19 expression, which is a potential tumor suppressor. The hypermethylation will inhibit the binding of CTCF at this element and the enhancer thus activate the expression of Igf2 which is a potential oncogene. The suppression of H19 and activation of Igf2 will trigger the cell to proliferate thus in turn transform into cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a kind of DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine will reduce the level of DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Given the fact that during tumorigenesis the cell undergoes hypermethylation at CpG islands and some other regions, especially the promoter region of tumor suppressors, inhibiting DNA methyltransferase will reduce the de novo DNA methylation to rescue the expression of the otherwise inhibited tumor suppressor. The expression of tumor suppressor will slow down the growth of tumor or even stop the tumor progression to have the anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The altered the DNA methylation can be passed down to the next generation of cell division. Therefore, whenever a cancer cell is treated with epigenetic drugs or is altered in the epigenome, such as change in DNA methylation, the traits can be passed down to the next several generation after cell division. This memory will keep the enduring effects on the epigenome.<br />The sensitive period is when the cells are undergoing establishment of epigenetic landscape or erasing the old epigenetic marks.<br />During development, two sensitive periods are the pre-implantation development stage and germ cell development stage.<br />The treatment during the sensitive periods will alter the epigenetic landscape and will have a long lasting effect on the patient other than other stages. This treatment will then have more side effects than treatment during other periods, such as disruption of the normal development processes and these side effects may be able to pass down to next generation.</div>
