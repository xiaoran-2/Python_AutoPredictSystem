    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found “up stream” near promoter regions of the gene being expressed and in normal conditions will not be methylated. In the case of tumor suppressor genes, there are often found multiple genes over several million base pairs. The non-methylated state allows for expression of the genes with their resulting protein products being utilized to suppress cancer. </p><p>But, this mechanism and others are disrupted in cancer. In some cancers, the CpG islands are found to be methylated, or hypermethylated. The result is a silencing of the expression of the tumor suppressor gene or genes.</p>
<p>With the tumor suppressor gene turned off, no tumor suppressing proteins will be produced and the cancer will be allowed to divide and grow. The methylated CpG islands are passed on mitotically to each daughter cell, maintained by the enzyme DNA (cytosine-5)- methyl-transferase-1 (DNMT-1). Also, it should be noted that DNA methylation in this context is itself mutagenic.</p>
<p>Normally, the tumor suppressor gene will have methylated CpG sites at inter-genomic regions to maintain genomic integrity by inhibiting deletions, insertions, duplications and translocations, and it will silence cryptic transcription (transcription interference). Methylation of repeats will cause silencing at these sites and inhibit transpositions; it may block transcription interference from strong promoters; and may assist with illegitimate recombination. This methylation is an epigenetic process, maintained by DNMT-1, and mitotically passed to each daughter cell during replication. </p>
<p>In some cancers, hypo-methylation is found genome-wide and is especially important when found at repeats. The result is illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of normally silenced repeats and transpositions. Cryptic promoters that cause transcription interference are affected at intragenic areas. </p>
<p>All of these disruptions lead to genomic instability. The potential to form abnormal karyotypes that are inherited mitotically are often preferentially selected for, so tumorogenesis is enhanced.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The <i>paternal allele </i>is normally methylated at the ICR  (<i>paternally imprinted</i>). The DNA methylation spreads “downstream” to the H19 promoter locus, a CpG island promoter, and is silenced. Enhancers are produced, which act on the Igf2 gene located “upstream” of the ICR and H19 locus; Igf2 gene expression is turned on producing the protein product insulin-like growth factor.   <br /></p>
<p><span>The maternal allele is non-methylated at the ICR and is bound by an insulator protein (CTCF). This results in the “upstream” Igf2 gene being insulate from the effects of the enhancers, so its activity is repressed. The enhancers are now available to act on the H19 gene, which is now expressed, producing a lncRNA.</span></p><p>Over-expression of the this oncogene will result in a double dose of protein, promoting cell growth and a predisposition to Wilm’s tumor (a childhood tumor found in Beckwith Wiederman syndrome). </p><p>This syndrome occurs when the maternal allele is disrupted to behave like the paternal allele. Loss of imprinting is often associated with cancer occurring through genetic mechanisms involving ICR, or by inheriting two copies of one parent’s chromosome. In BW, two paternal chromosome 11s. Post-translational epigenetic modifications may occur that result in loss of imprinting.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene CpG islands at promotors acts to suppress, or silence, the expression of these genes. There will be no production of their tumor suppressor proteins; tumor cell growth, angiogenesis and possible metastasis (depending on tumor type) will be uncontrolled.  DNA methylation at these sites is through the action of the enzyme DNMT-1. The result is that when cells divide mitotically, C-methylation is maintained by this epigenetic modification for each cell division.  </p>
<p>Decitabine is a DNMT-inhibitor approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, precursor conditions to AML.  </p>
<p>DNMT-inhibitor drugs are nucleoside analogues, which are incorporated into DNA during replication. They will irreversibly bind the DMNT and will not allow methylation to take place. </p>
<p>Methylated CpG islands result in silencing of tumor suppressor gene activity, thus, un-silencing through DNA-de-methylation or DNMT blocking by DNMT-inhibitor drugs allows for gene expression and protein production that will retard cancer growth.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG methylation is an epigenetic modification inherited mitotically. DNMTi drugs block hypermethylated CpG islands found in tumor suppressor genes. This and HDACi drugs, incorporated into rapidly dividing cancer cells, could convert heterochromatin to euchromatin, and allowing access to DNA by traditional chemotherapeutic agents. Transcription factor interference may be enhanced in cancer cells by DNMTI and HDACi. The outcome would be alterations in gene expression that may be long lived.       </p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those times when epigenetic re-programming takes place. During these times epigenetic marks are removed and then re-programed to be passed on throughout the life of each cell. These marks are DNA methylations, and other marks will be laid down during the lifespan of the individual.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods occur at two important times during development. First, pre-implantation development (where active, fast, de-methylation takes place in the paternal genome; the process occurs passively, slower, in the maternal genome).  Second, during germ cell development, or germ cell re-programming. </p>
<p>The epigenetic reprogramming that takes during sensitive periods involves de-methylation and methylation processes. Drugs, like DNMT-inhibitors, could block crucial methylation which reestablishes epigenetic marks. This might be equivalent to creating a “knockout” gene or genes resulting in an unstable genome or cell death.           </p></div>
