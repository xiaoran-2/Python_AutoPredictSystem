    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands, in most cases, serves to silence genes in proximity to the CpG islands, by preventing their transcription. <br />In cancer,these CpG islands are hypermethylated, which prevents the transcription of genes associated with control of the cell cycle, in particular tumour suppressor genes which stop cells with damaged genomes continuing to divide.<br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements decreases the transcription and activity of these DNA sequences, such that repetitive elements are not over-produced and do not get transposed excessively into other parts of the genome (which may lead to over- or under-expression of important genes), and intergenic regions are not over-transcribed or translated, which could also adversely effect gene expression.<br />In cancer, these intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated, meaning they are potentially over-expressed, leading to genomic instability, via the following mechanisms: transposition/insertion of repetitive elements into genes vital for cell cycle control (eg tumour suppressor genes), causing disruption of gene expression and uncontrolled cell division, over-expression of oncogenes (genes that can promote cell division), and general genome-wide instability, involving widespread errors in DNA replication and transcription.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation via inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. It acts as a nucleoside analog, so it is incorporated into the DNA during replication. Once DNA methyltransferase binds to the DNA altered by decitabine, it is irreversibly bound and cannot attach a methyl group.<br />This means that as the cancer cell genome replicates in preparation for cell division, it's methylation marks are not replicated, so the daughter cells will not carry these marks. As the methylation marks may be vital for uncontrolled cell division (via suppression of cell-cycle control genes such as tumour suppressor genes), this can stop this uncontrolled division and lead to a reduction in tumour growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so if you alter it, this is carried through into future generations beyond the time when the drug was administered. These drugs are not specific to neoplastic cells, they potentially affect every cell in the body.<br />A sensitive period refers to a time during which the epigenetic marks in a genome are being re-programmed - ie erased and then replaced.<br />The two crucial sensitive periods of development occur during gametogenesis (primordial germ cell development), and early embryonic development. In gametogenesis, haploid genomes are created through meiosis, and the epigenetic marks are cleared. In early embryonic development, the embryo's epigenetic marks are re-programmed - replaced in a fashion dependent upon allele-specific (ie maternal or paternal) factors.<br />As this time of re-programming involves the use of enzymes (DNA methyltransferase, histone acetylase etc) and other epigenetic modulators (eg non-coding RNA) which are directly inhibited by these epigenetic drugs, there is a chance that epigenetic marks that are essential for life - in the short and long term - may be incorrectly replaced or not placed at all. This could even leave a patient successfully treated for cancer during these sensitive periods at risk of cancer at a later stage in life.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele in the H19/Igf2 cluster is usually methylated, meaning that it silences the promoter for the non-coding RNA H19 and stops its expression, so that enhancers for the expression of Igf2 are expressed, allowing Igf2 expression.<br />The maternal allele in this cluster is usually unmethylated, leading to un-obstructed expression of H19 and prevention of Igf2 expression.<br />In Wilm's tumour, there is a loss of imprinting such that both alleles are methylated, causing over-expression of Igf2 and no expression of H19.<br />The Igf2 gene product (protein) is associated with cellular growth, and over-production of this gene product can contribute to genome-wide instability and uncontrolled cell division, leading to the development of cancer. <br /><br /><br /></div>
