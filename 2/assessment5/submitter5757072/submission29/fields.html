    <div class="field-value">There are two main differences in methylation pattern between cancer and normal cells - local hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island "shores" in tumour suppressor promoters and global hypomethylation of DNA including intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Generally methylation of CpG islands in promoter region cause silencing of gene expression for this gene. In normal cells CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation and small subset of them are dynamically methylated between different cell lines, but mainly they retain unmethylated status. But in cancer cells methylation of CpG islands and their "shores" increase significantly, especially in tumour suppressor genes. This hypermethylation leads to silencing of these genes and to reduction of growth suppression. Another important change is DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In normal cells these regions of DNA are mainly methylated, which silencing them. This is important because usually if this regions unsilenced it might cause genomic instability of cell (deletions, insertions, disrupted recombination, etc.) and also they tend to  have very strong promoter regions which might disrupt normal functionality of genes around them. In normal cells this regions remain silenced even throughout epigenetic reprogramming periods in germ cell development and early embryonic development process. But in cancer cells global level of DNA methylation decreases, including intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which unsilent them and cause genetic instability of tumour cells genome and also change expression of other genes dew to unsilencing of repeats and their strong promoter regions. Hypomethylation  CpG poor promoters in intergenic regions also contribute to cancer because it might result in activation on oncogenes or producing of miRNA that targets tumour suppressors.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">One common difference between tumour and normal cells is loss of imprinting caused by hypo- or hypermethylation of imprint control regions, which might result in loss of expression of growth suppressor genes or overexpression of oncogenes. As example might be H19/Igf2 cluster. In normal cells H19/Igf2 cluster have only one allele of Igf2 gene actively expressed - paternal. Hypermethylation of paternal allele prevent it from binding of CTCF protein, and cluster enhancers can easily activate igf2 gene expression. While in maternal allele this region is unmethylated and bound by CTCF protein which restrict action of enhancers on igf2 gene and they instead activate another more closely located gene H19, while igf2 gene remains silent. In Wilm's tumour there are both alleles, maternal and paternal, that are hypermethylated which restricts binding of CTCF protein and enhancers activate expression of igf2 from both alleles. As igf2 gene product is growth promoting this double dosage of it from both maternal and paternal alleles cause carcinogenic effect and tumourogenesis.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents which means that it causes demethylation of DNA. This might be important in curing types of cancer that related to hypermethylation of CpG islands in oncosuppressor genes promoters. The main aims of Decitabine are DNA methyl transferases (DNMT1 generally) and this drug inhibit them preventing DNA methylation. The inhibition of DNMT1 by Decitabine is division dependant because when DNMT1 binds DNA to make methylation it binds by drug irreversibly. This division dependency is important because in this case drug affect only cells that replicating rapidly to which tumour cells are belong to.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation
might have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because they modify epigentetic marks such as DNA methylation which are mitotically heritable. This mean that once get changed they might remain unchanged in next populations of cells in tumour until
 they are actively erased. However epigenetic aimed drugs might be unacceptable for treatment of some patients that are in epigenetically sensitive period. This sensitive periods are periods of active erasing and re-establishing of epigenetic marks during germ cell development (younger patients) or early embryonic development (pregnant patients) when cells are very sensitive to epigenetic modifying factors. Treating such patients during sensitive periods might be inadvisable because it may cause long-lasting changes in their epigenom, that might have consequences in later life, and might cause a wide range of diseases related to disturbance in their epigenetic state. It also might affect not only these patient under treatment but also their children and other generations, if they will have any.<br /></div>
