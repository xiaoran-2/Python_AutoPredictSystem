    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">     Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands involves tumor suppressor genes, such as those involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis and DNA repair.CIMP(CpG island methylator phenotype), resulting in hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands, was first discovered in colorectal cancers. The hypermethylation of these CpG islands results in the silencing of the various genes involved in tumor suppression, hence leading to cancer growth.  Examples of the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements include sncRNA and lncRNA.  In addition to being involved in  assembly, etc. of tRNA, rRNA, miRNA, the lncRNA have important tasks in regulatory functions of gene expression, localizing target DNA sequences, association with chromatin remodelling complexes, and are required for pluripotency and differentiation. An example of DNA methylation in a lncRNA region includes  the p53-induced lncRNA PANDA
 and MEG3. PANDA delimits apoptosis
 by inhibiting a nuclear transcription 
factor responsible for activating genes related to apoptosis. Hense, cells do not die and continue to grow.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Paternal allele is not expressed, due to methylation, and H19/Igf2 are closely related, etc.  The maternal allele is usually hypomethylated or unmethylated, leading to expression, etc.  <br /><br /><br />Sigh...out of time...:)  Sorry.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of  hypomethylating inhibitors.  It inhibits DNA methyltransferase, thus leading to hypomethylation, reducing problems of hypermethlation.  As a cytosine analog, it is involved in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia, i.e. cancer of white blood cells), etc.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Enduring effects occured due to the removal of the epigenetic drugs, yet the tumors were then much more susceptible to regular chemotherapy treatment, indicating a lasting effect of the DNA methylation effects.  Sensitive periods involve DNA replication, transcription, tranlation, etc. during the periods of cell division, mitosis, and during cell growth, etc.  These sensitive periods of development would include both pre and post embryonic development, etc.  It would be inadvisable to treat patients who are pregnant, due to the rapid growth and cell division occurring during development of the embryo, fetus, etc., due to the lasting epigenic effects.<br /></div>
