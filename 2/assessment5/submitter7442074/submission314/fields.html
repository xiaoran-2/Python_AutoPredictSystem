    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">- Most of the CpG islands are demethylated in normal cells ensuring that the genes located at the locus are transcribed. The methyl groups on CpG islands prevent binding of transcribtion factors to the promoter leading to inhibited gene expression at these sites.<br />- Cancer is associated with an global hypomethylation resulting in an increased instability. Some specific gene promoters are hypermethylated leading to decreased transcription of tumor suppressor genes. <br />- The disruption in CpG island methylation leads to genomic instability and abolishing of the control in essential processes including cell repair, cell division and prober differentiation leading to uncontrolled differentiation and mutagenesis. <br />- In intergenic and repetitive element methyl groups are securing that transcription is kept low to prevent genomic instability <br />- The methyl groups are lost, due to the global hypomethylation pattern seen in relation to cancer<br />- Disruption of DNA methylation at these elements will provoke deletions, translocations and insertions which contribute to tumorigenesis<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">- at the paternal allele H19 is not expressed since methylation of ICR prevent the binding of CTCF and thus inhibiting the enhancers to the this region. Igf2 is expressed since the enhancers are mediating the transcription of this gene site<br />- the maternal ICR is not methylated allowing the binding of CTCF which blocks for the activity of the enhancer on the Igf2 promoter, preventing the expression of Igf2<br />- In Wilm's tumor the maternal allele is expressing the Igf2 just like the paternal <br />- When the Igf2 is transcribed and thus produced in excess it provokes uncontrolled cell division leading to tumorigenesis</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">- DNMT inhibitor<br />- Decitabine decrease DNA methylation <br />-Decitabine can prevent the inhibition of tumor suppressor gene expression and thereby prevent tumorigenesis</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">- the epigenetic methylation marks induced by enzymatic modifiers are thought to be stable and furthermore mitotically inheritable which ensures that the daughter cells comprise the same anti-tumor properties as the treated cells<br />- the sensitive periods are phases in the lifespan of an individual where the epigenetic marking is being reprogrammed<br />- the embryonic period subsequent to fertilization is an sensitive period. Likewise is there a sensitive phase in the gametogenesis where the mature gametes are made. <br />- Treating of patients during these periods (e.g. treating of young females, which oocytes are not fully mature or pregnant women) could potentially disrupt the normal epigenetic resetting process and provoke some critical consequences. This would might induce epigenetic-dependend gene mutations leading to abnormal cell behavior</div>
