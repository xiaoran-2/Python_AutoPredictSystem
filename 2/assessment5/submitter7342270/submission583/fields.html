    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark passed on to daughter cells through mitosis, needed for proper differensiation, embyonic developement and imprinting and X-inactivation[1]. DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with silencing of gene expression, this is due to CpG islands most often being in the transcription start areas - the promotor regions.[3] CpG islands in normal human tissue tend to be unmethylated so genes can be expressed / avalible, not every gene is expressed in every tissue, so different promoters are methylated to achive cell differentiation and specialised tissues. Also, in normal genome the intragenetic regions, introns and the repetetive elements are methylated to maintain genomic integrity and stability, and to avoid transcriptional interferens from strong promotors[3]. <br />In cancer however, hypermethylation of specific loci and genomewide hypomethylation is the new normal. CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated and the intragenic regions, introns and repetetive elements are hypomethylated[1], opposite from the normal tissue. The pattern of which genes and regions that are silenced/activated differ from tumor types[1]. DNA methylation of the promotors for tumor suppresor genes, is one way the cancer silence the genes that are controlling cell cycle, apoptosis, growth and DNA repair[1,2]. The unmethylation of the repetetive elements, intragenic regions and introns is responsible for the genomic instability, through unmethylation the repetetive elements are free to jump around and lay down places where they interfere the coding of a gene, making it aberrant; silenced or increasing the expression, you may get deletion, insertion, reciprocal translocation and illegitimate recombination[3] - you get chaos. DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark, but epimutation, which methylation in cancer is, is still reversible and thereby able to change during the progress of cancer - it is often increasing over time. <br /><br />References [1]Hassler MR(2012)Biochimie, 94(11):2219-30 [2]The Economist,Cancer's epicentre(2012,7th April)[3] Marnie Blewitt,Epigenetic control of gene expression</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting is is the methylation pattern of parental allele laid down during the primordial germ cell development[3].Gene expression in a parental-of-origin manner is controlled by the Imprint Control Region (ICR)[3]. In the cluster of H19/Igf2, the ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated acting as an insulator binding the protein CTCF, thereby blocking the downstream enhancers of H19 from activating the Igf2, thus H19 is activated; the growth inhibitor gene is expressed. Methylation of the ICR at the paternal allele prevents the CTCF from binding, now the downstream enhancer of H19(paternally imprinted) can induce activation of the Igf2 growth promoting gene[3]. <br />Hypo-/hypermethylation of the ICR might lead to loss of imprinting, thereby alteration in the expression of these genes. Regarding the Wilm's tumor,  the imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted due to DNA methylation of the ICR at the maternal allele, thereby the maternal allele behave like the paternal allele, leading to overexpression of Igf2 and no expression of H19[3] Igf2, an oncogene promoting growth - in Wilm's tumor the cancer cell produce twice the amount of what is normal and no growth inhibiting gene is expressed due to the silencing of  H19 by the methylation of it's ICR.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-methyl-transferase(DNMT)inhibitor; a demethylating drug used to treat MDS[2,3]. DNMT is an enzyme that catalyze the transfer of a methylgroup to DNA by using SAM as the methyl donor, thereby maintaining the DNA methylation pattern in the genome[3]. Opposite, the DNMTinhibitor is a cytidine analogue that is unmethylable and tricking the DNA to become incorporated into the DNA upon replication, causing hypomethylation by inhibiting the DNMT enzyme from methylating the DNA[4]. For every cell division the DNA methylation is diluted since the DNMT no longer repaire the hemimethylated daugther strands[3]. The hypomethylation of the promotors leads to expression of tumor suppressor genes and anti-tumor effect.<br />References [4] Kantarjin H et al,Cancer 106(1794-1803)(april2006)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNAmethylation is a stable epigenetic mark that is inherited mitotically throughout life[1], even maybe transgenerationally. By altering the methylation profile through nutrition, medication or environment different (wrong) genes might be switched on /off leading to devastating (epigenetic) effects. The approved drugs discussed in the article are incorporated into the DNA irreversibly and might cause mutation in daugther cells, the drugs also might erase epigenetic marks[2]. The mechanism of these drugs cause increased genomic instability due to the unspecific hypomethylation, the long term effect on normal cells are unknown. Therefore these drug might not be wise to use at young or pregnant patients nor other that are in a epigenetic sensitive period of life. During embryonic developement, PGC and close-to-pubertal (sperm)developement environmental changes(as drugs) might have extreme and unknown effects on the cells.<br />Particularly vulnerable is the epigenetic machinery during sensitive periods when the epigenome is reprogrammed, when the epigenetic marks are being established[3]; especially in the first 1000 days of life. This is paricularly during the early development of the embryo, when the primordial germ cells(PGC) are produced, during tissue differentiation - which mainly last till the age of two, but still throughout life youe have cell differentiation and tissue renewal.</div>
