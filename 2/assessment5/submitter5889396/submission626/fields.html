    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal DNA methylation at CpG islands is essential for
normal development and associated with X inactivation, genomic imprinting, and
suppression of repetitive elements; however it is rare in normal cells.  Abnormal DNA methylation at CpG islands has
been recognized as a component of cancer development, since it represses
transcription of the associated gene, this has been said to act as one “hit” in
the Knudsen two-hit hypothesis for tumour progression, where more than one “hit
or mutation” is needed for a tumour to develop.</p>

<p>Hypermetylation usually occurs at CpG islands in the
promoter regions, causing silencing or inactivation of the gene, usually occurs
for tumour suppressor genes, whereas hypomethylation occurs in oncogenes,
causing them to be expressed at higher levels. 
The function of normal methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic
regions was proposed to be a cause of the spread of parasitic elements as
genomes became larger and the danger to maintain genome integrity from
unrestrained transposition events increased. 
These regions are hypomethylated in most cancers which in fact results
in an increased transcription of transposable elements causing genome
instability and therefore causing cancer. 
DNA methylation changes directly contribute to tumourogenesis and
detection of these changes can be used for early diagnosis or better prognosis
for the patient.</p><p><a href="http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v10/n1/full/5200768a.html#bib87">http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v10/n1/full/5200768a.html#bib87</a>  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The importance of specific DNA methylation patterns come
from the imprinting loci, they come from either the maternal or paternal
alleles. These allele-specific patterns of methylation direct allele
specific-expression.   Loss of imprinting
of IGF2 and H19, have been associated with tumourogenesis.</p><p>

</p><p>IGF2 is normally transcribed from the paternal allele (P),
while H19 is transcribed from the maternal allele (M).  Imprinting expression of these genes is
regulated by an imprinting centre which is unmethylated in the(M), and methylated
in the (P).  The imprinting centre
contains CTCF binding sites to which CTCF binds when unmethylated (M).  When it binds, it blocks the activity of the
enhancer elements located downstream of H19 and therefore, restricts activity
only to the H19 expression.   Methylation
of the CTCF binding sites in the (P), prevents CTCF to bind and allows the
enhancer to active IGF2 expression.  In
Wilm’s tumour, Biallelic expression of the CTCF binding sites results in IGF2
overexpression, causing abnormal cell growth, therefore contributing to
cancer.  Loss of imprinting (LOI) on the
maternal chromosome, could occur independently or could be influenced by other
events in the paternal chromosome, LOI of IGF2 is linked to reduced expression
and abnormal methylation of H19 in Wilm’s tumours.</p><p><a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/model-of-loss-of-imprinting-of-igf2-38079" title="Link: http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/model-of-loss-of-imprinting-of-igf2-38079">http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/model-of-loss-of-imprinting-of-igf2-38079</a> <br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many genes involved in cancer go through a genetic regulation
called epigenetics.  This turns silence
or activates genes by either involving their DNA or the clusters involved. </p>

<p>Decibatine (Dacogen) is a drug used for the treatment of
myelodysplastic syndromes, where certain blood cells are dysfunctional and also
used for acute myeloid leukemia.  Decitabine
is a  DNA-Demethylating agent or hypomethylating
agent, which hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltrasnferases.   Epigenetic
changes done using epigenetic drugs, are passed on during cells divisions to
daughters cells until they are actively erased.   Once erased, they won’t return.  After being treated with this drug, genes
previously silenced by hypermethylation, could be re-expressed leading to
normal cell cycle control, differentiation and apoptotic pathways, therefore
contributing to an anti-cancer effect of the drug.</p><p><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">http://www.economist.com/node/21552168</a> <br /></p><p><a href="https://www.dovepress.com/azacitidine-and-decitabine-have-different-mechanisms-of-action-in-non--peer-reviewed-article-LCTT-recommendation1" title="Link: https://www.dovepress.com/azacitidine-and-decitabine-have-different-mechanisms-of-action-in-non--peer-reviewed-article-LCTT-recommendation1">https://www.dovepress.com/azacitidine-and-decitabine-have-different-mechanisms-of-action-in-non--peer-reviewed-article-LCTT-recommendation1</a> <br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><pre><code></code></pre><p>When treating cells with a epigenetic drugs, these epigenetic changes caused will be passed onto daughter and granddaughter cells during
cell division until the abnormal cells are actively erased.  After they are erased, they won’t come back
and therefore will prevent cancer growing in the future cells. </p>

<p>A sensitive period is a period of reprogramming where
epigenetic marks are being set.  It can
program genes through DNA methylation, namely the prenatal period, or
transition between life-history phases.  This period can trigger functional changes in
genes without altering the DNA sequence itself and are often over-lasting.   During sensitive periods, it is preferable to
avoid using epigenetic drugs in patients, because they are undergoing a period
of many epigenetics changes where epigenetic marks are being set and the plasticity
may make this period more susceptible to external and environmental
influences, which may not be favourable for the patient at that specific moment.  These drugs should be used only when necessary and completely sure of the treatment wanted. </p><p><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">http://www.economist.com/node/21552168</a> <br /></p></div>
