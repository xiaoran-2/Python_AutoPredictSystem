    <div class="field-value">In cancer cells, DNA methylation is mainly altered in two ways: hypermethylation at CpG islands, and hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. <br /><br />Normally, DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to silencing of expression of the corresponding gene. In cancer cells, CpG islands are usually hypermethylated, or higher methylation level as compared to normal cells. This would result in the silencing of tumor suppressor gene, thus leading to the loss of tumor suppression and prosperity of tumor growth.<br /><br />On the other hand, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements aims to maintain genomic integrity. However, in cancer cells, these regions are hypomethylated, or lowered methylation level as compared to normal cells, leading to raised genomic instability. For example, the hypomethylation would result in change of chromatin structure and lead to abnormal recombination between repeats. It also affects the stability of repeats by making them transposable. Furthermore, the hypomethylation can also activate cryptic promoters thus interfering with the expression of genes nearby. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On paternal allele, imprinting control region is methylated, so the enhancer would work on lgf2 to make it expressed. On the other hand, the imprinting control region on maternal allele is not methylated, thus it would be bound by CTCF and the enhancers would work on H19 to make it expressed, so lgf2 won't be expressed. <br />In Wilm's tumour case, imprinting control regions on both alleles are both methylated, thus we have a loss of imprinting and CTCF is not bound to neither one of the alleles. Therefore, we have double dose expression of lgf2 due to absence of CTCF, which would promote cell growth and is always found in Wilm's tumour. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine primarily beongs to DNMT inhibitors, drugs targeting DNA methyltransferase. Like other DNMTi's, while the cell is dividing and DNA is replicating, decitabine, as n<span>ucleoside analogues, gets incorporated into DNA. Later, decitabine would bind strongly to DNMTs and thus inhibit their function. One thing worth noticing is that DNMTi only works when the cell is dividing. Given the fact that tumor cells are famous for its rapid replication, it would suffer the most from such DNMT inhibition effects and got killed due to dysfunction. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In some cases, like loss of imprinting or gain of extra imprinting, altered DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, thus making cells from all tissues sharing the same altered epigenetic states. Such inheritable DNA methylation alteration usually happen during a sensitive period, which is a period of development of the organism that is significantly more susceptible to stress, like cancer drug treatments. So if the drug is applied during sensitive periods, such drug treatment would have large effect on nearly all the cells because they are all naturally susceptible to the drug. Thus, the drug would have much lowered specificity to cancers, and would kill normal cells as well. Or in worse case, cause abnormality in human.</div>
