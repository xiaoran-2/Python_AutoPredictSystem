    <h1>Submission 718 from Anon (session_user_id: 1a47cb37f0a6fd00c89a222c1022e41edb21d7a8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is one of the FDA approved drugs used to treat cancer and especially myelodysplastic syndrome. It belongs to the class of the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors. By blocking DNMTs it essentially causes DNA hypomethylation and thus switches on genes that are methylated. In the case of cancer, genes that are involved in the control of cell growth and division may be turned on by this occurring DNA demethylation leading to tumour suppression as they block the uncontrolled growth and division that are normally observed in cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands is one of the mechanisms of gene silencing. Most CpG islands are unmethylated at any stage of development and allow the expression of that particular gene, if the appropriate transcription factors are present and the chromatin structure is accessible to them. The ones that are methylated, form a repressive chromatin structure through binding of MeCPs and by prohibiting the binding of transcription factors they change the expression of certain genes. In almost every cancer type there has been described hypermethylation of CpG islands. This increased methylation in the CpG islands located in gene promoters can be explained by an analogous increase of DNMT1 and DNMT3b methyltransferases which is also observed during cancer. When the CpG island hypermethylation occurs in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes they become silenced, resulting in the progression of cancer. On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in the normal cell are usually methylated. This methylation helps to ensure genomic integrity through silencing of cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites, silencing of repeats to prevent transposition and interference from strong promoters as well as illegitimate recombination. Conversely, in cancer those intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hypomethylated resulting in genomic instability and the occurrence of illegitimate recombination between repeats. That may lead to deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations all of which can disrupt tumour suppressing genes. Moreover, transposition and activation of cryptic promoters can interfere with neighbouring genes switching them on and resulting in over expression of oncogenes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>The H19/Igf2 cluster is controlled by methylation patterns. On the paternal allele, the methylated imprinting control region (ICR) blocks the binding of CTCF and so the downstream enhancers can promote the transcription of Igf2. On the maternally inherited allele, the ICR is unmethylated and so it is bound by the CTCF. CTCF then acts as an insulator for the downstream enhancers which now cannot promote the Igf2 expression. They can, however, access the H19 gene and elicit its transcription. As a result, Igf2 is only expressed by the paternal allele whereas H19 is only expressed by the maternal allele. In Wilm's tumour this paternal imprinting for Igf2 is disrupted. The maternal allele is also methylated in the ICR region and so Igf2 is expressed maternally as well, increasing the amount of Igf2 that is produced by a cell. Igf2 is a well-known growth factor and so excess amounts stimulate the growth of tumour cells aiding the progression of cancer. </span><span><br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes, such as alteration of DNA methylation, are mitotically transmitted to all the daughter cells and so they can persist for a long period of time depending on the cell type and the developmental stage at which this epigenetic change occurred. Developmental stages during which epigenetic reprogramming takes place are considered sensitive periods, since changes made to the epigenetic patterns can have lasting adverse effects. Sensitive periods of development in mammals are during the pre-implantation and during the development of progenitor germ cells, in both of which time points, the parental epigenetic marks are erased. Treating patients with epigenome altering drugs during those periods is certainly inadvisable since those changes would affect not only the developing organism but can also have trans-generational effects in cases of pregnant women. Effects that may include developmental abnormalities, various health problems and even cancer.</div>
