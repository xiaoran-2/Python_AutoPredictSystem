    <div class="field-value"><br />DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating tissue-specific gene expression. It is also involved in the establishment and maintenance of genomic imprinting and X inactivation, and in the regulation of chromosome stability. Alterations in DNA methylation have been associated with cancer and several other diseases.  Tumour suppressor genes are often silenced in cancer cells due to hypermethylation. In contrast, the genomes of cancer cells have been shown to be hypomethylated overall when compared to normal cells, . <br /><br />CpG islands are normally not methylated in normal cells, in cancer cells CpG islands are more commonly methylated.   CpG islands are commonly found in the promoters of genes, the methylation of these sequences can lead to inappropriate gene silencing, such as the silencing of tumour suppressor genes in cancer cells. This silencing allows the tumour to progress and spread. Also, epigenetic defects in DNA repair genes are frequent in cancers.<br /><br />Genome wide hypomethylation is also associated with cancer, in the normal cells the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated, which helps maintain genomic stability, these regions show decreased methylation in cancer which leads to genomic instability as transposition and illegitimate recombination can now occur.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span><br />Approximately 25 imprinted genes have been identified to date, and disregulation of a number of these has been implicated in tumour development, Alterations in DNA methylation at imprint control regions can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and over expression of growth promoting genes. One example of this is the over expression of Igf2 in Wilms tumour.<br /></span><br />In normal cells, the paternal IGF2 and maternal H19 genes are expressed  Several sites upstream of H19 are methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. <br /><br />In Wilms tumour the imprinting is lost, so, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth because of the double dose of IGF2 which is growth promoting.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />Decitabine is an enzymatic epigenetic regulator,  it is a DMNT inhibitor, DNMT inhibitors irreversibly bind DMNTs after they are incorporated into the DNA and are therefore replication dependent, because this is the case, cancer cells are more severely affected as the replication and divide rapidly. <br /><br />At a low dose decitabine induces hypomethylation, which promotes the re-expression of tumour suppressor genes, as well as the suppression of tumour growth.. At the moment Decitabine is only used in Myleodysplastic syndrome.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />Epigenetic drugs that alter methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased, <span>Once erased they do not return. Dr Baylin speculated that it might be the case that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</span><br /><br />if a person is exposed to a drug during a period of epigenetic reprogramming (sensitive periods), it could have serious effects,  these sensitive periods of development are early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. In these periods the epigenetic marks are established. It would be inadvisable to treat patients during these periods because it could interfere with the reprogramming cycle.. Based on this it would be inadvisable to treat women during pregnancy for example, as this would not only affect her and her fetus, but also the next generation.<br /><br />Also, in younger patients the effects on the germ cells need to be considered.</div>
