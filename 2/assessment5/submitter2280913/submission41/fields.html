    <div class="field-value">'CpG' represents cytosine and guanine nucleotides separated by a phosphate.  The cysteine in CpG dinucleotides can be methylated;which from an evolutionary standpoint has generally resulted in a significant reduction in CpG occurrence over expectation due to deamination of the methylated cytosine converting it to thymine.  An exception to this are CpG islands which are found in a one to two kilobase region at the initiation end of a protein transcription region. In normal cells, CpG sites in mammalian cells are highly methylated in distributed sites such as repetitive elements, exons, satellite DNA, and intergenic DNA; and hypomethylated at CpG islands.  Methylation generally serves to suppress the associated function.<br />Cancer cells exhibit genome-wide hypomethylation of distributed CpG sites and local methylation of CpG islands and shores. Methylation of CpG islands generally induces silencing of the associated gene; genes which may include tumor suppression capability.  Genome-wide demethylation of distributed CpG sites results in genomic instability.  The loss of tumor suppression capability combined with the heterogeneity and rapid relative evolution of tumor cells due to genomic instability give tumors a competitive advantage over normal cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Maternal and paternal imprint control regions can be disrupted by tumorigenesis  either through hypomethylation or hypermethylation.  Growth-related regions of the paternal and maternal alleles are major imprint targets and disruption can lead to reduction in expression of growth repressors and overexpression of growth promotors.<br />Normal expression of the H19/lgf2 cluster occurs with a base configuration of methylation of a CTCF binding site - resulting in no CTCF binding -on the paternal allele and an unmethylated CTCF binding site - resulting in CTCF binding -  on the maternal allele.  The paternal allele will normally express lgf2 in the presence of promotors with no H19 expression.  The maternal allel will not express lgf2 in the presence of promotors, but will express H19.<br />Cancer disrupts this methylation pattern by methylating (hypermethylation) the maternal CTCF binding site on the maternal allele...so that both the maternal and paternal alleles express lgf2 and no H19 is expressed in the presence of enhancers.  An observed result is Wilm's tumors on the kidney.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent.  The mechanism according to DrugBank is decitabine converion to decitabine triphosphate which is incorporated into DNA and inhibits binding of the enzyme DNA methyltransferase.  This action specifically inhibits maintenance of methylization of CpG islands which is a hallmark of cancer cells.  Decitabine is observed to have its greatest impact on the cell cycle; restoring normal cell cycle functionality including apotosi and therefore cellular mortality.Decitabine is approved by the FAA for specific application to myelodysplastic syndrome progressed to AML</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Economist quote is specific to the combined use of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine, which goes by the name of Vidaza.  Vidaza is an FDA-approved that in low doses acts to inhibit DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzyme action resulting in hypomethylation in the target cells.  The resulting methylation profile in the cancer cells is preserved during mitosis; therefore the impact of the DNMT inhibitor (DNMTi) can be preserved well after initial dosing.  Clinically it is observed that the DNMTi induced hypomethylation improves response to chemotherapy.<br />Assumedly the alteration of the methylation profile by DNMTi is not necessarily specific to cancer cells.  A concern ids that the this could have a long-term impact on patient health; since the epigenetic changes would be preserved for impacted somatic cells during mitosis.  This is of minimal concern for older cancer patients since the concern is with increasing longevity and quality of life.  <br />In younger patients there is a concern that epigenetic modification of during sensitive periods through DNMTi action could result in permanent and deleterious epigenetic changes.  Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic imprinting and reprogramming and specifically occur during pre-implantation development and mid-gestation gametogenesis.  </div>
