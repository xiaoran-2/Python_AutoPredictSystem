    <div class="field-value">In cancer cells, there are changes in DNA methylation which could be a genome-wide loss of DNA methylation or DNA methylation at certain regions in the genome. These events could promote genomic instability and disrupt regulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes. Unfortunately, Altered DNA methylation patterns could leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes which eventually causes cancers. 

DNA methylation at CpG islands is playing important roles in gene silencing e.g., X-chormosome inactivation and imprinting genes. However, the promoters of CpG islands are tend to become hypermethylated in cancer cells and the consequence is silencing of underlying genes. The hypermethylation at CpG rich sites is also known as CIMP and it could leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes eventually loss of regulation of cell cycle/division which is commonly the cause of cancers.  

Similarly, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated so that genomic stability could be maintained i.e., prevent reciprocal translocations between repeats, prevent the activation of cryptic promoters or repeats. Unfortunately, hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements could happen and it promotes genomic instability which is commonly found in individuals with cancers. This is because hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements can actually promote illegitamate recombination between the repetitive elements, activate the repeats and transposition, or promote activation of cryptic promoters which could eventually deactivate tumor suppressor genes. The outcomes are disrupted regulation of cell cycle/division which promotes cancers.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In paternal allele, DNA methylation occurs at ICR of H19/Igf2 cluster blocks binding of CTCF eventually methylation at H19 promoter. Enhancers are now able to gain access to Igf2 and expression of Igf2 could happen. In maternal allele, no DNA methylation at ICR of H19/Igf2 cluster. This allows the insulator protein (CTCF) to bind to the ICR and insulates Igf2 from downstream of enhancers. Expression of Igf2 in maternal allele is silenced. 

Wilm's tumour is predispose to embryonic or childhood tumours. It could be resulted from mutation or deletion of ICR of H19/Igf2 cluster, paternal uniparental disomy, or epigenetic disruption for loss of imprinting. All these events can increase the expression of Igf2 in both alleles which eventually keep on promoting growth. This loss of imprinting is a known feature of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent which can demethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Therefore, this drug has the potency in reactivating epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes. This could results in reactivation of cell cycle/growth regulation and stop tumour cells from dividing i.e. anti-tumour effect. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can directly causes epigenetic changes in the DNA genome. It is because epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, drugs that affect DNA methylation could have extended period beyond the period of drug treatment until the effects are actively erased.

However, it is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods which are the time periods when clearing and reprogramming of epigenetic marks happen. These sensitive periods are fall in early embryonic development period and primordial germ cell development period. The consequences of treating patients during sensitive periods are disruptions of epigenetic reprogramming and eventually result in epigenetic abnormalities such as imprinting disorders.</div>
