    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span><i>DNA methylation at CpG islands</i><br /></span>Normal cells often find 5mC -The modification of the C5 position of cytosine base- at CpG islands in somatic mammalian cells (not find in embryonic stem cells). In cancer cells ,DNA methylation at CpG islands led the normal cells hypermethylated by silencing tumour suppressor genes to change normal cells to  cancer cells. These events base on  correlation between 5mC and CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype). When the normal cells turn to the cancer cells ,5mC will decrease and CIMP will increase inversely.<br /><br /><i>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements</i><br />In normal cells , intergenic regions and repetitive elements is always methylated so the cells can work normally but when intergenic regions and repetitive elements become to hypomethlated , gene won't express.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells , there are only one allele (from 2 alleles -one from father and another from mother) that is not methylated because  CTCF binds at the sequence between enhancers and promoters so <i>H19</i> express by enhancers enhances these gene. And another allele hasn't CTCF binding so the same site is methylated and enhancers will enhance<i> Igf2 </i>to express.<br />In Wilm’s tumour, two allele (all maternal allele and paternal allele) are expressed. At the sequence between enhancers and promoters are methylated (none of CTCF's binding) so enhancers enhance<i> Igf2 </i>to express. But it is overexpression of Igf2-growth promoter- so normal cells are activated to increase cells(over divided cells) and become to  <span>Wilm’s tumour.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>The class of epigenetic inhibitors<br />1.DNA-demethylating agents are used to heal the old patients from myelodysplastic syndromes -abnormal of bone marrows don't produce red blood cells ,white</span> blood cells and platelets- that will severe to become AML -Acute myelogenous leukemia.<span><br />2.Histone-deacetylase inhibitors </span>are used to heal the rare patients from cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.<br /><span><br />Decitabine on DNA methylation<br /></span>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent that can inhibit DNA methylation by inhibits DNA methyltransferase. It is a Cystidine analog. and can be <span>incorporated into DNA strands </span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">At the cell division from mother cells to daughter cells -in same body,they are eliminated and they cannot return to dividing other cells again. So that the cancer cells can't growth.<br /><br /><span>A sensitive period means the time that the cancer growth after the patients eat drugs.<br /></span><br />Because cancer drugs are so virulent , they can made the side effects to everyone who eat them.</div>
