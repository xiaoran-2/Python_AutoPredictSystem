    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is essential for development and chromosomal stability.  Methylation occurs in the cytosine preceeding the guanine in CpG sites and CpG island in the promoter region of genes tend to be unmethylated, In cancer cells, amount of methylated cytosine is less leading to global hypomethylation while CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated. Hypermethylation of CpG islands silences the tumour suppressor genes.  Intergenic regions and repetitive sequences are usually methylated.  Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive sequences has been reported in cancer cells and hypomethylation leads to genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific  and imprinted genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The maternally-expressed H19 gene and paternally-expressed Igf2 gene share enhancers. The imprint control region (ICR) in maternal allele is unmethylated allowing the binding of  CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) leading to blocking of  enhancers from binding to IgF2. On the paternal chromosome, methylation at the ICR prevents CTCF from binding, allowing Igf2 to engage the enhancers thereby silencing the H19.Thus IgF2 in maternal allele and H19 in paternal allele is silenced. Loss of imprinting (LOI) in maternal allele makes it behave like paternal allele leading to increased expression of IgF2 while loss of imprinting in paternal allele leads to increaded expression of H19. Since IgF2 is an growth factor, its increased expression leads to uncontrolled cell growth.  LOI has been found to be the significant genetic alteration in wilms tumour. aberrant H19 expression can be involved in Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome, as well as Silver-Russell syndrome (Source: Wikipedia)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is sold in the trade name as Dacogen by a Japanese company, Eisai. Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methylation by reducing or inhibiting the action of DNA methyl transferase. Hypomethylation of critical genessuch as tumor suppressor genes resulting from the acton of Decibatine restores their normal function and lead to the control of cell growth (Source: Cancer’s epicentre from The Economist and FDA)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark and passed on to subsequent generation of cells, drugs altering DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of treatment. However, reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during gametogenesis and during fertilization. Hence it is not advisable to treat patients during sensitive periods such as during puberty and during pregnancy with drugs that alter DNA methylation.</div>
