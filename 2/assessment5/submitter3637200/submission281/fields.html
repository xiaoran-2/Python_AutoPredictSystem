    <div class="field-value"><p>·      
Describe the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands. CpG
islands are normally not methylated so that tumor suppressor genes are promoted
and expressed.</p>

<p>·      
Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in
cancer. In cancer, the CpG islands become methylated and suppress the promotion
and expression of tumor suppressor genes. 
</p>

<p>·      
Explain how disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands (CPI) contributes
to cancer. CPI hypermethylation is mitotically heritable and these cells grow
rapidly thus preferentially selecting for the epimutation. </p>

<p>·      
Describe the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic
regions and repetitive elements. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements
are normally methylated which helps to maintain genomic stability. </p>

<p>·      
Describe how DNA methylation in intergenic regions and
repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer. Hypomethylation of the intergenic
regions and repetitive elements occurs in cancer. This is a progressive process over time. Hypomethylation increases with increasing cell age and increasing age of the organism. </p>

<p>·      
Explain how disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions
and repetitive elements contributes to cancer. This progressive hypomethylation disrupts heterochromatin in areas of the genome with DNA
repeats. These areas are then open (euchromatin) and active and involved in recombinations
between different chromosomes causing reciprocal translocations. These active
repetitive elements can also result in chromosome repeats and deletions.
Finally, cryptic promoters may be activated causing expression of normally
silenced genes. The end result is genomic instability and cancer development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>·      
Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how
this determines Igf2 expression status.  The imprint control region
is methylated in the paternal allele. The enhancers will act to cause
expression of Ig2 but not H19.</p>

<p>·      
Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how
this determines Igf2 expression status.  The imprint control region
is unmethylated in the maternal allele. CTCF will thus bind to the imprint
control region, insulating Igf2, and allowing H19 to be activated by the enhancers.
Igf2 will not be expressed. </p>

<p>·      
Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in
Wilm’s tumour. In Wilm’s tumor the maternal imprint control region is also
methylated so there is “double dose” of Igf2. </p>

<p>·      
Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster
contributes to cancer. Igf2 is a growth promoter and therefore the increased dose from maternal expression of Igf2 results in promotion of  tumor growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br /></p>

<p><span>·      
</span>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine
belongs to.  Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent that inhibits
DNA methyltransferase. </p>

<p><span>·      
</span>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation. Decitabine
will reduce methylation of DNA including, theoretically, CpG island methylation. </p>

<p><span>·      
</span><span>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumor
effect.   When CpG islands are demethylated tumor suppressing genes
are promoted.  Decitabine can have an
anti-tumor effect by reducing epigenomic methylation at CpG islands thus expression
of these tumor suppressing genes can resume.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>·      
</span>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects
on the epigenome. DNA methylation is an epigenomic phenomenon which is mitotically heritable and thus a relatively
stable epigenomic change in the organism. Because of this stability drugs that alter DNA methylation
may have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment or exposure.</p>

<p><span>·      
</span>Define what is meant by a sensitive period. A sensitive
period is a time of extensive epigenetic reprogramming in an organism. </p>

<p><span>·      
</span>Identify sensitive periods of development. Two sensitive
periods of development are primordial germ cell maturation and early embryonic
development. </p>

<p><span>·      
</span><span>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be
inadvisable. The epigenome is important in gene expression and genomic
stability. Drugs that disrupt, change or interfere with normal epigenetic reprogramming
can thus have far reaching adverse consequences for the normal development of
the organism. </span></p></div>
