    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA
methylation occurs almost exclusively at CpG dinucleotides and most CpG
sequences in the genome are methylated. DNA methylation is catalyzed by a
family of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes. However, there are CpG islands associated with gene promoters
that escape DNA methylation. </p><p>Active
genes tend to be enriched with special changes whereas inactive genes have different specific enrichments. DNA methylation was the first epigenetic alteration to
be observed in cancer cells. </p>

<p>Hypermethylation
events on usually unmethylated CpG islands are set up in a large number of
cancer genes. Hypermethylation of CpG islands at tumour suppressor genes
switches off these genes, whereas global hypomethylation leads to genome
instability and inappropriate activation of oncogenes and transposable
elements. </p>

<p>DNA
methylation is also the principal epigenetic factor governing allelic
imprinting or the process by which only one allele of certain factors is
expressed depending on the parental origin.</p>

<p>DNA
methylation levels, which are maintained by DNMT enzymes, delicately balance
within cells, and over-expression of DNMTs is linked to cancer in humans. Most
genes that involve DNA methylation levels affect histone modifications. H3K9
methylation and DNA methylation are associated. Moreover, in cancer cells,
disruption of DNA methylation is linked to loss of H4K20 methylation. </p>

<span>A gene remembers whether it was inherited from the father or the mother
and is expressed accordingly.  DNA methylation is part of this memory
process and loss of imprinting has been tightly linked to cancer
susceptibility. For instance, the Igf2
gene is an imprinted gene that is shown only from paternally-inherited alleles.
However, aberrant methylation of the<i> </i>Igf2
imprinting control region on the maternal allele leads to the additional
expression of the maternal copy. Therefore, the points of the Igf2 rise approximately twofold and this
elevated level may be linked to cancer susceptibility. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In
normal cells, the paternal Igf2 and
maternal H19 genes are expressed.
Several sites upstream of H19 are
methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.</span></p>

<p><span>With loss
of imprinting, the maternal chromosome reverses to a
paternal epigenotype, and with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, Igf2 turned on, and H19
turned off, causing increased growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells
from being destroyed.</span></p>

<p><span>Loss
of imprinting of the Igf2 gene has
been identified in cancer known as embryonal tumors, which include an uncommon
variety of kidney cancer called Wilm’s tumor. Loss of imprinting of Igf2 and the tightly linked H19 locus has been associated with
tumorigenesis in a diversity of patients.</span></p>

<p>H19 <span>and Igf2 expression are closely interrelated, equally they are expressed
in the same tissues during fetal development<em>.</em>
This, coupled expression is only lost in cases of loss of imprinting. </span></p>

<span>The increased activity of the Igf2 gene has been associated with
many types of cancer. In Wilms' tumor, imprinted expression of Igf2 is commonly relaxed, resulting in
maternal allele expression. This is associated with increased methylation and
reduced expression from the maternal copy of the linked H19 locus.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is a drug known as DNA demethylating agents. It belongs to
the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites which are similar to normal
substances within the cell. The cells contain these substances and interact
with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that
causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells. </p>

<p>DNA
methylation is a major mechanism that modulates gene expression in cells and an
increase in DNA methylation can result in the stoppage of the bodily function
of suppressor genes that govern cell division and growth, where unregulated
cell division allows or promotes cancer. </p>

<span>Considering the anti-tumor effect, Decitabine is the DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor, which works as a modifier of
epigenetic profile. This modification process is followed by the interfering
with the methylation of DNA to restore normal function of the tumor suppressor
genes, thus restoring control over cell growth.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The practice of DNA methylation is
heritable, both through mitosis and from one generation to the following. The methylation
program for development is reset in germ line cells, prior to, during or after
meiosis. On that point is some information about the specific controls of DNA
methylation in the germ line, and during early embryogenesis, and genomic
imprinting is certainly associated with differences in DNA methylation in male
and female gametes, and is a reversible change. On that full stop are also
defects in genomic imprinting which produce characteristic phenotypes.</p><p>The definition of a sensitive period is embryogenesis.</p><p>Commonly-used pharmaceutical drugs interfere directly with the
normal controls of DNA and/or histone methylation, which can cause persistent epigenetic
changes, resulting in aberrant gene expression. Thus, these epigenetic drugs
may alter epigenetic homeostasis, and, consequently, any epigenetic side
effects caused by a drug may remain after the drug is stopped. </p>

<span>The Igf2 gene promotes the growth
and division of cells in tissues, and it is highly active during
fetal growth, although it is a lot less active in the adult body. Thus, during
 sensitive period, DNA methylation effects might be extremely
teratogenic, and caring for patients with epigenetic drugs, would be
inadvisable. </span></div>
