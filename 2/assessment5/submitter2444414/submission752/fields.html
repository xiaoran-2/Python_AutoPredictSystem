    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell the CpG islands will be unmethylated and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements will be methylated. This allows expression of the tumor suppressor genes and prevents the repetitive elements from moving around the genome or recombining.  In a cancer cell the CpG islands are likely to be methylated. This suppresses the expression of tumor suppressor genes and allows out of control growth. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated and this allows them to be in a more open chromatin structure so they are able to transpose and recombine around the genome potentially disrupting normal gene expression and contributing to genomic instability. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell the paternal allele is methylated at the imprint control region (ICR) and at the promoter of the H19 gene, this allows the enhancers to promote expression of the lgf2 gene.  The maternal allele on the other hand is unmethylated at the ICR so it can be bound by the insulator CTCF which allows the enhancers act to promote expression of H19 but leaves Igf2 silent. In a normal cell the paternal allele expresses Igf2 and the maternal allele expresses H19, however if both alleles are methylated then both will produce Igf2 and neither will produce H19. Since Igf2 is a growth promoter this double dose of Igf2 results in Wilm's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  Cancer cells typically have hypermethylated CpG islands this prevents the expression of tumor suppressor genes (and some other genes related to regulating cell growth). If a demethylating agent is given it would remove this excess methylation at the CpG islands and allow proper expression of the tumor suppressor genes. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors like Decitabine are nucleoside analogues which are incorporated into the DNA during replication and bind to DNA methyltransferase irreversibly. This decreases the methylation over time as the cell divides.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable therefore if the methylation levels are altered this altered state will be passed on to future daughter cells.  A sensitive period is a time when the epigenetic marks are being cleared or laid down, known as epigenetic reprogramming, such as during development of the germ cells, when imprinting takes place, and the early embryonic development. Treating patient with drugs which alter the epigenetic machinery during these sensitive developmental periods would likely have unintended detrimental effects as aberrant methylation patterns in imprinting and in early embryonic development produce very severe syndromes.</div>
