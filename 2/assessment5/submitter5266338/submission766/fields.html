    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islans (CGIs) have found to be unmethylated on the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes so that they are expressed and suppress the tumor growth. On the other hand, in cancer cells, CGIs are hypermethylated so that associated tumor suppressor genes are silenced and not expressed. By this way, these genes can no longer be able to suppress cancer. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, new cancer cells can have the same DNA methylation pattern easily. This situation helps cancer cells to spread for example in metastasis. <br />In normal cells, repetitive elements and intergenic regions have found methylated. Since repetitive elements form heterochromatin, they help genome stability. In cancer cells, hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions seen genome-wide. This genome-wide hypomethylation causes loss of heterochromatin form and open up the chromosome so allow deletion, insertion and/or reciprocal translocation of chromoses. In other words, genome-wide hypomethylation contributes cancer as it causes genomic instability. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 cluster controlled by methylation of Imprint control center (ICR). In the paternal allele, methylation of ICR blocks CTCF binding to ICR. Without CTCF binding, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter which by this way silenced. Silenced H19 allows Enhancer access to Igf2 to activate it. Therefore, Igf2 is expressed in paternal allele. On the other hand, in maternal allele, CTCF can bind to unmethylated ICR and make H19 promoter active. Active H19 promoter blocks the Enhancer to access Igf2 so that Igf2 is repressed. In other words, Igf2 is not expressed in maternal allele. <br />In Wilm's tumour, loss of methylation at ICR causes <span>biallelic expression of Igf2 i.e. Igf2 is expressed in both paternal and maternal alleles. <br /><br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors. Decitabine inhibits DNMT to methylate genomic locations, so that DNA methylation (as a general) reduces/ no longer occurs. Since effect of DNA methylation is context-dependent, inhibition of DNMT which act globally (and reduction of DNA methylation) may not always stops the growth of cancer i.e. anti-tumor effect. For example, if the tumor or the phase of tumor is caused by "Tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation", Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect. Whereas if the tumor or the phase of tumor is caused by "chromosomal instability" which resulted from genome-wide hypomethylation, Decitabine can not have an anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Therefore, any DNA methylation changes in epigenome can be passed on to daughter cells during cell division. By this way, the effect of drugs can <span>last beyond the period of drug treatment. However, one should be careful about sensitive periods which can be defined as the periods </span><span>when epigenome is more susceptible to changes. This periods are primordial germ cell (PGC) development and early embryonic development. T</span>reating patients during these periods especially the young patients when they develop PGCs would be inadvisable since they can transfer the long term effect of epigenetic treatment in to the next generations (i.e. their childs). Later, they may cause severe diseases in patients' childs. <span><br /></span></div>
