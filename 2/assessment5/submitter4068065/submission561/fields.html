    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Usually in the normal tissue the CpG islands are kept free of methylation independently by the state of the gene downstream to the islands. In cancer tissue the CpG islands tend instead to be methylated causing the silence of the underling gene. For example different tumor suppressor genes as RB in retinoblastoma, MHL1 in colorectal cancer, BRAC1 in breast cancer, MGMT in gliomas can be silenced trough the hypermethylation. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable this is an effective way to silence the tumor suppressor genes. <br />Differently from the CpG island, usually in the normal tissue intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. This insure the genomic stability namely forbid for example illegitimate recombination between the repeats, their transposition. In the cancer tissue the repeats or the intergenic intervals tend to be hypomethylated and this brings inevitably to some genetic instability making more frequently deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations of genes. It has been observed that mutations in Dnmt3B or Dnmt1 (enzymes involved in the DNA methylation) bring to genomic instability and to syndrome that are associated to it.       , <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Sometimes cancer cells show a loss of imprinting with an expression (or silence) from both the alleles. An example of the loss of imprinting trough an alterations in DNA methylation in an ICR is given by the H19/igf2 cluster. In the paternall allele the methylation of the ICR forbid the binding with the trascription factor CTCF, enanchers act on Igf2 that is expressed (while H19 is silenced).   Instead in the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and the CTCF protein binding to it. The neanchers can act on H19 that is expressed while Igf2 remain silenced. Wilm's tumor is caused by a loss of imprinting. The situation is different from the normal one described before due to the methylation of the ICR not only on the paternal but also on the maternal allele. In this case the maternal allele the enanchers act as in the paternal allele allowing the expression of the Igf2. The double expression of Igf2, a gene that is related to the growth, is the reason of this type of tumore.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Decitabine is a Dnmt inhibitors (Dnmti) and act being incorporated to DNA upon replication. When Dnmt come close to the nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand is bound and is not release. The anti-tumor effects is due to the fact that the expression of the tumor suppressor gene is restored since the hypermethylation is getting down and a normal methylation patter is restored.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The change in the DNA methylation affects permanently the epigenome since the methylation is trasmitted to the daughter celles (trough the action of Dnmt1) until they are erased or the Dnmt1 is inibhits. In the sensitive periods where the epigenetic marks are (re-)established, it can be dangerous to threat patients with drugs that altered the epigenome setting since we do not exactly what can be their effects on the entire epigenomic machinery. Thus the potential side effects could be more severe respect to a maintenaince period.     <br /></div>
