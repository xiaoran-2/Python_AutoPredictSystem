    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Methylation of CpG islands serves to control gene
expression. CpG islands often occur at the promoters of genes, particularly
those involved in growth regulation. Unmethylated CpG islands are readily
available for transcription; methylation results in gene silencing, most
commonly  through subsequent binding with
proteins to form a repressive chromatin structure. Most CpG islands in the
normal cell are unmethylated or hypomethylated.</span></p>

<p><span>In contrast, DNA methylation is usually heavy in intergenic
regions and repetitive elements, particularly during the sensitive periods of
epigenetic reprogramming. This serves to help maintain genomic stability, with
their relative transcriptional inaccessibility reducing the likelihood of deletions,
insertions and reciprocal translations or illegitimate recombinations  interfering with normal gene expression and
function.  </span></p>

<p><span>In cancer there is generally a genome-wide progressive
hypomethylation of DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Once
these elements become accessible with the breakdown of normal hypermethylation
the result is genomic instability. Deletions, insertions  and illegitimate recombinations serve to
disrupt normal gene expression and may lead to further transcriptional
aberrations and activation or suppression of neighbouring genes and eventually
to complete genomic instability which is a hallmark of cancer.</span></p>

<p><span>Concomitant with the general DNA hypomethylation seen in
cancer there is usually progressive hypermethylation of some CpG islands at 
tumour-specific  <span>loci, eg RB in
retinoblastoma and BRCA1 in breast cancer, particularly those found in and around
the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, resulting in the silencing of these
genes and allowing uncontrolled expression of potential oncogenes that they
normally suppress.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The combination of genomic instability and increased expression of potential oncogenes results in disruption of normal regulation of cell growth and proliferation and may lead to cancer.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Imprinting is mono-allelic parent-of-origin specific gene
expression, usually  mediated by
differential DNA methylation of the imprint control regions (ICRs) of parental
alleles. </span></p>

<p>The H19/IGF2 gene cluster on the short arm of chromosome 11
is maternally imprinted. Lying between the upstream IGF2, a growth factor, and the
downstream H19 gene, a growth regulator, and their shared downstream enhancers,
the ICR is unmethylated on the normal maternal allele. This allows H19 to be
activated and CTCF protein to bind to the ICR, creating an insulator that
blocks IGF2 enhancer access. Methylation at the ICR on the normal paternal
allele spreads to the adjacent H19 promoter, results in no CTCF binding to the
ICR, and allows IGF2 enhancer access. </p>

<p><span>In Wilms’ tumour the hypermethylation of the ICR extends to
and silences the H19 promoter, no CTCF is produced and the IGF2 gene is
expressed from both alleles, ie there is gene overdosage, which leads to excessive
growth stimulation and eventually to a tumour. Such loss of imprinting,
particularly in genes that regulate cell growth, with resultant gene overdosage,
leading to excessive growth and cell proliferation is a common feature of
cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It
is incorporated into DNA as a nucleoside analogue during replication, and is
thus replication-dependent for its action. Once incorporated it binds
irreversibly with DNMT, inhibiting its activity and preventing or reducing the
DNA hypermethylation seen in most cancers at CpG islands in and around
promoters of genes that regulate cell activity and proliferation.</p>

<p>Cancer cells, which replicate more rapidly than normal
cells, are likely to be differentially affected, with a concomitant reduction
in damage to normal cells.</p>

<p><span>It has proved particularly promising against the
fast-replicating cells seen in some haemopoietic malignancies such as
myeloblastic syndrome, where heavy  <span>CpG
island hypermethylation is strongly associated with silenced regulatory genes.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark that is mitotically heritable, and any alteration will be passed on until actively erased. Drugs that alter DNA methylation may therefore be expected to have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because the altered mark will be passed on to the daughter cells of affected cells and subsequent generations. </p><p>Because of the critical role of epigenetic control in all other tissues and in imprinting, altering DNA methylation can have long-term consequences for both the individual being treated and potentially for future offspring. Unless it is essential to save the patient's life, such treatment may be best avoided during certain sensitive periods.</p><p>These sensitive periods are those when epigenetic reprogramming is occurring, particularly during the formation of primordial germ cells - in the mid-gestation embryo - and during the resetting of epigenetic markers in the early pre-implantation embryo. At this time the DNA methylation is temporarily altered to allow this reprogramming to occur. Treatment with drugs that further alter methylation may further disrupt this process and lead to embryo death and a higher rate of abnormalities,with the potential for any changes to be passed on to future generations.</p><p><br /></p></div>
