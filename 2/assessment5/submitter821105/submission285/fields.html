    <h1>Submission 285 from Anon (session_user_id: 06871ed7996de115278377bcbd3ea7138303cb9f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug, which chemistry is an inhibitor of methyltransferase; this property is well used to regulate the enzyme that methylates DNA (DNMTi). Normally, the enzyme is in charge to methylate DNA for certain epigenetic functions. When this enzyme overmethylates due to any mutation or something else, it becomes overactive and silences more genes than it should.The silencing of inappropriate genes may result in cancer, because some of this silenced genes are antitumoral or form part of the programmed death cell or is time to disassemble it.<br /><br />Hence Decitabile, regulates the DNA methylation back to normality through declining amount of overmethylation, particularly useful to activate again suppressor genes, and in consequence, reducing tumour cells, in particular of the myelogenous leukaemia. <br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Normally, CpG islands are found in about 60% of promoters and have a high CpG density and free of methylation but the genome in general is methylated in their repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and indeed even in the introns of genes, however, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated and the rest of the genome in general, including the repetitive elements in these intergenic elements, and indeed, the introns, are hypomethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene, usually the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. And since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, this means that this contribute to the whole mechanism for a cancer to ocurre (also is needed to activate an oncogene at the same time among others). Permanent stress (such as chronic inflammation, UV exposure, reactive oxygen species) might induce a stable epigenetic switch via mutation in epigenetic enzymes, mistargeting of epigenetic complexes or altered nuclear architecture linked to stress specific gene expression patterns. The altered nuclear morphology of cancer cells is associated with re-arranged active and inactive territories and chromatin, global DNA demethylation and local DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands, which results in silencing of underlying genes.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In other circumstances DNA methylation is synonymous with silencing; this is not the case for imprint control regions (ICR), because imprint control regions have different mechanisms of action. Then, methylation at an imprint control region does not mean that the surrounding genes will be silenced.<br /><br />The H19/Igf2 cluster is controlled by enhance blocking. So we have an imprinted control region unmethylated on the maternal allele, and methylated on the paternal allele.Then, here we know that there is a lncRNA that's being produced and <span>this is called H19. It's produced from the <b></b></span>maternal allele, but has nothing to do with the establishment of imprinting at this particular cluster. <br /><br />When this ICR is unmethylated as a maternal allele, It is bound by a protein CTCF, which is an insulator protein from downstream. If it insulates IGF2, is free to act on H19. But when ICR is methlyated, CTCF can now no longer bind, and there is no insulator action letting Igf2 free to act. This promotes Igf2's expression from the paternal allele, and not the maternal allele. In this case, this methylation is indeed synonymous with gene silencing. These two clusters, can be disrupted in a disorder known as Wilm's tumor.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The combination of histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine (chemotrapeutic drug) is supposed to have long lasting effects due to the modified epigenetic state that is passed from tumoural cells to daughter and granddaughter cells by a "repaired" epigenetic machinery, which inherited mitotically changes as a gene expression. We now know that any epigenetic abnormality is reversible but any cancer treatment that implies an enzyme demethylation shall consider that mitotic heritability is signed by sensitive periods, when epigenetic marks are removed and reprogrammed, mainly during developing of germ cells and in early development. As is already known, all the inhibitor is nucleoside analog and when is incorporated into the DNA upon replication, the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, the DNMT1 binds that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand; that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. The action of these DNA methyltransferase inhibitors hits all replicating cell. The rate of replication of tumoural cells is rather bigger than normal cells so the periods to have the treating dose is crucial to avoid as possible the colateral effects of the inhibitor on normal cells.</div><div><br /><br /></div></div>
