    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Imprinting control region &amp; H19
promotor region are methylated in paternal allele which prevent the binding of CTCF
instulator protein  at Impriting Control
Region (ICR). Methylated ICR region allows the expression of downstream Igf2
gene from paternal allele.</li></ul><ul><li> Imprinting
Control region (ICR) &amp; H19 promotor region are not methylated in
maternal allele. They allow CTCF bind at ICR. Igf2 is not expressed from
maternal allele because of enhancer repression of Igf2.

</li></ul><ul><li>Upregulation of
Igf2 due to abnormal Imprinting Paternal (Maternal) allele was observed in
Wilm’s Tumor (Kidney).</li></ul><ul><li>Methylation at
Maternal ICR &amp; H19 Promotor leads to over expression of Igf2
from both parental alleles. High level Igf2 is responsible in uncontrolled
growth leads to Neoplasm.</li></ul><p> </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li> Decitabine drug
is a DNA Methyl Transfer Inhibitor (DMTi).It is a Nucleotide Analogue where its
action is replication dependent.</li></ul><ul><li> Decitabine demethylate
the cancer specific CpG islands epigenetic markers.</li></ul><ul><li> Decitabine action
on CpG island restore the function of various Tumor Suppressor Genes(TSG) which
regulate the cell division.</li></ul><p> </p><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li> Hypermethylation at CpG island &amp; Hypomethylation at intergenic regions are
the altered epigenetic marks in various cancers.</li></ul><ul><li> Sensitive stage is
the time when cell differentiation and reprogramming of epigenetic marks or
imprinting resetting takes place.</li></ul><ul><li> Primordial germ
cell reprogramming &amp; gemetogenesis during puberty is the sensitive stage of
development.

</li></ul><ul><li>Epigenetic
changes are transgenerational therefore treating patient during sensitive
period leads in interruption in normal imprinting &amp; epigenetic marks which
are essential for normal functions of the cell.       <br /></li></ul></div>
