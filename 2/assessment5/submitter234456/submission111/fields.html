    <div class="field-value"><p>1-1  Describe the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.</p><p><b> CpG islands are regions that are normally devoid of methylation and have a higher G+C content than the genome average.</b><br /></p><p>1-2  Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.</p><p><b>In cancer cells, the CpG islands/di-nucleotides are targeted and then hyper-methylated...thereby preventing any transcription activators to access the DNA.</b><br /></p><p>1-3  Explain how disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer</p><p><b>This basically silences the gene, and often occurs within the tumor suppressor genes. Tumor-suppressor genes have an open chromatin conformation, with promoter CpG island hypomethylation. CpG island hypermethylation closes the chromatin conformation through condensation and packaging, thereby allowing the cell entry in the cycle without regulation, and avoidance of cell death. Interestingly, in tumor cells, the gene-specific 5′ region CpG’s are highly methylated, while the rest of the genome becomes highly un-methylated .This may be due to repetitive sequences and genome stability, as well as tumors cells exhibiting genome fragility and chromatin instability.</b><br /></p><p>1-4  Describe the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements</p><p><b>The normal function of DNA Methylation is to act as a "mark" for the transcription down regulation which then keeps the transcription from occurring when there is no need for it to happen.</b></p><p><br /></p><p>1-5  Describe how DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.</p><p><b>In my family, we have colorectal and prostrate cancer cell lines and these are associated with methylation in the area of the CpG islands but this can extend to a couple thousand kilo-bases from those CpG islands,also.  </b></p><p><br /></p><p>1-6  Explain how disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to cancer.</p><p><em><strong>Hyper methylation can contribute to cancer by silencing tumor suppressor genes.</strong></em></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:

    <div class="field-value">3-1  Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to:<br /><br /><strong><em>Decitabine is a chemo drug in the category of "antimetabolites" that basically kill fast dividing cells like cancer.</em></strong><br /><br />3-2  Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.<br /><br /><strong><em>It works by demethylation or via an interference with the methylation of the DNA and restores the normal function to the turmour suppressor genes and thereby creating proper cellular growth.   </em></strong><br /><br />3-3  Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect:<br /><strong><em><br />The tumour suppressor gene fuctionality is restored along with the usual, normal cellular growth.</em></strong></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
