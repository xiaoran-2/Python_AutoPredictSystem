    <h1>Submission 503 from Anon (session_user_id: 7351e4970c34b1055dc53c8e9dee332271264ed7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, an DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that is reduces DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase from performing methylation.  If the type of tumour has tumour suppressor genes silenced by hypermethylation using a demthylating agent can reactivate the tumour suppressors helping to fight the tumour.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands tend to be associated with gene promoter regions.  DNA methylation of a CpG island regulates the gene expression of the gene being promoted.  In cancer CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated.  The hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer leads to the silencing of tumour suppressor genes.   If a cell has its tumor suppressor genes silenced it loses the tumor suppressing function.  DNA methylation in intergenic and repetitive elements stabilizes the genome by preventing inappropriate recombination.  In cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylation, this leads to genomic instability.  The genomic instability can lead to disruption in coding regions are can activate gene promotion.   DNA hypomethylation can also occur in CpG poor gene promoters leading to increased expression.  If genomic instability disrupts a coding region in a tumpor suprressor it can loose suppressor function.  If genomic instability activates an oncogene promoter or hypomethylation of a CpG poor oncogene promoter can cause over expression of an ocogene which can lead to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal functioning cell ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated this allows the CTCF to insulate the Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers which silences maternal Igf2 expression and H19 is expressed instead.  The paternal allele is methalated preventing CTCF from binding so Igf2 is no insulated from the enhancers which allows expression of the paternal Igf2 gene rather than H19.  In Wilm's tumours the maternal allele becomes methylated like the paternal allele, which leads to expression of the maternal Igf2 gene.  Since the cell now gets a double dose of Igf2 and this gene is a growth promoter this leads to excessive cell growth and cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because DNA methylation is inhertied during cell division it can have a lasting affect on cancer cells, however dna methylation can also have lasting effects on the epignome and passed onto further generations if germ cells are effected.  A sensitive period of development is a period of epigentic reprogramming, when epigentic marks are cleared a reset.  Sensitive periods include pre-implant development and primordial germ cell development.  It would be unwise to use a demethyalting agent during pregnancy because it would interfer with correctly resetting the epigentic marks of the primordial germ cells in an embryo.<br /></div>
