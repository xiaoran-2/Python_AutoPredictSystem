    <div class="field-value">The CpG islands (CGIs) can be found in about 60% of promoter sequences and the methylation of these CGIs influences the gene expression. The CGIs are in active state when they are non-methylated allowing gene expression. In cancers there CGIs get hypermethylated causing the underlying gene silent. When the hypermethylation of CGI occurred in promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes, the genes will silent and therefore promote tumourgenesis. The methylation of  intergenic regions and repetitive elements lead the stability of genome. Normally the intergenic sequences and repetitive sequences are hypermethylated which increases the stability of the genome. In cancers these sequences are get hypomethylated. This hypomethylation increases the movement of transposable elements throughout the genome  and allowing more illegitimate recombination events between homologous regions decreasing the stability of the genome. This reciprocal translocations and recombination can lead insertions, deletions, and generate some point mutations in genes leading activation of genes or sometimes for overexpression of some already expressed genes. These activated genes could be oncogenes which could cause tumourgenesis. These translocations and recombination can also lead to activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes which also allows activation of oncogens.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, the imprinting control region (IPRs) of paternal allele methylated. The methylated IPRs cannot be bound by CTCF insulator. Therefore, the enhancers can bind with <i>Igf2</i> gene leading the expression of growth factor. In a normal maternal cell the IPRs is bound by CTCF insulator and therefore the enhances go and bind with promoter reion of <i>H19</i> gene allowing the expression of <i>H19</i> gene. The <i>Igf2</i> gene does not expressed in the maternal allele in a normal cell as the IPRs is sequestered by the CTCF insulator preventing binding of enhancer to the <i>Igf2</i> gene. In the Wilm's tumour, the IPRs in the maternal allele is also get methylated promoting the enhancers go and bind to the <i>Igf2</i> gene but not the <i></i><i>H19</i> gene which leading the expression of the <i>Igf2 </i>gene.  Therefore, not only the <i>Igf2</i> gene in the paternal allele but the <i>Igf2</i> gene maternal allele also get expressed making a double dose of <i>Igf2</i> growth factor making rapid cell proliferation. There can be many alterations in the genome during this rapid proliferation activating oncogenes, over expression of growth factors, and silencing tumour suppressor genes promoting tumorgenesis and finally cancers.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent which belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) which leads to hypomethylation of DNA by inhibiting DNA methylation. The drug can be used to treat further hypermethyltion of CpG islands (CGIs) which could in tern remove the suppression of expression of tumour suppressor genes. Therefore, the expression and activity of tumour suppressor genes will not be affected by hypermethylation of CGIs in promoter regions and the epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor genes can be reactivated which in turn suppress the activation of oncogenes and inactivate the over expressed genes. The Decitabine can be used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes such as DNA mathylation can be passed during cell division to daughter cells even their granddaughter cells. These changes can be passed until the changes got actively erased and once erased these changes cannot reestablished. Therefore, if some DNA methylation changes made using an enzyme, the genome will show enduring effects as the DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve these marks during mitosis. These epigenetic change like DNA methylation can influence the normal functionality of the patient durng sensitive periods where the  epigenetic reprogramming occurs extensively such as during pregnancy. There are many epigenetic reprogramming occurs during early child development and primodial germ cell development. Treatments which change the epigenetic state of patients during sensitive periods can leads long-term complicated situations such as inefficient brain development, infertility, and many other different syndromes. Therefore, it is inadvisable to treat patients during sentitive periods.</div>
