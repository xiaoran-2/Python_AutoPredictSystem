    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands involves methylation of cytosine by methyltransferases at locations on the genome that are defined by chains of CG (Cytosine-Guanine) repeats.  In cancer CpG islands are typically converted from hypomethylated to hypermethylated states.  The hypermethylated condition silences the transcription of neighboring genes under the island's control. Those genes silenced may be tumor suppressors.  Loss of tumor suppression results in a cancerous tumor. </p><p> Intergenic regions and repeats are typically methylated in normal cells, but become hypomethylated in cancerous cells.  Hypomethylation can lead to genomic instability: increases/decrease in chromosome number, insertions, deletions, improper recombinations.  Hypomethylation at CpG poor promoters can also lead to activation of cancer promoting (growth fostering) genes or of genes that produce miRNAs that target  (deactivate) tumor suppressor genes.  The latter results in a reduction of tumor suppressor activity and consequent cancerous tumor formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the case of the Igf2/H19 cluster, the imprint control region (ICR) is unmethylated on the maternal chromosome but methylated on the paternal chromosome.  The normal behavior of the maternal allele is the expression of H19, a long noncoding (lnc) RNA, which acts to activate downstream enhancers.  The enhancers can act on either the H19 gene or the Igf2 gene depending on the binding of an insulator protein, CTCF, to the ICR.  CTCF only binds to the unmethylated, maternal ICR.  In that case the enhancers are insulated (blocked) from acting on Igf2 and act on H19 to increase H19 expression.  On the methylated paternal ICR, CTCF is prevented from binding and there is no associated insulator effect and the enhancers act on Igf2 to enhance its expression.  Also, because of chromatin spreading, methylation spreads downstream to silence the H19 gene. H19 and a second, linked gene, Cdkn1c, are tumor suppressor genes and Igf2 is an oncogene.  If through a chromosomal replication error, e.g. deletion, imprinting on the maternal gene is disrupted so that it behaves more like a paternal gene, Igf2 expression will be increased and H19 and/or Cdkn1c decreased.  Wilm's tumor and/or other cancers may result.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA-demethylating agents or DNMT inhibitors.  Since hypermethylation of CpG islands can result in silencing of neighboring cancer suppression genes, if the islands can be reverted back to their normal, hypomethylated state by demethylation, those silenced suppressor genes will be reactivated.  Decitabine, because it is nucleoside analog, acts by being incorporated into the DNA during replication.  DNMTs then become irreversibly bound to the Decitabine moiety with consequent reduction in methylating activity.  Since cancer cells divide more frequently than normal cells, they are preferentially affected.   Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes to DNA are retained during mitosis in cell replacement and/or tissue growth.  If one can develop drugs that favorably affect errant DNA methylation that is a cause of cancer, then those epigenetic modifications should be retained for the life of the organism and thus constitute a permanent cure.  A sensitive period is one in which epigenetic marks or imprinting is being modified in the organism.   These periods are during the erasure of parental imprinting (methylation) in the preimplantation blastocyst shortly after fertilization and where parental imprinting is being applied (methylated) in the mid gestation stage of fetal development.  Treating patients with epigenetic modifiers during these periods is inadvisable because the epigenetic marks may be in a partially developed, unstable state of transition between erasure or formation.  Thus, the drug would have a variable, poorly defined substrate to act upon and an unpredictable product might result.</div>
