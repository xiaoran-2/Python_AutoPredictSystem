    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is brought about by a group of enzymes known as the DNA methyltransferases (DNMT). The DNMTs known to date
                     are DNMT1, DNMT1b, DNMT1o, DNMT1p, DNMT2, DNMT3A, DNMT3b with its isoforms, and DNMT3L. Methylation can be de novo (when CpG dinucleotides on both DNA strands 
are unmethylated) or maintenance (when CpG dinucleotides
                     on one strand are methylated). DNMT1 has de novo as
 well as maintenance methyltransferase activity, and DNMT3A and DNMT3b
                     are powerful de novo methyltransferases.The importance of these enzymes has been shown using several mouse experiments in which the mouse deficient in the gene dies
                     early in development or immediately after birth.<br /><p>The regulation of eukaryotic gene expression is a complex 
process. Transcription initiation is a highly controlled and integrated
                     event that involves <i>cis</i>-acting and <i>trans</i>-acting factors. The <i>cis</i>-acting elements are DNA sequences that act as the substrate for the <i>trans</i>-acting
 factors, and the DNA in the vicinity is prepared for transcription. 
Increased methylation in the promoter region of
                     a gene leads to reduced expression, whereas 
methylation in the transcribed region has a variable effect on gene 
expression.</p>
                  
                  Several mechanisms have been proposed to 
account for transcriptional repression by DNA methylation. The first 
mechanism involves
                     direct interference with the binding of specific 
transcription factors to their recognition sites in their respective 
promoters.
                     Several transcription factors, including AP-2, 
c-Myc/Myn, the cyclic AMP-dependent activator CREB, E2F, and NFkB, 
recognize
                     sequences that contain CpG residues, and binding of
 each has been shown to be inhibited by methylation.<br /><br />DNA methylation can also affect histone modifications and chromatin 
structure, which, in turn, can alter gene expression.
                     The underlying patterns of methylated cytosines are
 important in guiding histone deacetylation to certain residues.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>
            Decitabine is a DNA "demethylating"
            agent. When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in
            the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and
            growth.  When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated,
            allowing or promoting cancer. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold. One way
            that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA. 
            By this process, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes
            is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites. 
            Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When
            the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact
            with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that
            causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells. <br /></p><p>*Drug information by ChemoCare.<br /></p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>

        epigenome.
