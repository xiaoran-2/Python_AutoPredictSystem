    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer in several ways.  </p><p>In <u>CpG Islands</u>: </p><p></p><ul><li>In the <u>normal </u>situation methylation at CpG
islands leads to <u>silencing of the gene</u>. In the normal situation tumour
suppressor genes are unmethylated and they are active.</li><li>In <u>cancer</u> CpG islands of tumour suppressor
genes are <u>hypermethylated,</u> silenced.</li><li>DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to <u>silencing
of the tumour suppressor gene</u>. DNA methylation is <u>mitotically heritable</u>
and epimutations are <u>rapidly selected</u>. So the <u>number of cells</u> with
silenced tumour suppressor genes at the cancer focus rapidly i<u>ncreases</u>.</li></ul><p><span>In <u>intergenic regions</u> and <u>repetitive
elements</u>:   </span></p><p></p><ul><li>In the <u>normal situation</u> repetitive elements and
intergenic regions are <u>methylated</u> leading to <u>genomic stability.</u></li><li>In <u>cancer </u>cells intergenic regions and
repetitive elements are <u>hypomethylated</u> which leads to <u>genomic
instability</u>.</li><li>Hypomethylation of repeats/intergenic intervals leads
to <u>genomic instability</u>: Illegitimate recombination between repeats, Activation of repeats and transposition, Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to
neighbouring genes can occur.</li></ul>DNA methyletion leads to genomic instability and silencing of tumour suppressor genes.DNa methylation is mitotically heritable and epimutations are rapidly selected so the number of cells with altered DNA methylation profile at cancer site rapidly increases. DNA methylation can be one of the hits in the Knudsen hypothesis and increase the chance of the occurrance of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation of ICR’s, loss of imprinting, can
contribute to cancer. For example Wilm's tumour:</p>

<p>Normal situation:</p><p></p><ul><li>In the normal situation <u>methylation</u> at the ICR
of the <u>paternal allele</u> prevents CTCF binding.  Without CTCF , DNA methylation spreads to the
H19 promoter,
<u>H</u><u>19</u><u> </u><u>is </u><u>silenced</u> and enhancers access Igf2 to
activate, <u>Igf2 is expressed.</u></li><li>The <u>maternal allele </u>is <u>unmethylated, </u>allowing
the <u>CTCF</u> (an insulator protein) to bind. CTCF <u>insulates Igf2</u> from
downstream enhancers and allow enhancers to access the  H19 promoter. <u>H</u><u>19 i</u><u>s expressed</u>
and <u>Igf2 is not expressed</u></li></ul><p>Wilm’s tumour, loss of imprinting; </p><p></p><ul><li>The ICR at the maternal allele is also methylated, <u>H</u><u>19 </u><u>is silenced </u>and
<u>Igf2 is expressed. L</u>eading in the cell to <u>a double dose of Igf2</u>
and <u>no H</u><u>19 </u><u>at
all</u>.</li><li><u>Igf2 is growth promoting</u>. <u>H</u><u>19</u> expresses a non-coding RNA that functions as a <u>tumour
suppressor</u>,, No expression of H19 in combination with <u>double
expression of Igf2  leads to Wilm’s tumour.</u></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug used in cancer treatment that has
an effect on the epigenome: </p><p></p><ul><li>Decitabine is an enzyme that belongs to the DNA
MethylTransferase (<u>DNMT</u>) <u>inhibitors</u>.</li><li>It <u>demethylates DNA</u> (in low concentrations).
The optimal dose for cancer treatment is rather low, it is a dose where the
anti-neoplastic effect is maximal and the toxic, nonspecific effect is
tolerable. </li><li>DNMT inhibitors
are nucleoside analogues that <u>irreversibly bind DNMTs</u> after they are <u>incorporated
into DNA</u>. DNMT inhibitors, like Decitabine, are <u>replication dependent</u>.
Decitabine <u>affects dividing cells</u>. A characteristic of cancer is that <u>cancer
cells divide more rapidly</u> than normal cells and are <u>more severely affencted</u>
by the drug, because they are replicating more. The mechanism of action of the
drug is still unclear. It might work in haematological malignancies since they
are dependent on <u>tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation of the CpG islands</u>.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that
last beyond the period of drug treatment.</p><p></p><ul><li>DNA methylation produces a <u>stable epigenetic mark, </u>once
it is established it is normally only removed at a period of epigenetic reprogramming
in germ cells, it is maintained in somatic cells. It is <u>mitotically
heritable</u>. Reprogramming occurs during gametogenesis and in ealy development in vivo.</li><li>A <u>sensitive period</u> in epigenetics is a period <u>of
epigenome reprogramming</u>. At that period epigenome can receive new
epigenetic marks that can stay put during the lifespan and be passed on to the <u>progeny</u>.</li><li>Sensitive periods are; <u>early development</u> (right
after fertilization to formation of the epiblast) and <u>Primordial Germ Cell</u>
(PGC)<u> development</u>; oogenesis in females (it is complete either before or
shortly after birth) and spermatogenesis in males ( it starts in puberty and
continues during life) extending to the period of germ cell maturation (9-12 in
♂ and 8-10 in ♀).</li></ul>If you treat patients at the sensitive periods the
epigenome that is changed by the drug <u>stays active</u> for the rest of the <u>lifespan</u>
(leading to undesirable side effects) and can be transmitted to <u>future
generations</u>. Treatment during these periods should be avoided as much as
possible.<br /></div>
