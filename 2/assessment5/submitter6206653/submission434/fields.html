    <div class="field-value">The methylation profile in normal cells is: CpG islands are hypomethylated; intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. In cancer cells profile of CpG methylation is reverse: CpG islands are <strong>hypermethylated</strong>, intergenic regions and repeats are <strong>hypomethylated</strong>. In cancer hypermethylation of CpG islands causes stable transcriptional silencing and for many tumor suppressor genes can serve as alternative mechanism to mutation for tumor suppressor genes inactivation (HC Tsai and SB Baylin, Cell Research 2011,21:502-517). Tumor suppressor gene inactivation can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation, disruption of many cellular function such as cell-cycle regulation, cell motility, cell-cell adhesion et cetera. Overall, it leads to progression of tumor growth, which affects neighboring cells.<br />Heavily methylated repetitive elements and intergenic regions in normal cells play an important role in maintenance of <strong>genomic stability</strong>. For example, hypermethylated tandem repeats at and near centromere keep DNA packed into heterochromatin at the point of sister chromatid association that provide chromosome stability. Hypomethylation in this region leads to decondensation of chromatin and chromosome rearrangement due to unstable translocation which cause <strong>wide genomic instability-hallmark of cancer </strong>(Virani et al, ILAR Journal 2012, 53:359-369). Hypomethylation of repeats/intergenic regions contribute to tumorigenesis by increasing genomic rearrangements such as deletion, insertions and reciprocal translocations in chromosomes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19 and Igf2 are reciprocally imprinted genes of H19/Igf2 cluster. In normal cells <em><strong>H19 expressed from maternal allele</strong></em>, whereas <strong><em>Igf2 from paternal one</em></strong>. Two regulatory domains are important for parental-allele specific expression: imprinting control region (ICR) and tissue-specific enhancers. The last one shares by both allele. In contrary, ICR region is differently methylated, in in paternal allele is <strong>methylated</strong> whereas in maternal allele <strong>is not</strong>. DNA methylation at ICR of paternal allele prevents binding of the insulator protein, CTCF and allows enhancer to access Igf2 gene and inhibit H19 expression by methylation of H19 promoter. In turn, in maternal allele CTCF binds to unmethylated ICR and this interaction allows downstream enhancer to access H19 promoter. <br />Hypermethylation at ICR of maternal allele reverses it to paternal epigenotype and turns Igf2 expression<b> </b><i><b>in</b></i> and H19 expression<b> </b><i><b>off</b></i>. Therefore, cells will have double amount of Igf2 and lack of H19 which displays a tumor suppression function in mice (Yoshimizu at al, PNAS, 2008, 105: 12417-12422). Igf2 is insulin-like growth factor 2 (PubMed:protein database) which is promoting cell growth, double amount of Igf2 will increase cell growth and predispose to tumor development. Loss of Igf2 imprinting is associated with Wilm's tumor. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to class of <strong>DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) inhibitors</strong>. Decitabine is cytosine nucleoside analogue and it is replication-dependent drug. It requires incorporation of the drug into DNA of replicating cells. Incorporated drug binds DNMT and forms covalent intermediates (hence, irreversible binding), which <b>inhibits DNA methylation</b> in next round of DNA replication. This drug in low doses is effective in treatment of haematological malignancies, particullarly in the pre-leukemic disorders-myelodysplastic syndrome occurring in elderly patients. The mechanism of anti-tumor effect of this drug is still unclear. One possible mechanism is that Decitabine decreases DNA methylation to some extent in hypermethylated CpG islands in DNA of  cancerous cells and may cause potential <strong>reexpression</strong> of some tumor suppressor genes which were silenced in association with DNA hypermethylation. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The epigenetic control of gene expression by DNA methylation is very potent way in drugs design strategy for treatment of certain type of tumors. Once alteration in DNA methylation established by drug(s) it can have a long lasting effect, because <strong>epigenetic changes are mitotically inheritable</strong>. In case with DNMTs inhibitors the DNA methyltransferase will keep methylation marks during mitosis and pass "the memory" to a daughter cells. Since there are not yet ways to deliver drugs directly to site of action, the alteration in epigenome caused by drugs may also affect the normal epigenetic control of gene expression. It is especially became important in <strong>sensitive period of epigenetic control regulation</strong>, when extensive epigenetic reprogramming in <strong>embryonic development </strong>and  <strong>germ cells formation</strong> occurs. Therefore, it would be not advisable to use drugs altering epigenetic state for pregnant women or even for women who planning to became pregnant. She might stop to use drug(s) for several month before conception. It would be inadvisable to prescribe these drugs for treatment of cancer in children who are in pubertal period when gametes (both male and female) are forming. </div>
