    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are mostly constitutive regions of the human promoters of the genes. CpG islands tend to stay unmethylated in the promoters of the genes, but however, when some gene needs to be silenced, the CpG islands undergo a methylation process. The DNA methylation of CpG islands in cancer is disrupted probably with genetic alterations of the epigenetic machinery. The disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands can result with activation of the oncogenes.<br />The genome contains a large amount of repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns, which in normal cells are silenced, by methylation. These regions in cancer cells become hypomethylated.The disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability (Illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promotes and disruption to neighbouring genes).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The loss of imprinting or hypermethylation can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or growth promoting genes which either way can cause tumourgenesis . One example such example is a hypermethylation of the maternal H19/Igf2 cluster.<br />On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and the CTCF insulator protein cannot bind to the ICR and then the methylation from the ICR spreads to the H19 promoter, which is also silenced. Then the enhancers can access Igf2 and activate it's expression.On the other hand, on the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and the CTCF protein binds to the ICR and insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. So, the enhancers on the maternal allele activate the expression of H19.<br />In Whilm's tumour there is a hypermethylation of the ICR on the both, paternal and maternal allele, so Igf2 (a growth promoting gene) is overexpressed.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNMTi (DNA Methyl-Transferase inhibitors). Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue and it is incorporated in the DNA. After that, during the cell division, when DNMT copies the methylation to the daughter- strand, the drug binds irreversibly the DNMT, so the DNMT no longer can preform the methylation and therefore it causes DNA demethylation.<br />Tumour cells are rapidly dividing cells and because Decitabine is a division-depended, therefore it is an effective cure, because the tumour cells are dividing more than the other cells and that's why the tumour cells are more easily targeted.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitoticaly heritable, so altering the DNA methylation can have effects on daughter and granddaughter cells, for example erasing the DNA methylation can stop the cell from growning.<br />Sensitive period is represented as a period when the epigenetic reprogramming is preformed. The period of early development (pre-implantation preiod, blastocyst stage) and the period of primordial germ cells development are considered as sensitive periods. During these periods the clearing and putting of epigenetic marks on different cell types is preformed. So treatment with drugs that target the epigenetic machinery which does the epigenetic reprogramming during there periods is unadvisable.</div>
