    <h1>Submission 272 from Anon (session_user_id: 7572df7bb605072d96489f702908b070a0bf2e8c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> DNA methylation is mitotically heritable because the DNMT1 which keeps transferring methylation to the daughter and granddaughter cells. When there is an alteration in DNA methylation because of inhibiting DNMT, the unmethylated DNA will be heritable during the cell division due to the obstruction of DNMT by the drug (Epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable).Therefore, hypomethylated CpG islands will be obtained during many generations of cell division and the alteration of DNA methylation can last beyond the period of drug treatment. Once a change in DNA methylation occurs, a suitable histone modification happens. For example, <span>the demethylation of
the DNA is often allied with active histone acethylation and histone methylation which retain the chromatin opened and
consequently the gene is expressed. </span>The sensitive period is the stage when a clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks happens. However, there are two sensitive periods during developments: the first is the reprogramming during early embryonic development whereas the second is during germ cells developing. We have to avoid treating patients during these periods because we can disrupt the resetting of the epigenetic marks and have many undesirable effects. For example, we don't have to treat very young people during developing their germ cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often
found near the promoters of the genes. In normal cells, these islands are
mostly protected from DNA methylation. However, when DNA methylation occurs at
CpG islands in those cells, it plays a very important role in organizing gene expression.
Moreover, CpG islands are hypomethylated (or unmethylated) in the promoter of
tumor suppressor genes.<span><br /><br />
In contrast, in cancer, it is noticed that CpG
islands in tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated and this allied with inactive histone marks and leading to the silencing of
those genes. As a result, the cell escapes from division regulation, divides more rapidly and becomes a cancer cell.<br /><br />
There is an alteration of DNA methylation
between the normal and the cancer cell. In general, in cancer cells, scientists noticed an
increase in DNA methylation in specific locus of CpG islands against a decrease
in DNA methylation in intergenic and repetitive elements. In normal cells,
there is DNA hypermethylation in intergenic and repetitive
elements to retain a genome stability. The function of this methylation is to
inhibit the repetitive elements to jump between genes and disrupt their
expression besides sustain chromosomes</span> number. The importance of the
methylation in intergenic regions is to organize the start and the end of genes
and inhibit their RNA  cohesion which results in changing their
functions. </p><p><span>
<br />
In cancer, DNA methlaytion in intergenic regions
and repetitive elements is disrupted by hypomethylation. Genome wide decrease
in DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitve elements is noticed in
cancer cell which will lead to genome instability because of illegal
recombination between repeats (insertion, deletion, reciprocal translocation), disrupting the
expression of the other genes such as what happens in Avy and axin alleles.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In Cancer, disruption
of imprinting can happens either by hypermethylation or hypomethylation and in
both cases we will miss the imprinting effect. </p>

<p>On the paternal allele
there is a methylation in the imprint control region (ICR) and that inhibits
the CTCF insulator from binding to it and this allows to Enhancers to promote
the expression of Igf2. In addition, there is a methylation in H19 resulted
from the distribution of ICR methylation. </p><p><span><br />
In contrast, On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated
and this allows binding with CTCF insulator which in its role prohibits the Enhancers
from promoting the Igf2, but activation of H19 instead. Igf2 is active in the
paternal allele but inactive in the maternal allele.</span></p>

<p><span><br />
In Wilm's tumor, </span>the disruption of H19/Igf2 occurs by hypermethylation at the ICR. In other words the imprinting at H19/Igf
cluster is disrupted by the methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele. This methylation prevents CTCF insulator from binding with ICR, but enables the Enhancers to activate Igf2 gene on the maternal allele. Thus, an overexpression
of the oncogene (growth promoting gene) Igf2 and loss of imprinting. This
overexpression of the Igf2 leads to rapid cell division and cancer
characteristics.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA
methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). It has been used effectively
in myelodysplastic syndrome therapy. This drug prohibits the DNA
methyltransferase enzyme (DNMT) from laying down the methyl group on the
cytosine base in CpG dinucleotides. Decitabine is
nucleoside paralogue. This character enables it to incorporate into the DNA
during DNA replication or cell division. Thus, it
binds irreversibly to DNMT which becomes unable to put the methyl group
on the daughter strand of the DNA during its replication. Moreover, Its effect depends on
the frequency of the cell division occurrence which exceed the norm in the
cancer cells. In other words, it inhibits the DNA methylation and helps us to
control cancer cells methylation. As a result, reducing hypermethylation
in CpG islands that are located in tumor suppressor genes and reactivating of
these genes as a consequence. In this way it may be used to treat the cancer.</p>
