    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the process by which enzymes called methyltransferases
help to attach a methyl group to CpG islands; a region in linear DNA where
cytosine and guanine are separated by one single phosphate. DNA methylation in
mammals helps to turn a gene off, or in other words, silence it.</p>

<p>Many a time, the methyltransferases get mutated and start to
methylate the histones (packaging unit of DNA) excessively. This increased
amount of methylation causes too of much silencing of the genes, which may also
silence the tumor-suppressing genes, which are needed for managing the
uncontrolled proliferation of tumor-causing cells. This chain reaction leads to
cancer. </p><p>DNA methylation occurs intergenic regions and repetitive elements such as LINEs, SINEs, and satellite repeats as well. This may lead to repression of transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibition of antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and may relate to replication timing (Biochimie, 1994).</p><p>In cancer, DNA methylation at intergenic sites and repetitive elements is disrupted as excessive cell proliferaton demands increase in methyltransferase production which leads to increased DNA-methylation. This causes excessive silencing of genes which silence tumor suppressor genes and so, the process of exponential proliferation of cells continues and grows.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a kind of DNA-methylating agent, used to treat
myelodysplastic syndromes which are the precursors to acute myelogenous
leukemia. </p><p>The drug acts on the DNA by reducing the amount of methylation occurring in the cell, thus lowering the amount of genes being silenced. </p>

<p>This drug can act in combination with deacetylases inhibitors
in the treatment of cancer. They act by slowing the growth of solid tumors, by
penetrating through the tumor. By decreasing the amount of DNA-methylation in the cell, silencing of tumor-suppressor genes also gets reduced. As tumor suppressors are synthesized, they help to control the rapid proliferation of cancer cells. Epigenetic changes are inherited by daughter
cells and continue to be inherited through generations of cells until they are
actively erased. This system helps the Decitabine to effectively eradicate
cancer cells in a solid tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alteration of DNA methylation is an epigenetic approach to the treatment of cancer. Epigenetic changes are known to be passed on to daughter cells and further through several generations of cells. These changes continue to be inherited until the cancer cells no longer proliferate and the tumor is actively erased. Due to this property of epigenetics, effects of altering DNA-methylation last even after the period of drug treatment is over. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
