    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at promoter CpG islands is to bring about silencing of the associated gene but in normal cells CpG islands are generally unmethylated. In cancer CpG islands and shores are hypermethylated leading to gene silencing. This leads to deregulation of various cellular processes allowing cancer cells to proliferate.<br /><br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions depends on what exists in such a region which could have a regulatory function or be an ICR. DNA methylation helps to silence repetitive elements preventing their propagation and disruption of other genes or leading to recombination. DNA methylation in intergenic regions during cancer can lead to changes in expression of genes such as IGF-2 and aberrant methylation of repetitive elements in cancer can switch on genes to promote its survival.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele H19 and the ICR is methylated and CTCF cannot bind so IGF2 can be expressed.  <br />In the maternal allele H19 is expressed, the ICR is not methylated and CTCF can bind so IGF2 expression is silenced. <br /><br />In Wilm’s tumour there is bi-allelic expression of IGF2 due to loss of maternal gene silencing via methylation in the ICR. The over-expression of IGF2 promotes growth which results in cell division and production of a tumour which can then undergo additional changes to become malignant.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, leading to reduced DNA methylation by irrivesibly binding the enzyme to the DNA depleting it inside cells. This works best in tumours because they are rapidly dividing unlike normal cells. This would reduce the methylation ability of cancer cells to methylate genes which control proliferation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because these changes are inhereted by daughter cells upon division and might not be cleared out in the formation of gametes<br /><br />A sensitive period is one where the cells need to be re-programmed, undergoing changes to be able to produce different cell types. Sensitive periods include embryogenesis and  gametogenesis, although childhood seems to also be a sensitive period for some on-going processes. Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because it could cause/prevent epigenetic changes which would effect both the individual for life and/or possibly their progeny depending on which sensitive stage is involved. <br /></div>
