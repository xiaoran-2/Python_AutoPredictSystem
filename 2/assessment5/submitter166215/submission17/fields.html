    <h1>Submission 17 from Anon (session_user_id: 3e0db7e0d05d194ff47ba607e05732ecab1c7164)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine works as a demethylase to remove methyl groups from nucleic acids. Cancers are often seen to have methylation on tumor suppressor genes such as p53, and thus cause silencing of the protein. A targeted demethylase such as decitabine could remove the methyl group allowing the tumor suppressors to active appropriately. It is likely that decitabine binds to an inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">When epigenetic marks are removed, they are not restored. Thus, if the histone-deacetylase inhibitor is combined with the azactidine (a demethylase), then the daughter cells of proliferating cancer cells will likely express antioncogenes. Contrary to this, without the drug treatment, cancer cells will maintain epigenetic programming and pass that on to daughter cells.<br /><br />During development certain periods are highly susceptible to epigenetic changes due to environmental factors. These are known as sensitive periods. Early development is a key sensitive period. Treating a patient with the above drugs while pregnant or in young childhood could result in demethylation or acetyl activation of otherwise silenced genes. The result could be an increased disease state instead of treatment since these changes would be passed on to daughter cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Under normal cicumstances, DNA methyl transferase acts with a donor to add a methyl group to a cytosine at CpG islands within a promoter to silence gene expression. In cancer, global demethylation can be observed with areas of hypermethylation termed CIMP (CpG Island Methylator Phenotype). Hypermethylation can be especially observed during tumor progression. A global deregulation of methylation can lead to erroneous expression of oncogenes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br />Methylation of regions between genes can lead to histone modification and silencing. Fig. 1 bottom (Hassler and Egger, 2012) demonstrates trimethylation of H3K9 and H4K20. At these sites lncRNA can bind to methyl groups recruiting PRC2 controlling pluripotency and differentiation. Other less understood non-coding RNAs have been found highly expressed in cancers at ultraconserved regions. Disruption of normal methylation at these regions can result in disregulation of cell cycle, over proliferation of cells, and activation of normally quiescent genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting occurs such that only one allele of a gene is expressed. Paternally express lncRNA AIR binds to methylation on the CpG island of the promoter on maternal Igf2 which results in silencing. The antisense RNA (paternal lncRNA) is transcribed because of methylation on the upstream promoter of H19. <br /><br />Wilm's tumor is a type of kidney cancer that occurs in children. Loss of imprinting at Igf2 on the maternal allele resulting in aberrant cell growth forming a tumor. Similarly, the loss of imprinting at H19/Igf2 can develop tumor-initiating cells. Decreased methylation can result in a loss of chromatin stability and the creation of a cancer stem cell (Leick et. al., 2012). </div>
