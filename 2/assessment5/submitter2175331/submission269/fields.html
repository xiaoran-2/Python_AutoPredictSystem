    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer in two ways:  The DNA of cancerous cells tend to have more than the normal amount of methylation (hypermethylation) at CpG islands and less than the normal amount (hypomethylation) in the remainder of the genome.  </p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence any genes that should not be active in the cell.  In cancerous cells, methylation of the wrong CpG islands may silence tumor suppressor genes, allowing the cell to divide uncontrollably.  </p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to promote genomic stability.  In cancerous cells the methylation may be missing for these elements.  Without this methylation, illegitimate recombination can occur between different sets of repeats, causing chromosome deletions, insertions and translocations.  This may delete or silence tumor suppressor genes or allow the promotion of oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer by doubling the promotion of oncogenes or silencing tumor suppressor genes.  </p>
<p>An example of this can be found in the H19/lgf2 cluster.  In normal cells, the paternal copy of the H19/lgf2 imprint control region (ICR) and part of the H19 gene are methylated.  This silences the paternal copy of the H19 gene and activates the paternal copy of the lgf2 gene. The maternal copy of this cluster is unmethylated, and results in the opposite effect: H19 is active and lgf2 is silenced.  </p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor cells, the imprinting of this cluster is disrupted, and both the paternal and maternal copies of the cluster are methylated.  This contributes to the growth of the tumor because two copies of the growth-promoting lgf2 gene are active.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cancer drug which is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and acts as a DNA-demethylating agent.  Often in cancerous cells, misplaced DNA methylation marks silence tumor suppressor genes.  When used to treat certain types of pre-leukemia, Decitabine causes methylation marks to be lost during cell division. This hypomethylation allows the tumor suppressor genes to be expressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects which last long after the drug treatment because changes to DNA methylation are permanent unless erased.  The changes are mitotically heritable, which means that they will be passed down to all the decendents of a given cell. </p>
<p> Sensitive periods are times in which cells are undergoing epigenetic reprogramming — that is, when epigenetic markers are erased and rewritten on the genome.  The first of the two main sensitive periods occurs very early in pregnancy, before the fertilized egg implants in the womb.  During this period epigenetic marks are erased and written in the blastocyst.  </p>
<p>The second sensitive period begins during mid-gestation and continues through pregnancy.  In this period, epigenetic marks are erased and rewritten on the fetus’ primordial germ cells.  Additionally, this process continues for females during puberty when their oocytes receive their final methylation marks.   <br /></p>
<p>Any treatment that affects DNA methylation could disrupt this reprogramming, so it should be avoided during pregnancy and for girls near puberty.  Because one of the sensitive periods occurs before a woman may know that she is pregnant, it should also be avoided for women who plan to become pregnant or are not using reliable birth control.<br /></p></div>
