    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since CpG islands often at promoters of genes,methylation at CpG island is equal to silencing of gene expression.Simply speaking, cancer is result of activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumour suppressors. But, CGI of tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation and genome-wide(dominantly repeats,CpG poor promoters as well) hypomethylation are commonly found in cancer,and these progress with tumorigenicity.Genomic integrity is maintained by DNA methylation at intergenic region which silence cryptic transcription start(or splice) sites and DNA methylation at repetitive element which prevents transposition,transpositional interference and illegimate recombination.However,in cancer,hypomethylation of repetitive element and intergenic region can both contribute to genomic instability.Hypomethylation of repetitive elements or intergenic regions lead to activation of repetitive elements and transposition,or cryptic promoters,or illegimate recombination between repeats.Since repeats and intergenic regions are widely distributed in genome, genomic instability is the direct result of DNA hypomethylation.We can observe this kind of genomic instability via abnormal karyotype.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/lgf12 cluster demonstrate an imprinting pattern which named enhancer blocking.Insulator protein CTCF insulate lgf2 from dowmstream enhancer,The main difference between maternal and paternal methylation pattern is caused by the existence of CTCF.In maternal allele,CTCF exists and binds at ICR,so H19 is active,and enhancer can only enhance the expression of H19 but not lgf2.In paternal allele,CTCF doesn't exist ,and ICR is methylated, H19 is silenced in this way, enhancer can access lgf2 and activeate its expression.Simply speaking,lgf2 is expressed in paternal allele but not expressed in maternal allele.In Wilm's tumour,hypermethylation of ICR is found,and lgf2 is overexpressed.in both maternal and paternal alleles.But lgf2 is a growth-promoting oncogene,overexpression of lgf2 prgresses with tumorigenicity.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent,so it belongs to DNMT inhibitors. Decitabine is analogous to nucleoside.It can irreversibly binds DNMTs after incorporating into DNA,so inhibits DNA methylation spreading.And it is replication dependent because of DNMT mechanism. Decitabine is used in myelodysplastic syndrome at low dose,although its anti-tumour mechanism is still unclear,we don't know which gene hypomethylated by it.Since it can  work on haematological malignancies,we can suspect it depends on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dr Stephen Baylin used a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine to slow tumour growth in advanced lung cancer.These two drugs both target enzymatic epigenetic regulators,and can irreversibly alter the methylation and acetylation level after agents are used.Via the result of hypomethylation and acetylation, epigenome gets a higher level of expressive marks,so a more open chromatin in a lasting way. Because epigenetic alterations only happen in cell division(another way saying replication dependent),so once the hypomethylation and acetylation are established, they can continually exist.But a sensitive period, period of time when early embryonic developmet and PGC development are happening, is excluded, since all epigenetic marks are cleared and reset.If a drug is treated during these sensitive period,we can draw uncertain conclusion whether an expected(hypomethylation and acetylation)alteration is eastablished,and we surely would not want this worry.</div>
