    <div class="field-value">For many years it has been thought that DNA methylation at CpG island is associated with gene repression but  recently it is started to assume that normal methylation is responsible for <span>cell differentiation and embryonic development,moreover it is assumed that some methylations are associatd with mediating gene expression.<br /><br /></span><p>Several ways DNA methylation of CpG could be disrupted. For instance, Higher methylation rates makes DNA more tightly packed around histone and eventually transcriptional can't bind and lower methylation makes DNA molecule loosely packed around histone so that more trascriptional factor can bind that ultimately lead to more cell division. </p><p>Due to hypermethylation at CpG island,
transcriptional factors like Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P16_(gene)">p16</a>,
a cell-cycle inhibitor; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53">p53</a>,
a tumor suppressor gene; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-6-methylguanine-DNA_methyltransferase">MGMT</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair">DNA repair</a> gene; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenomatous_polyposis_coli">APC</a>, a cell cycle regulator; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLH1">MLH1</a>,
a DNA-repair gene; and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA1">BRCA1</a>, another DNA-repair gene is silenced that leads uncontrolled
cell division. Hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides in other parts of the
genome leads to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome_instability&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome_instability&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">chromosome instability</a> due to mechanisms such
as loss of imprinting and reactivation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposable_element">transposable elements</a>.</p><p><br /> Reason for intragenic (within gene body) methylation is that it may increase accuracy of splicing. Intragenic and repetitive sequence  do not need to express a gene, so DNA methylation keep them silenced.<br /></p><p> hypomethylation is a way by which intragenic and repitive regions could be disrupted.</p><p><br /></p><p>Loss of methyaltion can make them bind with transcription factor and lead them to express gene that ultimately cause cancer. In cancer repitive sequence is not lessened as cell divides further so cell won't be older and divisions continues.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The hypermethylation of the H19 promoter on the paternal allele plays a vital role in allowing the expression of the paternal allele of IGF2.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H19_(gene)#cite_note-Gao-21">[21]</a><span> In </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNMT" title="Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNMT">DNMT</a>-null mice, the paternal allele of IGF2 is also silenced as the paternal H19 promoter is no longer methylated and repressed.<span>A reason for the close coupling of H19 and IGF2 expression may be that they share the same 3’ gene enhancer.</span><span> When this 3’ enhancer was deleted, researchers Leighton </span><i>et al.</i><span> found decreased H19 and IGF2 RNA expressions in the gut, liver and kidney; however, the methylation status of these genes were not affected by the deleted enhancer</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">decitabine is hypomethylating agent.<br /><br />Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting methyltransferase.<br /><br />Decitabine inhibit methylation thus DNA become less tightly packed around histone eventually genes could be expressed like tumor suppressor gene that can kill tumor cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells<br /><br /></span><span>a time or stage in a person's development when they are more responsive to certain stimuli and quicker to learn particular skills.<br /></span> <br /><br /></div>
