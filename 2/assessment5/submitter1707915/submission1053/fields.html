    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a well balanced normal evolutionarily conserved process which involves covalent addition of a methyl group by methyl transferases to cytosine residue within clusters of CpG di-nucleotides called CpG islands. meCpG in a CpG island is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure, it occurs bound by methylated CpG binding proteins e.g. MeCP1 &amp; 2 which have a DNA binding domain and transcriptional repression domain. Cancer due to epigenetic reason arises mainly due to aberrant CpG methylation,
resulting in genome wide hypomethylation and gene-specific hypermethylation,
especially in the promoter region of certain genes. Hyper M<span>ethylation within promoters
serve to turn off critical genes that could otherwise suppress tumorigenesis as observed in tumor suppressor genes. On the other hand cancer-associated DNA hypomethylation is
as prevalent as cancer-linked hypermethylation leading to activation
of proto-oncogenes. The intergenic and repetitive elements are generally hypermethylated and </span>highly tissue specific i.e., different tissues display different methylation patterns. These regions are very important for maintaining efficient genome stability, and methylation serves as a conserved process which monitors the same. During cancer this methylation pattern is disrupted, the hypermethylated regions get de-methylated leading to expression of many genes like oncogenes which have to be silenced under normal circumstances. This change in methylation leads to cancer formation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting
is an important mechanism wherein monoallelic gene expression based on parent
of origin is observed.  Imprinting is
controlled by Imprint Control Regions (ICR) by methylation and
exists in gene clusters.  At the ICR of H19/Igf2 locus
one such gene cluster, methylation of the paternal allele and no methylation for the maternal allele
is observed. The CTCF protein, an insulating molecule known to insulate
IGF2 from downstream enhancers  bind to the allele on the
maternal strand leading to downstream enhancers to act on H19 as a result. Whereas CTCF complex does not bind to the paternal allele due to the methyl marks, leading to silencing of the H19 gene, as the enhancers drive expression of Igf2 instead. Observation
in a normal cellular process is normal dose of both H19 from maternal strand, and Igf2 from paternal strand. However, when
this ICR becomes hypermethylated, both strands appear to be of paternal origin and get
expressed as such. That is, the system gets a double dose of (growth­ promoting) Igf2 (as well as no dose of H19). This is associated with Wilm's tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a DNA de-methylating agent belonging to class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors disrupts the existing methylation pattern of the cell contributing to hypomethylation of DNA. It is one among the two drugs in the market used in treatment of myelodysplatic syndrome (conditions under which the bone marrow produces deformed blood cells), which is a precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia. Decatabine will target and lyse the methylated cytosine, thereby demethylating an already methylated region.Tumors are unknown to have hypermethylated tumor suppresor and DNA repair genes respectively. These hypermethylated genes can be targeted using this mechanism, this Anti­tumour effect has been thus been linked to reactivation of the already epigenetically suppressed silenced genes, induced by the hypomethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an effective target in treatments because it
can be manipulated leading to changes in defective gene expression.
The differential methylation status of genes can be good diagnostic and prognostic
markers. Drugs influencing the methylation status are especially used in
cancers as a routine treatment procedure. These changes have enduring effects as the DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis. However, these global interventions may
interfere with ordinary functioning of the system, especially during critical periods,
a period of time where extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs,
e.g., during developmental stages. In particular, it would be inadvisable to
prescribe these treatments to pregnant mothers (including a few months before conception) as
a lot of reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the formation of
gametes (both male and female).</p></div>
