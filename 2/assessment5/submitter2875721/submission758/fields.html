    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation occurs to cytosine residues (5mC) within CpG islands and is catalised by DNA methyltransferases.<br />In normal cells, DNA is methylated at the introns of the genes, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements. However, CpG islands that are found at the gene promoters are usually unmethylated  in normal cells, while the rest of the genome is methylated suppressing transposable element activity, as DNA methylation indicates genomic stability. On the contrary, in the cancer cells, the introns of the genes, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hypomethylated and the CpG islands are methylated. Specifically, in cancer is observed locus specific DNA hypermethylation and genome wide DNA hypomethylation, unlike in normal cells.<br /><br /><b><i>Sources:</i></b><br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22546286">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22546286</a><br /></li><li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=epigenomics+of+cancer+-+emerging+new+concepts" title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=epigenomics+of+cancer+-+emerging+new+concepts">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=epigenomics+of+cancer+-+emerging+new+concepts</a><br /></li><li>Epigenetic control of gene expression lectures</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster is located on human chromosome 11. On the paternal allele, the imprinted control region is methylated, whereas on the maternal allele the imprinted control region is unmethylated. Tis means that it is paternally imprinted. <br />On the maternal allele, where the imprinted control region is unmethylated the CTCF, an insulator protein, bounds on it and insulated Igf2 from downstream enhancers, because of chromatin looping. On the other hand, on the paternal allele the CTCF binding is blocked due to DNA methylation at the imprinted control region. So, without the CTCF binding, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence, and the enhancers can access Igf2 to activate.<br />In Wilms tumor, there is overexpression of Igf2, as a result of imprinted control region hypermethylation on the maternal allele as well. This happens due to loss of imprinting. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine and Vidaza belong to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, which are approved by the FDA for use in the myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. <br />Decitabine is a nucleoside analoue, which binds to DNMTs irreversibly, after their incorporation into DNA. This means that this drug is cell replicating dependent. So in cancer, because of the tumour cells' capacity to divide more rapidly than the normal cells, are going to be more affected.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer. Drugs that alter DNA methylation can affect the patients beyond the period of drug treatment, because epigenetic alterations are reversible. So when there is an epigenetic alteration in tumour cells, the drug that is used to reverse this alteration might be able to sustain that drug ability, even beyond the drug treatment. <br />A sensitive period is when epigenetic reprogramming happens. Then, epigenetic marks are erased and then it is reprogrammed to occur again. It happens in two periods, during pre-implantation (early development) and during germ cell development. Treating patients during those periods would br inadvisable, because it could alter the epigenetic programming of those cells and could lead to malignancies. </div>
