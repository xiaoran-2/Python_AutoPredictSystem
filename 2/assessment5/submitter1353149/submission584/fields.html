    <h1>Submission 584 from Anon (session_user_id: be35e110b63567a7d408bb3b31416b40a7ccc7b6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylation agent (also called a hypomethylation agent). It's action is via inhibition of DNA methyltransferase enzymes (e.g., DNMT). Basically decitabine reduces methylation of promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes by being incorporated into DNA strands. It "seems" according to the article that decitabine alters tumor cells 'in some way' that makes them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy in solid tumors.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The enduring effects happen in the somatic cell division. Once the demethylation effect is performed, the subsequent daughter cells will remain "demethylated." A sensitive period is when epigenetic reprogramming happens and results in the rapid and active demethylation of the genome. It occurs by dehydroxilation. The epigenetic marks are at their lowest point at the blastocyst stage and are re-established after implantation. We know from our class videos that there are two sensitive periods; the Primordial Germ Cell development and embryonic cell development. Treating patients during sensitive periods may keep the reestablishment of epigenetic marks from happening. One should expect severe impacts to the patient to the point of death.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands is an epigenetic signal that cells use to silence genes to support among other things X chromosome inactivation and preservation of chromosome stability. This methylation happens by converted the cytosine bases of eukaryotic DNA to 5-methylcytosine by DNMT enzymes. The altered cystine residues are adjacent to a guanine nucleotide which results in 2 methylated cystine residue sitting diagonally to each other on opposing DNA strands.  In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated which causes gene silencing (in many cases tumor suppressor cells are silenced). This happens for environmental and age-related reasons. Aging results in loss of global DNA methylation  and heterogeneity in genome-wide methylation patterns. This causes genomic instability which is a hallmark of cancer. The repetitive portion of the genome is heavily methylated while most CpG islands remain unmethylated in normal cells. Cancer cells exhibit widespread loss of intergenic DNA methylation with gain of methylation at many gene-associated CpG islands. Cancer cells exhibit hypomethylation of intergenic regions which normally comprise the majority of a cell's methyl-cytosine content<span>. Consequently, transposable elements may become active and contribute to the genomic instability observed in cancer cells.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally IGF2 is an
imprinted gene that is expressed only from the paternal allele (paternal alleles are methylated which allows igf2 to be expressed, maternal alleles are unmethylated which silences igf2 expression). However, in the majority of Wilms' tumors, there is relaxation of imprinting; therefore, the maternal allele is also expressed. Thus there is an over expression of igf2 that causes methylation of H19 promoter which turns off H19 causing increased (i.e., uncontrolled) cell growth (which is the hallmark of cancer).<br /></div>
