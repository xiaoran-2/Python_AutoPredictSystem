    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a key feature of
cancer phenotypes. In normal mammalian somatic cells and to a lesser extent,
embryonic stem cells, the modification of the C5 position of the cytosine base
is seen in 70-80% of CpG dinucleotides. This epigenetic mechanism is partly
responsible for phenomena such as imprinting, X-inactivation and the formation
of chromatin.</p>

<p>In cancer, there is genome-wide loss of
DNA methylation, and regional gain of DNA methylation in promoter CpG islands. Genome
wide hypomethylation promotes DNA instability and deregulation of tissue
specific and imprinted genes. </p>

<p>CpG islands in normal somatic cells are
largely unmethylated, In contrast, CpG islands in the promoter regions of
tumour cells have been found to be hypermethylated, which corresponds to
silencing of the corresponding gene. Frequently, tumour suppressor genes
promoter genes involving cell cycling, apoptosis, or DNA repair. </p>

<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions
are responsible for increasing the fidelity of gene transcription by reducing
start sites or anti-sense transcription. In cancer, hypomethylation of these
sites can lead to the formation of cryptic promoters and expression of
surrounding genes.</p>

<p>Methylation of repetitive elements are
responsible for genomic stability. In cancer, translocations leading to aberrant
gene expression by promoter/ gene recombinations.</p>

<p>CpG island hypermethylation and
intergenic hypomethylation is found to be increased as cancer progresses.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is the epigenetic phenomenon
in which certain genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin manner. The H19/Igf2
imprinting locus serves as an example of imprinting leading to carcinogenesis. In
the normal somatic cell, the paternal allele of the H19/Ighf2 cluster the
imprinting control region (ICR) and the H19 promoter is methylated and allows
enhancers to access the Igf2 gene. Conversely, the maternal ICR is
unmethylated, allowing CTCF binding and H19 expression, which in turn, silences
maternal IGf2 expression. </p>

<p>In the Wilm’s tumour, there is aberrant
methylation of the maternal ICR, which in turn, silences H19 and promotes the
transcription of the maternal derived Igf2 gene. This leads to twice the
expression of Igf2, which promotes tumour genesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs such as decitabine and
azacytidine, inhibit DNA methyl transferases and hence the activity of enzymes
that methylate DNA during replication. This altered epigenome is heritable and
therefore, subsequent generations of tumour cells will have this altered
epigenome. The expression of genes which confer chemotherapy resistance may be repressed,
perhaps leading to a more chemo sensitive phenotype.</p>

<p><span>Certain phases of mammalian cell
development are sensitive to inhibition of epigenetic controlling enzymes.
Disruption to the action of these enzymes can have prolonged, or irreversible
effects on the epigenome. Often this has effects on normal cellular differentiation
and development. This is known as a sensitive period. Imprinting and epigenetic
reprogramming occur during germ cell development and early embryonic
development.  In theory, this could lead
to birth defects or abortion of labour.</span></p>

<p>Therefore, it would be ill advised to
treat patients, which this class of drugs during pregnancy or couples
attempting to bear children.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl-transferase
inhibitor. Decitabine is a cytosine nucleoside analog that then incorporated in
DNA, inhibits further DNA methylation by irreversibly binding DNMT. It is
therefore, replication dependent and acts to demethylate DNA.</p>

<p>As a consequence, expression of
aberrantly silenced genes including tumour suppressor genes is regained or
increased, reducing tumour genesis or growth. Decitabine has been approved by
the FDA for treatment of haematological malignancies.</p>
