    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug that is used in the treatment of Acute Myelogenous Leukamia. It acts on DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and therefore belongs to the class of drugs called <b>DNA methyltransferase inhibitors</b>. <br />Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue of cytodine. Becoming incorporated into DNA is binds irreversibly to DMNT resulting in <strong>hypomethylation</strong>, reduced methylation. Because Decitabine inclusion into DNA is replication dependant, cells replicating at a higher rate (i.e. Cancer) will suffer more from decreased DNA synthesis due to DNMT binding therefore having an anti-tumour effect.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is altered in numerous parts of the genome during cancer. <br />CpG islands, gene promoter regions, are normally unmethylated regardless of the activity of their associated gene. As cancer progresses to metastasis CpG islands experience increasing levels of methylation (<strong>hypermethylation)</strong>. This methylation silences genes involved with constraining cellular growth. By silencing "tumour suppressor genes" via CpG island methylation cancer progresses at an increased rate.<br />While CpG islands experience hypermethylation during cancer. Broadly, the genome become hypomethylated i.e. methylation marks are removed. This hypomethylation is especially apparent in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Normally methylated and therefore silenced. Hypomethylation of these repetitive elements leads to illegitimate recombination and thereby reciprocal tranlocations. Demethylation of cryptic promoters may disrupt the transcription of nearby genes. Demethylation of transposable elements allows for their activation and "jumping" to other sites within the genome. <br />This added disruption to the genome increases instability allowing cancer to progress due to the interruption of tumour suppressing genes. Activation of oncogenes (cell growth promoters) may also occur due to their hypomethylation and therefore greater cell proliferation.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations to DNA methylation at Imprint Control Regions (ICR) can result in cancer because many imprinted genes are involved with either promoting cell growth or its restriction.<br />An excellent example is Wilm's tumour, a childhood cancer of the kidneys.<br />In normal cells only the paternal allele has a methylated ICR stopping attachment of the CTCF element leading to upstream expression of the <i>Igf2 </i>gene. The maternal allele has an unmethylated ICR allowing for attachment of the CTCF causing downstream expression of the <i>H19 </i>gene.<br />Loss of imprinting occurs in Wilm's tumour due to hypermethylation of the maternal allele's ICR. This leads to the maternal<i> </i>allele expressing <i>lgf2 </i>(instead of <em>H19</em>)<i> </i>along with the paternal allele. This over-expression of <i>Igf2</i>  promotes cell growth resulting in cancer.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations to DNA methylation due to the effect of drugs could persist in daughter cells due to conservation of changes enacted by DNMT1. The effect or penetrance of these changes can be amplified if the cell is in a "sensitive period". Sensitive periods are times when the epigenetic marks are removed or being actively remodeled. These periods include during <strong>early embryonic development</strong> and <strong>primordial germ cell development</strong>. It would therefore be extremely inadvisable to treat pregnant women with drugs that alter the epigenome. Caution should also be applied to treating the very young any changes that may occur would be present in the individual for longer.<br /><br /></div>
