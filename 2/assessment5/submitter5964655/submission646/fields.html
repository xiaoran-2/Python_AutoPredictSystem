    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In general, DNA
methylation is altered in cancer. We find instances of hypomethylation that
exists genome-wide. While hypermethylation acts on tumor supression genes. The
effect the the altered methylation is context-dependent with different cancer
type being driven by specific methylation profiles.<span><br /><br />
A normal cell has hypomethylated CpG islands.
While having methylation at the repetitive elements, intergenic regions and
within gene introns. A cancer cell has a higher likelihood of methylation
at the CpG islands. While the repetitive elements, intergenic regions and
gene introns tend to be hypomethylated.<br /><br />
The consequence of the hypomethylation depends
on its specific locations (most common at the repeats) and is a general rule
for all tumor types. Hypomethylation of the repeats can cause them to jump
around and cause aberrant outcomes which leads to genomic instability. This is
a common characteristic of cancers.<br /><br /><span>The presence of CpG island hypermethylation can
be one of the Knudson "hits" that contributes to the development of
cancer be acting to silence tumor suppresion genes.</span></span></p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting can be affected by either Hyper- or Hypo- methylation at imprint control regions in cancer. The specific impact is related to the actual function of the gene whether growth promoting or grown suppressing. This disruption occurs to both alleles. <br /><br />With regards to the lgf2 expression status, a normal cell will have methylation on the paternal allele resulting in H19 being silent while lgf2 is expressed. In contrast, the maternal allele is unmethylated resulting in the enhancers acting on H19 while lgf2 is silent.<br /><br />When the ICR is hypermethylated, H19 is silenced and a doubledose of lgf2 is expressed. Given that Igf2 is growth promoting, the result is Wilm's tumor, a type of kidney cancer found primarily in children.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA
de-methylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which are
the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine functions
by hypomethylating DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. <span>Decitabine gets incorporated into DNA during replication or RNA
during transcription thereby causing demethylation in that
sequence. This adversely affects how cell regulatory proteins bind to the DNA/RNA substrate.</span></p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA
methylation can have lasting effects beyond the treatment period due to the
epigenetic marks being mitotically heritable. Therfore any epigenetic changes
brought about by the drug will be passed onto to the daugther cells of the
origianlly altered cell.<span><br /><br />
Sensitive periods are those in which epigenetic
markers are being established.<br /><br /><span>Treating patients during sensitive periods has
the potential for a genomically global impact that affects the patients germ
cell development.For this reason, treating patients during these periods is
inadvisable.</span></span></p></div>
