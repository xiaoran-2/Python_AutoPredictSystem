    <div class="field-value"> -DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic  phenomena such as imprinting X chromosome inativation or the formation of heterochromatin.<br />-Generally,DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression<br />-There is CpG  islands which  are found in about 60%  of promoter. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state.<br />- In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylation which causes silencing of the underlying gene.<br />DNA methylation<br />   locus specific DNA hypermethylation.<br />        CpG islands and CpG islands shore of tumor( suppressor genes)<br />        ICRs -loss of imprinting<br />   Genome -wide DNA hypomethylation <br />        repetitive regions <br />        CpG poor promoter<br />        ICRs loss of imprinting<br /><br />Long range-silencing  of repetitive sequences  and formation of silent heterochromation but also DNA access for transcription in euchromatin or DNA repetitive are dependent on epigenetic mechanism including DNA methylation,histone modification and remodeling and non coding RNA.They are interrelated.<br /> Normally hypermethylation at these sites is associated with greater genomic stability, so hypomethylation during cancer leads to copying errors such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the chromosomes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 and H19 exhibit  parent of origin specific monoallelic expression .H19 is expressed from the maternal chromosome and IGF2 from  the paternal. The two genes share enhancer elements  and monoallelic expression of both genes is dependent on cis-acting sequences upstream of the H19 promoter.The ICR at IGF2 and H19 is normally methylation on the paternal  allele. Methylation  is excluded from the maternal allele by CTCF binding.<br />In WILMS Tumor ( embryological tumour of childhood) allele loss at 11p15 has been shown to be specific for the maternally inherited allele,the significance of which is demonstrated by the pattern of imprinting of genes within the region of common allele loss.The insulin-like growth factor 2 gene (IGF2)<br />is  maternally imprinted ( paternally expressed) and so maternal allele loss leads to either no change in effective gene dosage,or to increased gene dosage if there is associated paternal duplication.<br />Hyper and hypomethylation at the IGF2-H19 imprinting control region(ICR) result in reciprocal changes in IGF2-H19 expression and the two contrasting growth disorders.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is belonged to hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNAmethyltransferase.<br />It  indicated for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursor of acute  myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine, the anti­tumour effect has<div>been linked to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor supressor genes, induced by the</div><div>hypothemylation.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes in DNA  methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomie instability and derugulation of tissue  specific and imprinting  genes and on the other hand  silencing  of tumor suppressor  genes controlling cell cycle apoptosis or DNA repair by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands.<br /> The sensitive period is the period when the treatment has to be performed and the reponse expected is efficacy<br />The sensitive periods of development is the period  when the tumor has developed quickly and the cells are sensible  to the development. it would be inadvisable to<div>prescribe these treatments to pregnant mothers ( before conception) as</div><div>a lot of reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the formation of gametes.</div>  </div>
