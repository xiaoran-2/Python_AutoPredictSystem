    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell CpG islands are usually protected from methylation, which would lead to silencing of the gene by forming repressive chromatin structures or inhibiting the binding of transcription factors to the DNA. However, in a cancer cell CpG islands become hypermethylated. This can occur in a tumour suppressor gene, leading to silencing of a gene that would usually decrease proliferation of the cell. CpG island hypermethylation can therefore contribute to the multiple hits needed for a cell to become cancerous, as per the Knudson hypothesis. Two examples of single genes in which this can occur are<em> BRCA1</em> in breast cancer and <em>RB</em> in retinoblastoma.<br /><br />Conversely, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in a normal cell, leading to silencing of these elements. The methylation of intergenic regions may conserve genomic stability, as DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) null cells display abnormalities due to genomic instability, such as deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions. The methylation, and therefore silencing, of repetitive elements prevents translocation of repeats and also prevents transcriptional interference from strong promoters in repeats that could read into downstream genes. In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally hypomethylated, leading to genomic instability. Illegitimate recombination is seen between repeats, as these regions tend to be very similar between chromosomes and their hypomethylated state allows their alignment due to opened chromatin. Transposition of repeats is also seen, which disrupts the coding of neighbouring genes. Finally, hypomethylation allows the activation of cryptic promoters due to the open chromatin state, which also disrupts neighbouring genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><em>Igf2</em> is a paternally imprinted gene. This is due to the methylation, and therefore silencing, of <em>H19</em>'s imprint control region (ICR) on the paternal allele, which is located downstream of <em>Igf2</em>. The methylation from the ICR spreads to <em>H19</em>. This prevents the enhancers downstream of <em>H19</em> from binding to <em>H19</em>, and so they bind to<em> Igf2</em> further upstream, leading to the expression of <em>Igf2</em>. On the maternal allele, CTCF, an insulator protein, binds to the ICR as it is not methylated. This insulates<em> Igf2</em> from the enhancers, which instead bind to and activate <em>H19</em>. <em>H19</em> is therefore maternally imprinted.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour the ICR of the maternal allele is hypermethylated, which causes the maternal allele to act in the same way as the paternal allele. This leads to an overexpression of <em>Igf2</em>, which is a growth promoting gene. Overexpression of a growth promoting gene leads to excessive cell proliferation, and is another example of one of the multiple hits in the Knudson hypothesis. Overexpression of <em>Igf2</em> is commonly seen in the early, pre-neoplastic stage of Wilm's tumour.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNMTis (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors) and so is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is FDA approved for use in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). By inhibiting DNMTs, the enzymes that transfer methyl groups to a nucleoside, DNMTis reduce the level of methylation in hypermethylated areas. However, the drug has a narrow therapeutic range, with DNA demethylation and anti-neoplastic effects shown at a lower dose, but not at higher, toxic doses at which its mechanism is nonspecific. DNMTis work by acting as a nucleoside analogue, which means they can be incorporated into the DNA during replication and irreversibly bind DNMTs, which can then no longer function. This treatment is therefore useful in haematological malignancies such as AML in which tumour suppressor genes are silenced by hypermethylation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, are by definition <em>mitotically heritable</em> gene expression changes which are not due to changes in DNA sequence. Mitotic heritability means that when a cell divides, the epigenetic changes are passed on to the daughter cells. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable as DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) recognises hemi-methylated DNA (which is methylated on one strand) during DNA replication, and transfers methyl groups to the unmethylated strand. Therefore, drugs that alter DNA methylation would have a mitotically heritable effect, and this is how the effects would last beyond the treatment period.<br /><br />Sensitive periods are developmental periods in which epigenetic reprogramming occurs: methylation of the maternal and paternal genome is cleared and methylation of repeats is maintained. One sensitive period occurs at the blastocyst stage, and another occurs during primordial germ cell (PGC) development. During PGC development, methylation of imprinted genes is also cleared. It would be inadvisable to treat patients with drugs such as DNMTis during these periods as this could also cause disruption of DNMT in the cells undergoing epigenetic reprogramming, leading to hypomethylation following clearing, and potentially imprinting disorders.<br /></div>
