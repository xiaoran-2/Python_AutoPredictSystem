    <h1>Submission 954 from Anon (session_user_id: 0cf32df67a2f2df3a693c11940ca2cbf833eacc8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug used for myelodysplastic syndromes. It belongs to DNA-demethylating agents (it's a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor), and it targets DNA proteins (histones) which regulate the expression of cell growth regulation genes, to remove methyl groups from them. Since methyl groups in histones silence the expression of specific genes, a DNA-demethylating agent (like Decitabine) would activate the expression of these genes. In myelodysplastics syndromes, certain histones are overmethylated, silencing the expression of tumour-suppressor genes. The role of Decitabine, is to demethylate these histones, inhibiting tumour growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, DNA methylation at CpG islands allows cells to have genomic stability, hypomethylating DNA regions followed by CpG islands. In cancer, there is hypermethylation of these promoters, which increases tumour progression. It does by inhibiting the expression of tumour-supressor genes, therefore dysregulating normal cell growth. The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to silence them, and in cancer, these become unmethylated, causing genome instability and abnormal cell development.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated, allowing enhancers to act on Igf2 and expressing it. The maternal allele, by opposite, has an unmethylated H19/Igf2 cluster, meaning that the enhancers will act on H19, with no expression of Igf2. In Wilm's tumour, there's a loss of imprinting in this cluster, showing methylation on both alleles, allowing expression of Igf2 on both of them. Since Igf2 is a growth promoter gene, the double dose of this expression leads to dysregulation of cell growth in Wilm's tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">One of the main characteristics of epigenetics, is that all epigenetic change can be inherited. Therefore, it can be transmitted from mother cells to daughter cells, and we would see its effects along time in a determinate tissue. This may be the case of the lasting effects of epigenetic drugs in treated tumour cells, especially since some drugs have a replication dependant mechanism. A sensitive period is a lapse of time in cell development where, in order to achieve tissue differentiation or maturity to gametes, epigenetic marks are erased or largely reduced. More exactly, these occur during pre-implantation development and germ cell development. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable since epigenetic marks are more susceptible to alteration, and it could happen that drugs alter other epigenetic targets, which could lead to a dysregulation of the normal epigenetic machinery and therefore, to diseases.</div>
