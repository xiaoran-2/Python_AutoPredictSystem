    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are frequently found in promoters of a large number of
genes (60%), these CpG islands that are usually methylated in other regions of the
DNA, are normally unmethylated when they are located in promoters. However,
this approach differs in cancer cells, where CpG islands tend to be
hypermethylated, hence the underlying gene is silenced.</p>

<p>Moreover,
as a consequence of changing the normal gene expression pattern, tumor cells
are able to induce genomic instability, follow by deregulation of tissue
specific and imprinted genes by activating oncogenes produced by
hypomethyilation of their CpG islands. Furthermore, hypermethylation was found
in tumor suppressor genes, silencing their expression, which normal functions
are to control the cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair.</p>

<p>Methylation
in repetitive elements is highly related with genomic stability. By silencing
parts of the genes, that, can lead to an incorrect start or a splicing. Also, avoiding
transposon to be transcribed, in order to prevent the movement of genomic
material. Another feature is that can prevent transcriptional interference from
strong promoters and eventually, avoid recombination between repetitive elements.
</p>

<p>By
contrast, methylation founded in repetitive elements is proposed that could
serve as a transcriptional noise repressor from alternative start sites, which
function is to inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and is relates
to replication timing. This function is disrupted in certain tumor cells by directed
hypomethylation at satellite repeats. Also, methylation on repetitive elements
prevents genomic instability.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In maternal
allele there is no methylation at ICR, CTCF proteins insulate Igf2 from downstream
enhancers, allowing them to act promoting the expression of H19. On the other
hand, paternal allele is methylated at ICR blocking CTCF protein binding; subsequently,
this methylation spreads to H19 promoters. This mechanism allows the enhancers
to promote the expression of Igf2. In this situation, normal dosage of Igf2 is
expressed. Fortunately, this dosage is not enough to cause tumourogenesis. </p>

<p><span>The
different expressions of maternal and paternal allele seem to play an important
role in Weidmann syndrome. In this disease, the maternal allele acts like a paternal
allele, causing the overexpression of Igf2, whose overexpression is a proven
oncogene that promotes cell growth. Studies about this mechanisms point that
Igf2 is involved in some kinase pathways that are control metabolism, growth, differentiation
and apoptosis, functions that when are altered are highly related with cancer. The
consequences are an overgrowth in early states of life, large tongue syndrome
and predisposition to develop tumours in early phases of life but not involving
adult tumours. <br /></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that can induce demethylation. Decitabine in cells acts
as an analogue of cytidine, substituting this molecule in DNA and RNA during
replication and transcription respectively. </p>

<p>Proteins that act as a methyltransferases cannot methylate this drug; hence
the DNA remains unmethylated, no longer allowing these proteins to access DNA
in order to incorporate a methyl group. </p>

<p>The consequences of its application is to return to normal condition
those tumor-repressor genes that in tumor cells can be found hypermethylated,
supressing basic functions that prevent cells for uncontrolled growth and so
on. </p>

<p>In conclusion, tumor-suppressor genes are hypermethylated in a large
number of tumors, as a consequence these genes are silenced, and hence by
providing a drug that can demethylate these genes, allowing its activation,
cancer cells damage can be reverted. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A sensitive period is the moment of exposure to epigenetic reprogramming as are, pre-implantation development and germ cell development. During this stage, paternal an maternal genomes are cleared and reset. On the other hand imprinting genes are only removed and reset during germe cell development. <br /><br /><br /></div>
