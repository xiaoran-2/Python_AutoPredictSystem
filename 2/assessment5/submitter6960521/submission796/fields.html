    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells the DNA at CpG islands is unmethylated, while in a cancerous cell they have become hypermethylated. This results in the silencing of the underlying genes, for example tumour suppressor genes. <br />The DNA methylation in intragenic regions and repetitive elements prevents genomic instability; however in cancer, genome-wide hypomethylation occurs which then demethylates these regions, resulting in genomic instability which can result in karyotypic abnormalities such as reciprocal translocations or deletions.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster on the paternal allele is hypermethylated. This allows the enhancers to act on Igf2, which causes Igf2 to be expressed.  On the other hand, the ICR region is unmethylated on the maternal allele, which allows an insulator molecule CTCF to bind to the ICR. The enhancers then act on H19 and not on Igf2, which results in Igf2 not being expressed.  <br />In Wilm's tumour, the ICR on the maternal allele is hypermethylated, and therefore the ICR does not bind the insulator molecule CTCF. This allows the enhancers to act on Igf2, causing Igf2 to be expressed and H19 is no longer expressed.  As a result of the loss of imprinting, Igf2 is then expressed by both alleles. This contributes to cancer as Igf2 is a growth promoting factor and H19 functions to slow cell growth, and as a result of the excessive Igf2 and decreased H19, uncontrolled cell growth can occur. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors called "DNA methyltransferase inhibitors" (DNMti). Decitabine results in the hypomethylation of DNA as a result of its incorportation into the DNA during cell replication, and preventing DNA methyltransferase 1 from adding methyl groups to the daughter DNA strand. Thus Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by removing the methylation marks from tumour cells, causing the underlying genes to be expressed, and thus allowing the proteins which control normal cell growth to be produced. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a heritable mark, which means that it is carried over during cell division, and thus can last for the life time of the cell.  Sensitive periods, are those during which the epigenetic marks are being laid down, such as during germ cell development and early embryonic development.  Treating patients with drugs which affect the epigenome during these sensitive periods will have a life-long effect as these drugs affect not just a specific target, but rather the entire epigenome.  These marks are heritable for the life time of the person as a result of the DNA methyl transferases, and thus alterations as a result of treatment may have a detrimental effect on the person receiving the treatment.</div>
