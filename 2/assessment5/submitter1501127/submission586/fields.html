    <div class="field-value"><p>














</p><p>DNA methylation is related with
four different epigenetic phenomena; impinting, X-chromosome
inactivation,formation of heterochromatin and methylation of DNA regions.</p>

<p>Methylation at the 5 position of
cytosine has the specific effect of reducing gene expresión.</p>

<p><span>Depending of the  regiones and alterations in DNA
methylation  (hypo or
hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes
or overexpression of growth promoting genes. </span></p>

<p><span>CpG islands  are represented in a great proportion
in the promoters  of tumor
supresión genes. For this reason if CpGs are hypermethylated, like in cancer, this
situation causes silencing of the underlaying genes.  That means that genes of tumor supresión genes will be
silenced and tumor cells would continue growing.   </span></p>

<p><span>In intergenic regions and
repetitive elements there are two posibilities: hypo or hypermethylation,
that  can result in loss of
expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting
genes.</span></p>

<p>In some kinds of cancer,
intergenic regions and repetitive elements are undermethylated and this
situation induces their activation and transposition leading to chromosomal
inestability. </p>

<p><span>But in other types of cancer, eg
Wilm´s tumor, intergenic regions are hypermethylated and those hypermethylation
induces lgf2 overexpression. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/lgf2 is a imprinted
cluster where in normal situations is methylated on the paternal
allele and unmethyllated on the maternal one.</p>

<p>When the paternal allele
is methylated, enhancers can act over lgf2 and express it.   </p>

<p>When the maternal  allele is unmethylated, CTCF binds to
its insulator element, and enhancers will act on H19 but Igf2 will not be expresses.</p>

<p>In Wilms’ tumor, both
maternal and paternal alleles are methylated. That means lgf2 will be
overexpressed: there will be a doble dose of Igf2 compared with normal cell .</p>

<p>Since Igf2 is a growth
promoter associated wthe Wilm,s tumor, the overexpression of this promoter will
contribuye to tumor growth. <span>   </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, is a DNA-demethylating agent. <br /><br /><span>When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth.  When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. <br /><br /></span><span>Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be two ways.<br /><br />One way that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA, </span><span>inhibiting DNA methyltransferasa,  By this process, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</span><p>Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites.  Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells, once erased the epigenetic changes will not return.<br /><br />Sensitive periods are special moments on the development of tumors where they are especially susceptible to epigenetic drugs. <br /><br />There are two main sensitive periods: at the beginning, before treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs, when epigenetic drugs altered the tumor cells in a way that make them more susceptible to standard therapy. A<span>nd secondly when the tumor is big, that mens it's hard to treat, and the epigenetic drug helps chemotherapeutic drugs to penetrate the tumors.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /> </span><br /> </div>
