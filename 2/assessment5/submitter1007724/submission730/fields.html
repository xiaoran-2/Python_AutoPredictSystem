    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands repress the expression of the
gene they precede. The disruption of DNA methylation in cancer can cause an
hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes (silencing them) and/or an
hypomethylation of oncogenes in the case of CpG poor promoters (deregulating
them). This altered epigenetic pattern of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes
contributes to the appearance of tumours.<br /><br />
DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contribute to the
correct functioning of the cell through several non-coding RNA players. Tumours
have hypomethylated repeats/ intergenic intervals, and this produces
genomic instability (illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of
repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption
to neighbouring genes). This genomic instability deregulates the correct
functioning of the suppressor genes and oncogenes, contributing to cancer.</p><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNMT inhibitors, a class of nucleoside
analogues that irreversibly bind to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methyltransferase">DNA
methyltransferase</a> after they are incorporated into DNA. This process
demethylates the DNA. As hypermethylation of CpG islands and shores are an
important cause of tumour appearance, the demethylation reverses this effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenome is essential to the regulation of the
organization of DNA mechanisms. Its mechanisms need to be stably
maintained during cell divisions. The modification of the epigenome will have
consequences in the posterior cell replications. This is the reason why it is
important not to treat patients during sensitive periods (such as the
production of germ cells or the first days of a fetus), where the epigenome of
the few cells is susceptible to be modified and can carry any modification of
the epigenome during the rest of the life of the carrier of this primordial
cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele of
the H19 gene has a methylated imprinting<span> control region (ICR),
blocking the expression of this gene and allowing the expression of
the gene Igf2 through enhancers. In contrast, the maternal allele expresses
the H19 gene, but not the Igf2 gene because of the hypomethylation of this ICR.
In Wilm’s
tumour, the ICR is hypermthylated, provoking an expression of Igf2 in both alleles.
This gene is a growth factor. Consequently, his overexpression eases the
formation of neoplastic tissue.</span></p></div>
