    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is altered in cancer in two main ways.  The first is hypermethylation at specific loci in the genome, often at CpG islands.  In normal cells the CpG islands -- where gene promoters are found -- are not methylated, allowing transcription machinery to bind and express that gene.  If a CpG island is methylated, the gene will not be expressed.  In cancer, the CpG islands that encode for tumor suppression are methylated, meaning that tumor suppression is inhibited, and tumors are allowed to grow unchecked.  DNA Methylation is also mitotically inheritable, so all new daughter cells will contain the same methylation, meaning tumor suppression is inhibited in all daughter cells.<br /><br />The second way DNA methylation is altered in cancer is by hypomethylation at introns, intergenic regions, and at repetitive elements.  These locations are methylated in normal cells, but become genome-wide de-methylated in cancer cells.  The hypomethylation of these regions leads to genetic instabiility by activating genes which should not be expressed, causing illegitimate recombination between alleles of a specific gene, and activating promotors which disrupt neighboring genes.        <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changing of the methylation pattern at imprint control regions (ICRs) -- either hypermethylation or hypomethylation -- results in either the repression or expression, respectively, of the imprinted gene.  In the H19/lgf2 cluster of the paternal allele of a normal cell, the ICR is methylated, repressing the lncRNA  Airn of the H19 cluster, which allows the downstream enhancers to be activated and engage with the lgf2, expressing the lgf2 cluster.  For the maternal allele, the compound CTCF interacts with the ICR, allowing the Airn of H19 to be expressed (because methylation can't happen when CTCF is present).  The Airn expression stops the enhancers from binding to the lgf2 cluster, silencing it.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, there is hypermethylation at the ICR, which causes an over expression of the lgf2.  This hypermethylation occurs on the maternal allele, leading to lgf2 being expressed in both the paternal and maternal alleles.  This then causes a double dose of lgf2 being expressed.  lgf2 is a somatic cell growth-promoter, which, if over expressed, could contribute to tumor growth.  This hypermethylation is thought to possibly be an early event in tumor growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug currently manufactured in Japan that may be used to treat cancer.  Decitabine is a DNA demethylation agent, meaning that it removes methyl groups from the genome.  As was seen in the example of Wilm's tumor, hypermethylation can lead to somatic cell growth promotion, and the possible growth of tumors.  If demethylation agents like Decitabine are used, those methyl groups on the ICRs on the maternal allele could be removed, allowing the adhering of the CTCF insulator to the ICR, and silencing the lgf2 cluster.  The silencing of the cluster would then drop the levels of lgf2 back to the normal amount, restricting the continued growth of the tumor. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter the DNA methylation of the genome do not just alter the methylation for that individual cell, but for all the daughter cells the original will produce.  This is because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, meaning a cell will pass on to its daughter cells the same methylation pattern in its genome.  So once a drug alters the methylation, each subsequent mitotic division will result in an identical methylation pattern.  There are two times when the DNA methylation of the genome is reprogrammed, and these are called sensitive periods.  The sensitive periods are when the Primordial Germ Cells are being produced (egg and sperm) and when a fertilized zygote has yet to be implanted.  At these times all the DNA methylation is reset, meaning any changes made to the these cells would be erased before daughter cells were produced; completely negating any positive results.  As long as a drug that alters the DNA methylation was administered outside these two sensitive periods, the methylation changes would be passed onto future cell generations, allowing for more positive treatment results.</div>
