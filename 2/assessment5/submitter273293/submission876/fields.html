    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In healthy tissue, methylation of DNA at CPG islands is low
(hypomethylation) allowing genes such as tumor suppressors to fully express and
perform their function of controlling cell growth. In cancer,  CPG islands tend to be hypermethylated
possibly decreasing the expression of the tumor suppressor genes and
contributing a ‘hit’ towards developing cancer under the Knudson hypothesis.  These epimutations are mitotically heritable,
and rapidly selected (they may grow faster, or not die as rapidly). These conditions make cancer more likely. <br /></span></p>

<p><span>DNA at intergenic regions and repetitive elements in
healthy tissue tends to be highly methylated (hypermethylated) .  In cancerous cells, these regions and repetitive
elements become less methylated (hypomethylated)  which contributes to genomic instability events
such as transposition,  illegitimate recombination
between repeats, or activation of cryptic promoters that disrupt neighboring
genes. </span><span>These conditions make cancer more likely.</span><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, DNA methylation of the imprint control region blocks the binding of the CTCF protein. Without the CTCF protein, DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter (silencing it) which allows the downstream enhancers to access the Igf2.  Igf2 is expressed. In the maternal allele, CTCF is expressed (no methylation of the Imprint Control Region) and therefore the CTCF can insulate the Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. Igf2 is not expressed. <br /><div>Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome occurs when the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele caused by a mutation to cause loss of imprinting, two copies of the paternal chromosome being produced or on the rare occasion epigenetic disruption of imprinting.  This causes the loss of Cdkn1c (tumor suppressor)  expression which occurs at the same time that Igf2 (or others)  is over-expressed (by both parents). This will predispose a child to Wilm's (kidney) tumor. <br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor.  Decitabine may lead to  demehtylation of  promoters for tumor suppressor genes, allowing them to express and limit cell growth. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, meaning that it binds DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, and thus are replication dependent in order to reduce methylation. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, meaning that it is passed down to daughter cells when the original cell replicates. Therefore, when DNA methylation marks are changed by drugs or any other event, the new version of the epigenetic marks are passed on as  the cell continues to replicate. Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming that occur in early gestation before implantation and during germ cell development. Environmental conditions during these sensitive periods can affect the way the epigentic marks are reset and have life-long consequences for the individual, such as imprinting errors that could cause diseases or even death for the fetus. During germ cell development, the effects could be on the gametes, and affect the next generation, and even the generation after that. For these reasons, and the fact that these drugs are non-specific for the cell type affected, it would be inadvisable to treat an individual, or pregnant mother any time during these sensitive periods. <br /></div>
