    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands regulates gene expression during development and differentiation and one of the functions of DNA methylation is to maintain genetic stability. When transcription factor binding sites are mutated CpG islands are unable to maintain their unmethylated state and while the role of DNA methylation in cancer is context independent (on tumour type and stage of disease), in general  DNA methylation contributes to cancer through hypomethylation genome wide and through hypermethylation of tumour supressors.<br />One major role of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to repress the expression of harmful epigenetic elements<br />In cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to become hypomethylated resulting in misalignment.  This disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genome instability resulting in additional deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br /><div><br /></div><div>On the paternal allele when the imprint control region is methlyated CTCF can now no longer bind which means there is no insulator action and act on Igf2 and prmote expression from the paternal allele (we therefore have Igf2 expressed only on the paternal allele and not the maternal allele)  When the maternal allele is unmethylated CTCF binds its insulator
element, and it means that the enhancers will act on H19. But Igf2
will be silent for the maternal allele, so
we don't see expression. </div><div>With the loss of imprinting and hypermethylation of the imprint control region both in the paternal and maternal allele but the expression of Igf2 <br /></div>you have a double dose (compared to a normal cell) of Igf2- which is growth promoting and associated with Wilm's tumour.<br />Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster results in possible mutations or deletions within this region and the loss of imprinting resulting in too much Igf2. As Igf2 is an oncogene and promotes growth -and without Cdkn1cexpression to counterbalance the effects- can contribute to cancer</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNMTI inhibitors and is a hypomethylating agent which inhibits DNA Methyltransferase ensuring hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. This inhibition of DNA methylation (on non selective cancer cells) may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control cellular differentiation and proliferation.<br />Decitabine has good antineoplastic effect and by acting on  tumour cells may prevent further  tumour development.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation implies epigenetic changes which can be passed on during cell division to daughter/grandaughter cells and this process continues until they are actively erased. Given this, accounts needs to be taken of and sensitive period  when such treatment may not be appropriate i.e. when the altered environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup.  Such periods would include primordial germcell development through to production of mature eggs and sperm as well as pre implantation and early post implantation. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as these are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome and during this active reprogramming we have removal and then laying down of epgenetic marks in the genome with the potential of being passed on from generation to generation.<br /></div>
