    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell CpG island are hypomethylated while the other regions of the genome like the repetitive elements, the intergenic region and even in the introns of genes are hypermethylated. In contrast the cancer cell are viceversa the CpG islands are hypermethylated while the other regions (repetitive elements, the intergenic region and the introns of genes) are hypomethylated. The CpG islands are normally in the promotors of tumour suppressor genes and when methylated like in cancer cell they silence this genes and by being mytoticaly heritable can pass on the methylation all this leading to cancer. When there is hypomethylation in repeats and intergenic intervals there is genomic instability. This  leads to reciprocal translocations because of illegitamate recombinations between repeats due to the lack of methylation to prevent this. Also there is activation of repeats and transposition which can activate cryptic promoters or disruption in neighbouring genes. All this contributes to cancer due to this reciprocal translocation, insertions or deletions in the chromosomes. But the cancer is context dependant on if it is tumour suppressors or chromosomal instability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell the imprint control region is methylated in the patern allele which means the enhancers can act on Igf2 because there is no CTCF binding to the insulator so Igf2 is expressed. In the case of the maternal allele the imprint control region is unmethyalted which means CTCF will bind to the insulator and the enhancers will act on H19 and the Igf2 is silenced. In wilm's tumour there is hypermethylation on the maternal allele, so Igf2 is expressed. If Igf2 is both expressed in the paternal and maternal allele there is a doble dose of Igf2, which is growth promoting, and this leads to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor. What it does is hypomethylate the DNA. What happens is that they are nucloside analogues, after they incorporate to the DNA the DNMt binds and it can no longer be released (irriversible). They are division dependent which means that the cancer cells are more severely affected due to its rapid replications.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylations have a enduring effect because the epigenomics are mitiotically heritable. If it was a cancer cell, which replicates rapidly, they would pass on the alterations constantly. The sensitive periods are the moments where epigenetic reprogramming is being taken place. This moments are in the early embryonic development and the germ cell development. It is not advisable to treat patients during this periods because here the cell clears and resets all of its epigenetic marks. This means that if you were to administrate the drugs that de-methylate for example a enzyme that binds to the DNA it would never be methylated and there would be problems with the epigenetic marks which would bring genomic instability.</div>
