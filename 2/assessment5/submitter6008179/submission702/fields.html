    <div class="field-value">Ans 1.<br /><ul><li>DNA methylation at CpG islands(these CpG islands are mostly found in the promoter region of a gene) results in the silencing of  the expression of that particular gene.</li><li>Mostly these CpG islands are hypomethylated in normal cells but in cancerous cells, these CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated thus resulting in reduced expression of different useful genes like tumor suppressor genes, DNA repair genes etc which result in uncontrolled cell division leading to cancerous cell growth.</li><li>Increased  DNA methylation at CpG islands can result in one of the hits in Knudson Hypothesis leading to cancer, which is the result of multiple hits to DNA. This methylation can also occur in the tumour-suppressor genes resulting in uncontrolled cell division. This CpG island hypermethylation progresses with time leading to cancer finally. The hypermethylation of particular CpG islands varies by tumor type.e.g. RB in retinoblastoma, BRCA1 in breat cancer etc.</li><li>In the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements, the DNA is normally hypermethylated in order to silence the expression of certain transposon genes. These repeats and intergenic regions can disrupt the genomic integrity if these aren't silenced by DNA methylation.</li><li>DNA in the intergenic regions and the repetitve elements becomes hypomethylated in cancer resulting in their expression which leads to weakening of the genomic integrity.</li><li>Disruption of DNA methylation in the intergenic regions and the repetitve elements can contribute to cancer in many ways. The hypomethylation of the repetitive elemnts can result in the expression of different transposon genes which can jump throughout the genome even in between the tumor suppressor genes resulting in the disruption of those tumor suppressor protiens. These transposons can even jump in a promoter region of a proto-oncogene resulting in a more active promoter that makes it an oncogene. Different proto-oncogenes can be duplicated resulting in the increased cancerous cell division.<br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Ans 2.<br /><ul><li>In the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR of the cluster is methylated. This methylation spreads to the H19 promoter silencing it and also prevents the binding of CTCF(an insulator protein) to the ICR. As a result, the enhancers cause the Igf2 gene in the cluster to be expessed.</li><li>In maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated and the CTCF binds to it preventing the enhancers from causing the Igf2 gene to be expressed. Instead, these enhancers cause the expression of the H19 allele in this cluster.</li><li>In Wilm's Tumor, there is hypermethylation of the ICR in this cluster on both the maternal and paternal allele resulting in the Igf2 gene to be over-expressed while the H19 gene is under-expressed overall resulting in a disrupted function of H19 as well.<br /></li><li>In Wilm's Tumor, the Igf2 gene is over-expressed resulting in the overproduction of the Igf2 protein. This Igf2 gene being a growth promoting gene becomes an oncogene as it starts producing a large amount of growth factor which results in rapid and uncontrolled cell proliferation resulting in different childhood tumors like childhood kidney tumor.<br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Ans 3.<br /><ul><li>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors.</li><li>This drug acts on enzymatic epigenetic regulator e.g. DNMTs. This drug are replication dependent and cause the DNA demethylation by inhibiting the DNMT proteins irreversibly.</li><li>Decitabine acts as nucleoside analogues and irreversibly binds to the DNMTs after it is incorporated into the DNA, therefore is replication dependent. As the tumor cells divide quite often and rapidly, this drug proves quite effective against the tumor cells. But this drug is not specific to the tumor cells only due to its mechanism of action which is not quite clear till now. High dosage of this drug can be toxic and would not be efficient in DNA demethylation but only if administered in a specific low dosage, this drug can have a considerable anti-neoplastic effect and cause DNA demethylation without being toxic to the patient.<br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Ans 4.<br /><ul><li>DNA methylation is an epigenetic change that occurs to a specific or all locations of the genome. And these epigenetic changes can be passed on to the daughter and the granddaughter cells as such until they are actively erased at particular stages of life(Early embryonic development and Primordial germ cell development).</li><li>Sensitive period is the time when the epigenetic reprogramming of the genome is occurring i.e. when the epigenetic marks are being removed and re-established in the genome. During this time, the overall genome is quite susceptible to the epigenetic alterations.</li><li>There are 2 sensitive periods namely Early Embryonic Development Stage and the Primordial Cell Development Stage.</li><li>Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable as the drug can have lethal effects on the other cells of the body in addition to the tumor cells e.g. on the germ cells. As in the sensitive period, all the epigenetic marks are being reset, the drug can prevent many necessary epigenetic marks e.g. DNA methylation that have to be reset thus compromising the genomic stability leading to detrimental and even fatal side effects in the patient.<br /></li></ul></div>
