    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Gene promoters show a high
concentration of CpG islands and are normally unmethylated to allow gene
expression. In the case of cancer cells, these CpG islands turn into
hypermethylated regions that inactivate gene promoters and consequently silence
gene expression. Genes affected by hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer
cells act as tumour suppressors regulating cell cycle and DNA repair. Thus,
tumour suppressor genes become unregulated and cancer begins to develop.</p><p>Intergenic regions and
repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated and maintain genomic stability.
They become hypomethylated in cancer cells and cause translocations, deletions and
insertions that lead to chromosome instability and cancer development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In
a normal cell, H19 and ICR of the paternal Igf2/H19 cluster are methylated
allowing gene expression of Igf2; H19 and ICR of the maternal Igf2/H19 cluster are
unmethylated, consequently CTCF binds to ICR allowing H19 expression and
silencing Igf2 expression. </span></p><p><span>In Wilm’s tumour the maternal allele becomes methylated
in the same way as the paternal allele. Then, Igf2 gene is overexpressed. The
affected cell loses imprinting, the monoallelic expression of Igf2, a gene
involved in growth. Therefore, loss of imprinting promotes uncontrolled
cellular growth triggering cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor
(DNMTi) that interacts with DNA inhibiting DNA methyltransferases and leads to
a hypomethylated DNA. <br />As an epigenetic modifier, Decitabine effects are
mitotically hereditably from mother to daughter cells. Furthermore, Decitabine reaches
cancer cells because they replicate more than normal cells. It acts selectively
in dividing cells. Therefore, it may reactivate methylated tumour suppressor
genes in cancer cell lineage promoting apoptosis in these cells.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>One
cell displays the same DNA methylation pattern as its mother cell and daughter
cells thanks to cellular mitosis. Therefore, this epigenetic mark lasts over
time through following cell generations. <br />However, sensitive periods exist, such
as gametogenesis and pre-implantation of fertilized egg in younger people. Sensitive
periods occur when epigenetic marks are erased and reestablished. <br />Treating
patients with epigenetic drugs during these periods may lead to a compromised reprogramming
of DNA methylation. Potential embryo death or infertility may occur, as these
periods are critical for survival and correct development of embryo and germ
cells.</span></div>
