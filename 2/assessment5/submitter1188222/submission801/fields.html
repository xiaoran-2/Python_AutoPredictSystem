    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Usually, DNA is not methylated in CpG islands but it is in other regions of DNA in normal cells. This methylation helps to regulate the transcription or silencing some regions that are genetically advised to be like this. Cancer cells have mutations and sometimes mutations that deregulate this methylation process. Indeed, cancer cells have CpG islands methylated and other repetitive regions unmethylated, representing the opposite situation as normal cells do. This may cause silencing of tumor suppressor genes or upregulation of oncogenes, facts that trigger tumorigenesis. Usually, the intergenic and the repetitive elements are found in a methylated stage in cancer cells and this happens to silence tumor suppressor genes. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer cells, H19 region is methylated, being silenced in the maternal allele. This region usually the controls growth of cells. When the Igf2 region is methylated as well, it silences the paternal manifestation on growth and it happens in Will's tumor, where we have an uncontrolled growth (proliferation) mediated by this cluster of genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA-demethylated agents. This drug reduces the methylated levels of DNA, regions that might be silenced by some other mutation. This region should be downregulated and this might being cause problems to the patients, so this drug intends to take out this methyl groups in this regions so that the region can express correctly. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">If you take out an epigenetic mark, it will change the whole level of expression of that particular gene. Cancer cells have deregulation in their levels of methylation, acetylation and expression of that modified gene(s). If one can alter the methylation levels of DNA, depending on what region, it can bring some benefits in term of time and expression, because overexpression can be silenced by methylation and this happens in cancel cells all the time. DNA methylation is a very stable mark so it can be passed into the subsequent generations, reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during gametogenesis and after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells (sensitive period). If this methylation goes wrong, it will be passed onto the next generations and/or to the offspring in an undesirable way, so this treatment should be wisely used.  </div>
