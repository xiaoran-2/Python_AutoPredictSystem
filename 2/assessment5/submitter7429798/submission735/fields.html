    <div class="field-value">Normally, DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark by which DNA methyltransferases attach a methyl group to the cytosine ring of DNA.  At CpG islands serves to suppress gene expression as seen in X chromosome inactivation, imprinting, suppression of repetitive elements and formation of heterochromatin.   Otherwise, CpG islands may be unmethylated to allow gene expression. DNA methylation is cleared in early embryonic development and in promordial germ cells.   DNA methylation is regulated by ND methyl transferases  Histone methylation may also influence DNA methylation.  <br />In cancer, CpG islands become hypermethylated and hence suppress gene expression, especially the tumour suppressor genes.  The specific islands that become hypermethylated will vary the type of tumour formed.  The methylation progresses with time and with advancing age. Hypermethylation may apply to a single gene.  It may also apply to a set of genes referred to as a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) such as in colorectal cancer.  Further, CpG island shores (kilobases either side of the islands) may be affected.<br /> At imprint control regions hypomethylation may reduce growth restriction factors and hypermethylation may cause overexpression of growth promoting genes.  For example,hypermethylation may cause excessive expression of Igf2 as in Wilm's tumour.<br />Hypomethylation at repeats and intergenic intervals may lead to genomic instability causing incorrect recombinations between the repeats, activation of repeats, changes to adjacent genes and causing abnormal karyotypes.  For example, deletions eg. 5q- syndrome in myelodysplasia; translocations eg Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukaemia or in inserted genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 imprint control region is located on chromosome 15 and may be explained by the Insulator Model.  Methylation of the paternal allele prevents the binding of the transcriptional repressor CTCF at the imprint control region so that Igf2 is not protected from its downstream enhancers.  Hence, Igf2 is promoted and growth ensues. <br />Hypomethylation at the maternal allele allows binding of the CTCF at the imprint control region so that Igf2 is insulated from its enhancers. This enables expression of H19 which reduces growth. <br />These differentially methylated regions are established in the germ line by de novo methyl transferases and maintained throughout development.<br />Wilm's tumours result from increased methylation of H19 so that it is silenced, and from loss of methylation at Igf2 so that it is activated. <br />Disruption at the h19/Igf2 cluster, more typically later in life, contributes to cancer via overexpression of paternal Igf2 (growth) and under-expression of maternal H19 and its growth constraint. (Akin to Genetic Conflict theory in which the male strives to produce strong offspring but this is counteracted by a maternal drive to restrict growth.)<br />Overexpression of H19 contributes to oesophageal and colorectal tumours, down regulation of H19 to breast and lung cancers.<br />  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is sold as Dacogen, marketed by a Japanese company called Eisai and belongs to a new class of drugs which act as DNA demethylating agents.  Decitabine is an analogue of cytidine, a nucleotide in DNA and RNA.  It is incorporated into DNA during replication and into RNA during transcription.  It switches off the protein DNA methyltransferase and induces DNA hypomethylation to 'undo' the pathological hypermethylation.  Hence the genome is unsilenced and 'unravelled' to allow normal access for cellular machinery. This than enables restoration of normal gene expression and restoration of tumour suppressor gene function so that tumour formation is reduced / discontinued.  This then allows for normal differentiation and proliferation of the myeloid series in myelodysplasia and prevention of myelodysplasia to acute leukaemia.  The more specific effect of epigenetic targeted drugs plans to reduce the wide range of side effects from more traditional chemotherapy. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can affect the epigenome by silencing via attachment of methyl groups to histones.  The epigenome can have enduring effects as it is mitotically heritable and may be passed onto daughter and granddaughter cells, unless they are cleared.  <br />A sensitive period is that within which epigenetic control is most likely to be vulnerable to damage by envinonmental influences; such as maternal care, diet and toxins.  Especially sensitive periods are during early development and germ cell development when epigenetic marks are being established, rather than being purely maintained. Evidence for this comes from artificial reproductive technolgies and epidemiological studies. The Dutch famine ine during the peri-conceptual period led to increased mental and altered glucose metabolism diseases in the offspring.  The Overkalix studies showed correlation between increased grandparental food supply and reduced grandchild longevity.  This is supported by the Bristol area study which showed a plentiful food supply in mid childhood led to a fourfold increase of diabetes in the grandchildren.  <br />Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable as this may induce irreversible damage to the genome and epigenome which may then be passed down through generations.</div>
