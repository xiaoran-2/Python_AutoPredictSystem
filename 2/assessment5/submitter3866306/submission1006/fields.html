    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation occurs at the cytosine bases of eukaryotic DNA, which are converted to 5-methylcytosine by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes. The altered cytosine residues are usually immediately adjacent to a guanine nucleotide, resulting in two methylated cytosine residues sitting diagonally to each other on opposing DNA strands.This forms what is known as a CpG dinucleotide- an important regulatory gene regulatory element. <br />Studies have shown that genes with a promoter region that contains a high concentration of 5-methylcytosine are transcriptionally silent.Aberrant methylation of DNA has been associated with an increased rate of malignancy. DNA hypermethylation is linked to the activation of genes and DNA hypomethylation has been associated with the development of cancer through various mechanisms.<br /> As compared with normal cells, the malignant cells                     show major disruptions in their DNA methylation patterns. Hypomethylation usually involves repeated DNA sequences, such as long interspersed nuclear elements, whereas hypermethylation                     involves CpG islands.Although certain genes such as <i>RASSF1A</i> and <i>p16</i> are commonly methylated in a variety of cancers, other genes are methylated in specific cancers. One example is the <i>GSTP1</i> gene, which is hypermethylated in more than 90% of prostate cancers but is largely unmethylated in acute myeloid leukemia.<br />Long interspersed nuclear elements are the most plentiful mobile DNAs or retrotransposons in the human genome. Hypomethylation                        of these mobile DNAs causes transcriptional activation and has been found in many types of cancer, such as urinary bladder                        cancer. Hypomethylation of the mobile DNA can also cause disruption of expression of the adjacent gene as well. The L1 mutational                        insertions have been found to disrupt the <i>APC</i> gene and the <i>CMYC</i> gene in colon and breast cancers, respectively</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
