    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>In normel cells CpG islands are maintained in a balanced methylated state, there are islands of CpG repeated code that is immune to regular methylation and remain active even when the gene isn't being transcribed in a determined moment.</li><li>There is hypermethylation of these CpG islands with silencing of gene expression.</li><li>I would believe the silencing of genes aimed at programmed cellular death from the lack of regulation of CpG islands is the disease mechanism.</li><li>Gene methylation is higher is genes that are highly used which scientists theorize acts as a gene replication regulator with silencing from neighboring high usage genes, inhibit antisense transcription or RNA splicing. Differemt subcellular types of the same progenitor stem cell have slightly different DNA methylation regions which could be the cause of different synthetized proteins and different actions of different cells such as blood cells. H4K20me3 and H4K16ac in heterochromatin can be silenced in cancerous cells. <span>H3K27me3 which is present in stem cells but is supposed to be silent in daughter differenciated cells remains active in cancerous cells which have the capacity of acting like a mother cell with the potential to produce other lines of cells and escape programmed cell death.</span></li><li>Lack of regular DNA methylation silencing in cancerous cells can create daughter cells such as in the case of leukemia that secrete abnormal proteins (such as many solid cancers with VEGF factor), lack of regulated mitosis and loss of programmed cell death. lincRNA-p21 interacts with p53 which binds to DNA-polymerase II to revise proper transcription. Mechanisms that inactivate p53 is associated with several kinds of cancer.</li></ol></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>Silences paternal lncRNA Kcnq1ot1by interacting with the Kcnq1 locus in the placenta but isn't present in the fetal liver and other organs of the fetus.</li><li>Causes silencing of <span>Igf2r/Slc22a2/Slc22a3 with reduction of activity by targetting the H3K9 histone methyltransferase. Mostly inactive in the growing fetus.</span></li><li>There is a sustained active status of the maternal side by loss of imprinting with an excessive proliferation of IGF2 in the growing fetus causing cellular proliferation. There is a reduction  of H19 activity in both paternal and maternal side.</li><li>Loss of imprinting by maintaining the maternal IGF2 active stimulates overproliferation of specific kinds of cells especially embryonal tumors.</li></ol></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>It works as a <span>DNA-demethylating agent which causes a reduction in gene transcription.</span></li><li><span>Methylation will be blocked by this drug.</span></li><li>The drug not only causes a reduction in protein transcription needed for the canerous cell to live and multiply but the changes in epigenetic marks is passed down to all of it's daughter cells causing a reduction in mitosis or at least an increased susceptibility to standard chemotherapy.</li></ol></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>The advantage of this therapy is that you are not killing a current batch of cells in mitosis like normal chemotherapy but you are doing a silencing of protein synthesis inside of the genetic code itself which has the advantage that all daughter cells will express the same epigenetic change making it difficult for canercous cells to multiply.</li><li>There are 4 steps in mitosis with sensitive periods of DNA-polymerase II translating copies of DNA. There are also periods of mitosis where cell division can be paused thanks to p53 to repair translation errors and other protection factors in case mitosis isn't needed. If you alter these periods you can reduce the amount of cells dividing.</li><li>Another important sensitive period is during embriogenesis where organs are being developed which are sensitive to teratogens causing often serious malformations that might be incompatible with life.</li><li>A high risk group would be pregnant women where an embryo is especially sensitive to dangerous toxic drugs. Studies with the safety of epigenetic methylating agents haven't been researched so we don't know if these drugs could cause serious harm to a baby.</li></ol></div>
