    <h1>Submission 779 from Anon (session_user_id: d7c92116740957008a4a0b0d39e6129696984bf4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation have lasting effects beyond the period of treatment because the new epigenetic state is inherited through cellular mitotic division, a process highly active in tumors. Hence, altering the epigenome changes how the genome is transcribed not only at the target cells, but also at its progeny.<br />There are periods when altering the epigenome can be deleterious to the individual or his/her offspring as these changes are heritable. Chiefly, these periods are the embrionic development  (through mitosis) and the germ cell formation (through miosis).<br />Treatment during sensitive periods is not recommended because of the unknown untoward effects that could arise due to epigenomic alterations (since they have different effects on different cell types/tissues) that could affect the patient or the epigenetic imprinting, which could even affect different generations of individuals.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation of CpG islands silences genes that are downstream in the genome. Usually, CpG islands are hypomethylated, instead, we find that most of the genome methylation is located at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, acting as a protection for genetic inestability such as insertions, transpositions, activation of cryptic promoters, disruption to neighbouring genes, illegitimate recombination between repeats,activation of repeats  or chromosomal translocations, which are facilitated by these genetic elements. But in cancer, we observe that, globally, methylation is decreased and its pattern is altered, methylation at CpG islands and shores is increased, therefore, silencing genes that may check tumor growth. But methylation decreases at CpG poor promoters, intergenic regions and repetitive elements, thus favoring mutations, gene overexpression, oncogen activation, genetic inestability, and therefore, the development of cancer. <br />It is worth mentioning that, when considering the use of drugs that alter the epigenomic state, the role of DNA methylation depends on tumor type and stage of disease.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprinting control region is hypermethylated, therefore, the Igf2 gene is expressed and the growth factor is produced. Whereas in the maternal allele, the ICR is hypomethylated and the Igf2 is silenced.<br />In Willm's tumor, both alleles present the paternal state and the Igf2 is overexpressed, therefore promoting tumor growth. Thus, altertion of imprinting can contribute to cancer development by altering gene transcription.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that acts by irreversibly inhibiting DNA-methyltranferases after it has been incorporated into the DNA strand, and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. Its chief function is to arrest tumor growth by decreasing the levels of DNA methylation, specifically in tumors such as MDS, in which supressor genes are silenced.</div>
