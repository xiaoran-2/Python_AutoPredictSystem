    <div class="field-value">---CpG islands clustered near gene promoters are usually unmethylated <br />---so transcription factors can attach to promoters to allow DNA transcription and gene expression<br />---in cancer the CpG islands near promoters of tumor suppressor genes  are heavily methylated <br />-----primary mechanism<br />-----methylated CpG islands lead to repressive chromatin structure that prohibits transcription<br />-----meCpG can be bound by methylated CpG binding proteins e.g. MeCP1 &amp; 2 <br />----these binding proteins have a DNA binding domain and transcriptional repression domain<br />-----meCP proteins recruit other proteins that condense chromatin <br />----secondary mechanism<br />-----transcription factors can't bind to promoter because of meCP binding proteins so gene is not expressed, no protein made<br /><br />----- this tumor suppressor gene will not be active to stop  uncontrolled cell replication<br />-----cancer results<br /><br />----normally DNA in intergenic regions and at repetitive elements is heavily methylated<br />----this silences cryptic intergenic  promoters  <br />----Repetitive elements such as IAP (intercisturnal A particles) contain strong promoters in their LTRs ( long terminal repeats)<br />----LTRs contain both sense and anti-sense promoters<br />-----intergenic and IAP promoters normally silenced <br /><br />----in cancer intergenic cryptic promoters  and IAP promoters are  hypomethylated and become active so can bind transcription factors and lead to gene expression,upregulation of oncogene,  that leads to cancer  <br /><br />---hypomethylation of repeats intergenic regions leads to genomic instability which can lead to cancer<br />----illegitimate recombination between repeats say two similar repeats on two different chromosomes<br />---- translocation between two different chromosomes<br />-----activation of repeats which can jump to different location and then activate some other oncogene<br />---activation through hypomethylaton of crypyic promoter causes disruptionn to neighbouring gene<br />----insertions,deletions due to hypomethylation<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">--paternal allele ,DNA at  ICR(imprinting control region) is methylated <br />----this methylation blocks binding of protein CTCF to this ICR<br />--- ,DNA methylation spreads from ICR to H19 promoter to silence H19<br />----enhancers will not bind to H19 <br />----no CTCF to insulate Igf2 from enhancers<br />-----enhancers paternally can activate Igf2 promoting growth <br /><br />maternal allele, no methylation at ICR <br />---insulating protein CTCF will bind to uninsulated ICR<br />----CTCF will block enhancers from reaching Igf2 and activating it<br />----promoter of H19 will not be methylated maternally<br />----H19 activated and binds enhancers which will not reach Igf2<br /><br />in Wilm's tumor, maternal methylation  pattern is absent<br />---paternal imprinting pattern is the only one present in both alleles<br />----mutation/deletion to cause loss of maternal pattern<br />----paternal uniparental disomy,2 copies of parental chromosome <br />---epigenetic disruption for loss of imprinting (rare)<br /><br />----imprinted disorder, resulting from various disorders in linked Kcnq1 and H19/Igf2 clusters at 11q15.5<br />---loss of Cdkn1c (tumor suppressor, growth suppressor)<br />upregulation of Igf2 (oncogene,growth factor) leads to too much uncontrolled cell division which leads to cancer<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">---decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMT1)<br />----the methyl group will be removed from cytosine after replication<br />---upon replication the epigenetic marks, that is DNA  methylation will be lost<br /><br />----this drug at low dose is cytosine  analog <br />---incorporated into DNA<br />-----when DNMT1 comes along it is irreversibly  bound to this analog<br />--replication dependent drug<br />----cancer cells replicate at high rate so they attract the DNMT1 a lot<br />---reduced methylation of cytosines after treatment<br />-----hypomethylation  of CpG islands near tumor suppressor gene promoters so they are now expressed <br />---before treatment these tumor suppressor genes were unexpressed<br />----this will now stop cancer cell replication<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable by the action of specific enzymes like DNMT1. This enzyme methylates the hemi-methylated daughter cells by adding a methyl group to the unmethylated cytosine in the daughter cell. <br /><br />This process of methylation is repeated for the next cell division and so on.<br /><br />----it will maintain its methylated state throughout all cell divisions for potentially the life of the organism<br />-----If the methylation is either added or removed this same state will be maintained through further mitosis <br /><br /><br />----a sensitive period happens when epigenetic marks are established rather than maintained.There is also removal of previous marks<br /><br />sensitive periods are:<br /><br />----removal of marks in primordial germ cells mid-gestation<br />------formation of sperm and egg<br />-------removal of marks in embryo pre-implantation<br />------setting new marks in blastocyst to create create cell differentiation<br />------, short period post natally when brain cells can be epigenetically influenced by environment such as maternal care and diet<br />------during gestation as in agouti mice diet and chemicals can influence level of methylation for rest of life<br /><br />-----methylation of intergenic regions and repeats are necessary for genomic stability <br />-----------treatment by a drug that causes demethylation during this period of methylation would lead to genomic instability and possibly cancer.<br /><br /></div>
