    <div class="field-value">In normal human cells, the majority of CpGs are methylated. Usually the CpGs are unmethylated if the genes are expressed.  Methylation of CpG sites in the promoter of a gene inhibits gene expression. The "normal" CpG methylation profile is often inverted in cells that become tumorigenic.[1] Methylation of CpG sites within the promoters of genes can lead to their silencing. This feature is found in a number of human cancers. An example of this is the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. The hypomethylation of CpG sites leads to the over-expression of oncogenes within cancer cells.[2][3]<br /><br />Intergenic regions normally comprise the majority of a cell's DNA. Most of non-coding regions have no currently known function.  In cancer global hypomethylation of repeat-rich intergenic regions occurs. Consequently, transposable elements may become active and contribute to the genomic instability observed in cancer cells.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In humans, the IGF2 gene is located on chromosome 11p15.5. This region contains a lot of imprinted genes.  Igf2 is imprinted maternally, with expression resulting favourably from the paternally inherited allele. The protein CTCF is is necessary when repressing expression of the gene, as it binds to the H19 imprinting control region (ICR). Maternal allele has an insulator between the IGF2 promoter and enhancer. In paternal allele the insulator has been methylated. [1]

The major role of IGF-2 is as a growth promoting hormone during gestation. Loss of imprinting of IGF2 is a common feature in tumours seen in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. 

 Wilms tumor, or nephroblastoma is cancer of the kidneys which typically occurs in children, rarely in adults. The WT1 gene on chromosome 11p encodes Wilms tumor protein. Inactivation of WT1 causes Wilm's tumour. The WT1 protein binds among other factors p53 which is tumor suppressor.[2]

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It gas been used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.to remove methyl groups from DNA. This may weaken the effects of gene silencing mechanisms that occurred prior to the methylation. Demethylation may reduce the stability of silencing signals and thus confer relative gene activation. 

There are two mechanisms which are thought to be involved in its action. The first, as I mentioned, is inhibition of DNA methyltransferase causing hypomethylation of DNA. The second is direct cytotoxicity in abnormal cells in the bone marrow through incorporation into DNA, resulting in cell death.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome. DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent cell generations. Sensitive periods are the periods when the environment may be able to influence epigenetic make-ups, as the active remodelling of the epigenome is going on. The first period begins with the primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperm. The second sensitive period is the pre-implantation period and the early post-implantation period. During these periods removal and then laying down of epigenetic  marks at different places in the genome takes place. During the periods  of germ cell development and early embryonic development any treatment with drugs which can potentially influence epigenome is highly inadvisable, as DNA methylation may be distorted and this will lead to over or under expression of some genes.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
