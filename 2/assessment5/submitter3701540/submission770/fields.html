    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">CpG island is usually unmethylated. Methylation at CpG island occurs to silence the gene expression. Inactive X-chromosome also shows DNA methylation at CpG island. In Cancer, the CpG island is hypermethylated. This hypermethylation leads to the silencing of the tumor suppressor genes checks DNA damage suppressing the tumor formation. <br />DNA methylation in the intergenic regions and repititive elements also have a role to play in cancer. Usually these places are methylated to maintin genomic integrity. It helps in silencing of repeats to prevent transposition and also to avoid transcriptional interference. In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated leading to genomic instability. This can lead to activation of transposons which can lead to activation or silencing of unnecessary gene . This can also lead to deletion, insertion or reciprocal translocation which ultimately leads to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer. The H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. Thus it is paternally imprinted.When there is loss of imprinting both the alleles behave like paternal allele i.e the Cdkn1c and Igf2. So if there is no Cdkn1c expression and up regulation if Igf2, then it is promoting growth in overall. Thus they display both fetal and post natal overgrowth. and it is related to the expression of these two genes. Thus it has predisposed to childhood tumors but not to adult tumor and thus the Wilm's tumor occur. The DNA methylation found in imprint region can spread downstream into the H19 promoter and thus is silenced contributing to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNMTi or DNA methyl transferase inhibitors family. It is a nucleoside analogue which irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated in the DNA and is therefore replication dependent. Since cancer cells have high replication rate it has a good anti-tumor effect. It has an anti-neoplastic effect when given at low and adequate dose.It is used in the treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndromes which are precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have enduring effects on epigenome as there are certain periods where epigenome is readily susceptible to changes and also these changes are heritable and are called transgenerational epigenetics. These are the sensitive period when environment may be able to influence genetic and epigenetic makeup. These sensitive periods are from the primordial germ cell to production of mature egg and sperm. They include the early embryonic development and germ cell development. Treating patients during sensitive period would be inadvisable as these changes can be acquired throughout lifetime and any damage can prove to be fatal.</div>
