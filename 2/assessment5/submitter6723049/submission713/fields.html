    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is the silencing of gene expression. However, in cancer DNA methylation is disrupted because the CpG islands are hypermethylated. This contributes to cancer because hypermethylation at the CpG islands leads to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, the role of DNA methylation if to maintain genome stability. In cancer, this DNA methylation is disrupted because in cancer cells there is hypomethylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Here, hypomethylation promotes genome instability (e.g. repeat activation or transposition activation).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of the imprinting control region (ICR) on the paternal allele prevents binding of CTCF. Thus, DNA methylation can spread to the H19 promoter and silence the gene. Furthermore, the enhancers can access the Igf2, which results in Igf2 expression. The ICR is not methylated on the maternal allele. Therefore, CTCF can bind to the ICR and prevent the enhancers from accessing the Igf2, which results in no expression of Igf2. Usually, there is a normal dose of the H19 from the maternal strand and the Igf2 from the paternal strand. But, in Wilm's tumour the ICR is hypermethylated, and indicate that both strands are derived from the father (paternal origin) and thus have such an expression. This leads to an overexpression of Igf2 (and no H19), which leads to tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA
methyltransferase inhibitors. They have an impact on DNA methylation as they inhibit DNA methylation (in other words: they trigger demethylation). Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect as it recovers expression of silenced tumour suppressor genes, because  of demethylation of CpG islands in these genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Therefore, epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter cells and even granddaughter cells. So, the effects can last beyond the period of the drug treatment. A sensitive period is a period when epigenetic marks are reprogrammed. Two sensitive periods of development can be identified: germ cell development and early embryonic development. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because epigenetic marks are being reprogrammed during these periods and there are more noticable effects on the genome that are caused by the prevention of DNA methylation.</p></div>
