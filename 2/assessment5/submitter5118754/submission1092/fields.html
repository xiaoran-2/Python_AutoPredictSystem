    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">About 60% of CpG-dinucleotides are methylated in mammals. Unmethylated CpG-dinucleotides are grouped into "CpG-islands" that are present in 5 'regulatory regions of many genes. DNA methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions of genes leads to cancer through hypermethylation, which is stable transcriptional repressing of the <br /><div>tumour suppressor genes. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements contain functionally important elements such as promoters and enhancers or noncoding RNAs. In cancer global DNA is hypomethylated and the reduction of the methylation in Intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to genome instability. <br /></div><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation pattern of the paternal allele includes imprinting control region (ICR) which is normally methylated and the methylation coverages also promotor region of H19 gene and inactivates this gene, due to         Igf2 expression allowed. In the maternal allele ICR
 is normally unmethylated. The transcription factor CTCF plays a heavy role in repressing the If2 gene, by binding to the H19 ICR. In cancer hypermethylation of ICR results in Igf2 overexpression in Wilm’s tumour and inactivation of H19.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) is a 
nucleoside analogue that inhibits DNMT methyltransferase. <span><span><span>The
 mechanism of drug action based on the covalent binding of the enzyme in
 complex with DNA, thus making it impossible to fulfill its function and
 the enzyme degrades methyltransferase. However,
 in order to decitabine was active, it must integrate into the genome of
 the cell. </span></span>In
 the case where the inactivation was determined by methylation of the 
promoter region of the gene, experiments were performed to resume 
expression by inhibiting DNMT.</span><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can altering the level of the gene expression or gene regulation through transcription factors. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division and are passively erased or can are actively erased by disigned drags. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
