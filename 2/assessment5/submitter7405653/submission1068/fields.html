    <h1>Submission 1068 from Anon (session_user_id: 9d00ade24d271f5ac1aca431ab640dffe04a45ca)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The specific class that of epigenetic inhibitors that Deciabine (Dacogen)  belongs to is DNA MethylTransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). The EZH2 gene encodes an enzyme, Histone-lysine N-MethylTransferase EZH2 which acts as a gene silencer by the addition of three methyl groups to Lysine 27 of Histone 3 (H3K27) which in turn induces chromatin condensation. The microRNA miR-101 inhibits the translation of the messenger RNA for encoding EZH2. Loss of this microRNA gene leads to over expression of EZH2 and leads to an increase in histone methylation which then silences the expression of the tumor suppressor gene. The cancer MyeloDysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is a direct consequence of this. The impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation is to reduce the amount of histone methylation, thus (at least partially) restoring the expression of the tumor suppressor gene.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dr Stephen Baylin speculation that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumor cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy" could be explained by that fact the alteration to the epigenetic marks in the genome are mitotically heritable and the fact the epigenetic fixes that were done could leave the tumor cells more susceptible to lower doses of chemotherapy. Mitotically heritablemeans that DNA methylation is passed on to succeeding cell generations. The sensitive periods during embryonic development is during the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks, from fertilized egg to just before implantation and during the generation of primordial germ cells (PGCs).  The sensitivity to PGCs extends up  to adolescence. Treating patients during sensitive periods would disrupt the resetting/establishment of the epigenetic marks and may cause disruptions that may lead to future DNA stabilities.<br /><br />NOTE: For all questions, I have searched the web and used some definitions, explanations and clarifications from Wikipedia. All other sources were the class viewgraphs and the recommended reading material.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations in the DNA methylation at the Imprint Control Regions (ICRs) may result in the loss of expression of growth suppression genes and over expression of growth stimulation genes. An example is the hyper-methylation of the ICR in the H19 cluster and consequence over expression of Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2 ) cluster. In the normal cell, the paternal allele has the H19 cluster methylated so that the enhancers act on the lgf2 cluster so expression occurs, while the maternal allele has the H19 cluster unmethylated so the enhancer are inhibited from acted on the lgf2 cluster. In this way, the cell gets only the expression of the lgf2 gene from the paternal allele (a normal dose of lgf2). In the cancerous cell, the paternal allele stays the same, but the maternal allele now has the H19 cluster methylated as well, just like the paternal allele. Now the enhancers on the maternal allele act on the lgf2 cluster and the cell gets a double dose of lgf2 expression. This over expression of growth promoting gene lgf2 results in leads to Wilm's tumor (nephroblastoma), a kidney cancer that typically occurs only in childhood.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-value">Aberrations in epigenetic controls seen in cancer can be due to changes in the DNA methylation. This may be in the form of locus specific DNA hyper-methylation or genome-wide DNA hypo-methylation. For DNA hyper-methylation, the changes can be found in CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressing genes or in Imprint Control Regions (ICRs) with an resultant loss of imprinting. In the normal cell, the CpG islands preceding promoters are generally unmethylated while the repetitive elements (REs), intergenic regions (IGRs) are methylated. In the cancerous cell, the methylation is reversed with the CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor promoters heavily methylated while while the REs and IGRs are unmethylated. The unmethylated CpG islands allow tumor suppression genes to be activated. Consequently, the methylation of CpG islands with the resultant spread to the 2 kilobase distal CpG island shores will inhibit the tumor suppression genes and thus promote cancerous growth. In the normal cell, the DNA methylation of REs and IGRs serves to prevent DNA instability. This silencing of repeats prevents transposition, mutation of repeats (meC to T) to avoid transposition, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and prevent illegitimate recombination. In cancerous cells, this instability can cause gene insertions, deletions, and reciprocal translocations. Evidence for hypo-methylation at REs and IGRs and the resultant instability is that deletion of DNA (cytosine-5-)-MethylTransferase 1 (DNMT1) in mice leads to a non viable embryo while mutations in human DNMT3B results in the Immunodeficiency, Centromere instability and Facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome. A number of cancers are also the result.<br /></div>
