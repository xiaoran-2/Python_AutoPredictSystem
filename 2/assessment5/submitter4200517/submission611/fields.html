    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are found at promoters of genes and are normally unmethylated and active. This is important because CpG islands are usually found where transcription factors bind, and if they are not methylated, transcription and then expression of that gene to occur. In cancer, CpG islands become increasingly methylated (hypermethylated), and this causes silencing of the genes. For example, these genes might be tumour suppressing genes. If tumour suppressing genes are silenced (inactive), then this allows the tumour to grow. Intragenic regions and repetitive elements of DNA are normally methylated (silenced) to maintain genomic stability or integrity. This is disrupted or changed in cancer, where it is found that these intragenic regions and/or repetitive elements become demethylated. Lack of methylation in these regions/elements allows activation for areas that should normally be silenced and causes instability in the genome. This contributes to cancer as these regions can stop or change translation of a gene either by interfering with RNA transferase; or by causing elements to "jump" around the genome, which can result in insertions, duplications, translocations, or deletions of parts or whole genes. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting is when expression of a gene is determined by the parent of origin, and this expression is controlled at Imprint Control Regions (ICRs). The H19/lgf2 cluster is an example of an enhance/insulator blocking mechanism of imprinted gene control. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, so it is not bound by CTCF (the insulator protein). Methylation of the ICR spreads to H19 (the non-coding RNA), silencing H19. Because Igf2 is not insulated by CTCF, then the enhancers activate Igf2 expression. On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, but it is bound by the insulator protein (CTCF). In this case, CTCF insulates Igf2 from the enhancers,and so the enhancers (loop) act on expression of H19. Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm's tumour when hypermethylation occurs to the maternal allele. When this happens, CTCF does not bind to the maternal ICR, the enhancers do not act on H19, but instead act on the maternal Igf2 allele. Igf2 is a growth promoter. Loss of normal imprinting early on causes a double dose of Igf2 expression in children and leads to embryonic/childhood tumours (Wilm's tumours), which are found in the kidneys.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that is used to treat cancer. It belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA-demethylating agents. If DNA is hypermethylated, it can silence tumour-suppressing genes, which normally suppress the growth of tumours. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation by binding DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). The DNMTs are incorporated into the DNA, and are irreversibly bound to Decitabine. The DNMTs cannot be released,  DNMT1 normally binds to the unmethylated (hemimethylated) strand of DNA during cell replication, so when DNMT1 is inactive, methylation will be diluted out. Cancer cells replicate more rapidly, and so loss of methylation occurs more rapidly. As a result, the tumour-suppresser genes are reactivated, helping to keep the tumour in check. Long-term effect of the use of Decitabine is not yet known, since all cells divide at some point. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation or demethylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. So if epigenetic drugs cause hypomethylation, this will be passed on to the daughter cells during replication (mitosis). If the epigenetic drugs are causing demethylation, then during cell division the methylation will be erased and will not return. Sensitive periods are those times during which there is reprogramming (erasing and resetting of epigenetic marks). These sensitive times occur during early embryonic development (pre-implantation of the embryo), and also during development of the germ cells (gametes). Treating patients at this time would not be advisable because changing the environment of the cells could lead to failure of normal epigenetic reprogramming. This can result in disorders such as expression of two maternal or paternal alleles (imprinting disorders) mutations, duplications, deletions, insertions, translocations, or deletions. </div>
