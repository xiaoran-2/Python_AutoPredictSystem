    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation of the C5 of the cytosine base in cytosine-P-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides is one of the main epigenetic marks employed by the body in the control of gene expression. Clusters of CpG dinucleotides form CpG islands and these are often found at gene promoters, usually in an unmethylated (active) state, with methylation of a CpG island leading to gene silencing. The intergenic region and repetitive elements associated with a certain (unmethylated) CpG island and gene are usually methylated, which is important in maintaining genomic stability; methylation of intergenic regions is thought to prevent deletions, insertions, duplications and reciprocal translocations of chromosomes, and also silences cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites, whereas methylation at repetitive elements, silences genetic repeats, preventing illegitimate recombination and transposition and also prevents interference in transcription by silencing other strong promoters.<br /><br />However, in cancer cells where aberrant epigenetic control is observed, DNA methylation doesn't occur in the same way as in wild type cells. Where CpG islands are normally unmethylated, in cancer cells, they are hypermethylated, as well as the CpG island shores. Hypermethylation of these areas very often leads to genetic silencing of genes, such as tumour suppressor genes, enabling tumour growth. In cancer cells, the intergenic region, repetitive elements and the gene itself exist unmethylated and are unable to protect the genome from other strong promoters and illegitimate recombinations, amongst other issues. In cancer cells, hypomethylation of DNA repeats and CpG poor promoters also occur. Lack of methylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions means no shielding between DNA repeat sequences allowing for reciprocal chromosome translocations and activation of cryptic sites. The lack of methylation at CpG poor promoters, although less common, leads to easy activation of genes, and in the case of cancerous cells, oncogenes.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Monoallelic gene expression is due to parent-of-origin specific imprinting; one allele of a gene is silenced. The expression of these genes is controlled by ICRs, which have various mechanisms to implement imprinted gene expression depending on gene locus, with the ICR of the imprinted allele associated with DNA methylation establishment during the primordial germ cell development.<br /><br />In the case of H19/Igf2, the maternal allele of Igf2 is silent due to blocking of the unmethylated ICR by insulator protein CTCF, leaving downstream enhancers free to enhance expression of lncRNA H19. However, on the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and unbound by CTCF, allowing the enhancers to promote the expression of Igf2. As CTCF is not bound to the paternal ICR, methylation spreads to the nearby H19 promoter, thus silencing the gene, and enhancers are free to access Igf2. <br /><br />The disrupted H19/Igf2 cluster observed in Wilm's tumour is caused by hypermethylation of the maternal ICR and thus an overexpression of Igf2, in addition to the normal expression from the paternal allele. Loss of imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer as Igf2 is a growth promoting oncogene where increased expression leads to loss of Cdkn1c, a growth suppressing tumour suppressor.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As a DNA-demethylating agent, Decitabine is likely involved in active demethylation of hypermethylated regions e.g.  CpG islands and CpG island shores, that lead to aberrant epigenetic control, gene expression and tumour growth. Removal of the methyl group occurs through conversion to various intermediates; enzymes can catalyse the removal of the methyl group, as breaking the covalent methyl-C5 C-C bond in methylated-cytosine's original state is very difficult. This method primarily utilises TET proteins and also AID deaminase.<br /><br />Epimutations, e.g. hypermethylation, occur frequently in cancer growth, potentially as they are rapidly selected and mitotically heritable. However, they are reversible, unlike DNA mutations, so demethylation of CpG islands and thus gene silencing resulting from Decitabine may prevent binding of factors involved in transcription e.g. HDACs, leading to depletion of overexpressed growth promoting genes e.g. Igf2 in Beckwith Wiedermann syndrome and reinstatement of expression of tumour suppressor genes e.g. BRCA1 in breast cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering patterns of DNA methylation leads to changes in the genes expressed, to what extent and where they will be expressed e.g. changes in CpG island methylation of gene promoters, and thus changes to the formation of bodily tissues and functions. This can further affect the epigenome if for example, certain proteins required for a particular function were silenced e.g. DNMT1, passive DNA methylation in the tissue couldn't be maintained.<br /><br />Sensitive periods are periods of time in which previous epigenetic marks are cleared (epigenetic reprogramming) and the genome is susceptible to epigenetic changes. Epigenetic changes can be caused by the environment e.g. exposure to toxins/carcinogens (passive tobacco smoke). There are two main time periods where epigenetic reprogramming occurs; during embryonic stem cell development and during primordial germ cell development, however,<br /><br />Treating patients during epigenetically sensitive periods would not be advisable as at this point in time, their cells are undergoing changes e.g. cell type reprogramming and change in expression patterns and so treatment during this time may disrupt establishment of normal cells and tissues i.e. production of gametes; invasive treatment at this time may damage cells and DNA, and in the case of oocytes, can not be fixed or replenished.</div>
