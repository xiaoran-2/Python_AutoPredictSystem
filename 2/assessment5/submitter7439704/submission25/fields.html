    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands silences the transcription of the particular gene. In the genesis of cancer, there  could be locus specific DNA hypermethylation and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation.DNA hypermethylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer.Consequence of hypomethylation depends on location.If it is in CpG poor promoters, it can cause oncogene activation.If it is in repeats/ Intergenic regions, it may lead genomic instability, because the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain the stability and the integrity.Hypomethylation of repeats/ intergenic intervals can lead to genomic instability by the mechanisms showed below:1)Illegitimate recombination between repeats;2)Activation of repeats and transposition;3)Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to<p>neighboring genes. All the disruptions of DNA methylation can lead to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The BWS region is organized into two imprinted domains controlled by separate ICRs. The adjacent IGF2 and H19 genes are located in one of these domains, and their imprinted expression is reciprocally controlled by a common ICR located upstream of H19 harboring a CpG island that is methylated on the paternal chromosome and unmethylated on the maternal chromosome in mice and humans. Imprinting in this domain, according to the insulator model, involves the 11-zinc-finger protein CTCF(CTCF is an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers). Loss of parent-specific methylation at this site correlates with abnormal expression of IGF2 and H19 and has been linked to patients with Wilms tumors.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine can  inhibits DNMT which promotes DNA methylation, thus shows a DNA demethylation effect.DNA methylation usually silences gene expression.DNA methylation more than they should be silences the genes they surround, including so-called tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is inheritable in mitosis because of DNMT.  When a cell with an altered DNA methylation pattern divides, DNMT can recognize the methylation pattern and methylate the new synthesized strand. So, the altering methylation pattern can have a enduring effect on the epigenome. A sensitive period is when the epigenetic marks are established and are easily influenced by the environment, which include the pre implantation period and the germ line cells. If using drugs drink this period, the normal epigenetic marks can be disrupted and they are inheritable, which also means that they are very important in the cell differentiation and development. So treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable. </div>
