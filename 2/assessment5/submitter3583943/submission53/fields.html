    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>

    <div class="field-value">In imprinting genes, only one allele is expressed depending of its origine. Disrupting them induces either no more expression of a gene or expression of both alleles.<br /><br />sketch of the H19/igf2 cluster :<br /><br />Igf2 gene - ICR (imprinting controle cluster)- H19 gene - Enhancers<br /><br />Paternal chromosome :  ICR and  H19 promoter are methylated. Because of the folding of the chromosome, the enhancers have access to Igf2 gene which is expressed while H19 is not.<br /><br />Maternal chromosome : ICR is not methylated and binds a protein : CTCF. There is no folding possible, the enhancers don't have access to Igf2 and act on H19 promoter. A long non coding RNA is synthetized.<br /><br />In Wilms tumor, the maternal chromosome has a paternal epigenotype because of the biallelically  ICR methylation : Igf2 is expressed on both chromosomes. There is double dose of Igf2. At the same time, there is no H19 gene expressed.<br /><br />When disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster, a double dose of Igf2, Insuline-like Growth Facto2, is synthetized and it increases normal and tumor cell growth.<br />H19 encodes for a long non-coding RNA that controles gene expression. How it works in Wilms tumor is not well known. It could prevent the expression of tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">- The normal fonction of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression. <br />The methylation is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure. The methylated CpG can too act in binding protein or have a DNA binding domain and transcriptional repression domain. They can also act in recruiting proteins that condense chromatin.<br />The methylation can prohibit transcriptor factor binding and alter gene expression.<br /><br />- In cancers, we can find :<br /> * loss of methylation in  CpG of CpG poor promotors (hypomethylation)<br /> * locus specific hypermethylation of CpG in island shores of tumor suppressor genes <br /><br />- * Hypomethylation :<br /> there is an activation of the associated genes that promote the syntheses of tumor growth factors ( increase cell growth), and when the hypomethylation is genome wide, there is a loss of genome stability.<br />  * hypermethylation :<br />since the tumor suppressor genes are silenced, there is no more control of the cell growth. <br /><br /><br />- The normal fonction of DNA methylation at <br /> * intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain the genome integrity, to silence cryptic promotor and translation start sites or cryptic splice sites.  The DNA is densely packaged.<br /> * silencing of repeats prevents transposon jumping  around the genome, illegitimate recombinaisons and abnormal karyotypes : deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations. <br /><br />- during cancer,  there is a genome wide  hypomethylation at repeats  and intergenic regions that leads to a genomic instability.<br />the chromatine is no more densely packaged, all what is discribed above to be prevented by methylation, happen (deletions, transposons which jump and can disrupt the coding region of a gene...), loss of genetic material...<br /><br />- transposon jumping, translocations, deletions , opening of the chromatines... can lead to silencing of tumor suppressor genes or transcription of tumor growth factors. They prevent the "normal" control and expression of these genes. <br /><br />- <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of the DNA-demethylating agents. They prevent DNA methylation.<br /><br />How it acts :<br />Its action is division dependent<br />We know that methylation is mitotically inherited. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which is incorporated in the DNA during replication. When the DNA methyl transferase comes along to bind the nucleoside in order to transfer the methyl group to the daughter strand, it is bind in an irreversible way to the analogue nucleoside. And the methyl group can not be added.<br />No more methylation is possible on all the cells but since tumor cells divide more quickly than normal cells, they are more severely affected.<br />In tumor cells, an hypermethylation of some promoters can inhibit the 
synthesis of tumor suppressor factors. The dectabine is used to prevent 
this hypermethylation and allow the synthesis of tumor suppressor 
factors.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of treatment because they prevent the methylation of the DNA. DNA methylation is mitotically inherited with the "mother" strand used as the "model" there will be no methylation of the daughter strand and so on.<br /><br />During sensitive periods, the epigenetic marks are removed and then re-established. To disrupt this methylation  induces a complete desorganisation of the genome, abnormal expression of the genes...Treating patients during these periods will affect the next generation :<br />-
 if performed in a pregnant woman during early embryonic development 
when embryonic cells must be methylated, prevented in giving an 
effective contraceptif to the woman in age of procreer before the 
beginning of the treatment<br />- in girls, the methylation of the oocytes
 will last from the birth to the puberty. The oocytes remains vulnerable
 during all the childhood <br />- in boys, the methylation of the spermatozoides is finished at birth. <br /><br />In addition to germ cell development and early embryonic development, each organ can have a sensitive period during its development : the brain activelly develops during infancy so it is a sensitive period too, treating children should be "évité. (see rat pups licking experiments)<br /></div>
