    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>In
normal cells, the CpG islands function as promoters for transcription. </p>

<p>Normally
the CpG islands are not methylated in normal cells. Methylation of the CpG
island normally will silencing the gene expression.</p>

<p>The
methylation of the CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are
mitotic heritable.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In
Cancer cells, the CpG islands are usually methylated.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The
methylation of CpG islands silence the expression of the gene associated to the
CpG islands. This cause that e.g. enzymes produced via mRNA from the gen are
not produced or produced in smaller amount. That means, that if the gen
produces enzymes that suppress cell division, then the cell division will not
be suppressed as it was before, that means the cell divides faster. Its
daughter cells inherit the CpG methylation, they will therefore also divide
faster than normal cells. The original normal cell has therefore been
transformed to cancer cells. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In
normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated.</p>

<p>The
methylation cause the DNA string to become densely packed heterochromatin.</p>

<p>The
densely packing cause that many genes are not expressed or only little
expressed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In
cancer cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not methylated.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>When the
intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not methylated the DNA string
becomes less packed than in normal cells, 
it may even become unpacked euchromatin.</span></p>

<p><span>That
cause the genes to become more expressed. Among the genes that become expressed
are gens that increase cell division. 
The daughter cells inherit the lacking methylation, they will therefore
also divide faster than normal. The original cell therefore has developed to
cancer cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>An
Imprinting Control Region (ICR) controls the expression of a gene. The
expression of the gene is among other things determined by methylation.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>On the paternal
allele the ICR for Igf2r gene is methylated. The methylation pattern of the ICR
for Igf2r is spread to the promoter H19. The promoter H19 is therefore
silenced. The enhancers to Igf2r can therefore work, they are not blocked. The
Igf2r is therefore expressed. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>On the
maternal allele, Igf2r is normally not methylated. That cause a protein CTCF to
be placed between Igf2r and the promoter H19 and enhancers to Igf2r. That
means, that the enhancers to Igf2r cannot work on Igf2r, therefore is Igf2r not
expressed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>Wilm’s
tumor:</span></p>

<p>The
imprinting of the maternal cluster can become disrupted.</p>

<p><span>If the
maternal cluster H19/Igf2r is methylated, then the isolating protein CTCF is
not placed between Igf2r and the enhancers to Igf2r. This cause Igf2r to be
expressed on both the maternal and paternal allele, it will therefore become
overexpressed. Igf2r is a growth promoter. The overexpression will cause the
cell to divide faster. The daughter cells inherit the methylation and will
therefore also divide faster, the cells have developed to Wilm’s tumor.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine:</p>

<p>Decitabine
is a DNA-demethylation drug. That is, it removes methylgroups from the DNA.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When
methylgroups are removed the DNA becomes less compact, therefore the genes
become more expressed. Among the more expressed genes are the suppressor genes
that produce mRNA, that produce proteins that suppress the division of the
cell. The production of proteins that suppress the proliferation of cells might
therefore increase and the cancer therefore fade away.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>Dectabine
is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, that is the beginning of the
serious illness myelogenous leukaemia.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA
methylation as drugs:</p>

<p>Methylation
determine how much the DNA is packed together. If it is packed heavily then few
gens are expressed. By putting methylgoups different places, it is possible to
determine which genes should be active and which genes should be passive. The
methylation is mitotic heritable. The daughter cells therefore also have the methylations.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A
sensitive period is a period, where the methylation development is fast. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>There is
two sensitive periods.</p>

<p>The
first period is when the gem cells are formed: the primordial development.</p>

<p>The
other period is the development from the zygote has been formed to epiblast. The
zygote methylations are first demhytelated, thereafter the cells are methylated
from blastocyst to epiblast, where the somatic cells are formed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>During
sensitive periods a lot of methylations or demethylations have to be done. If
you treat a patient with drugs that methylate or demethylate, then the drug might
interfere with the natural methylation and demethylation. The drug might e.g. methylate
the DNA string so that the DNA string is packed in a way, that hinder the natural
methylation can be done, or the drug might set methylgroups that is later
removed naturally.</span></p></div>
