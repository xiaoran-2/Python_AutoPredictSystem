    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:

methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>a, b, c) </p><p><span>CpG Islands are found in 60% of the promoters and high CpG density are
often <b>low methylated</b> in normal cells. But, <b>in cancer it is highly methylated</b>
causing the <b>silence of respective(s)
gene(s)</b> - CIMP or CpG island methylation phenotype. </span></p><p>This phenomenon occurs in many
cancers and these methylations depends on age, gender, tumor location, etc. Disruption
of CpG Island methylation causes expression instability like deregulation gene expression, deregulation of imprinted genes, and also silencing repression genes. These phenomena may cause
cancer.</p>

<p>d, e, f) </p>

<p><b>Repetitive sequence</b> in highly expressed sequence is highly methylated.
Scientists suppose that this is<b> a repression of noise expression.</b> The
disruption of this repression generates "noise" and instability to
the genomic expression.</p>

<p><span>DNA is often
high methylated in <b>intergenic regions</b>
this is associated with repressive histone marks.
lincRNA's (long intergenic </span>non-coding RNA) lay outside the coding region and
contain H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 domains. They help in chromatin remodeling in association
to PCR2 and are needed for pluripotency and differentiation. They can be
transcribed in both senses. Once they can repress oncogene (like p53), control
transcription factor activity and delimits apoptosis (PANDA), the disruption of
these activities causes a genomic instability. Recently has been discovered a
new function: modulation of cell cycle networks, which is induced by p53 and
repress it.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Paternal:</b> In <b>normal paterna</b>l <b>allele H19 is methylated</b>, thus H19 and CFCF are no expressed. In consequence enhancer reach Igf2 that is expressed.</p>

<p><b>Maternal:</b> In<b> normal maternal allele H19 is not methylated</b>, thus Igf2 and CTCF are expressed. In consequence downstream enhancers are insulated.</p>

<p><b>Wilms tumor:</b><br /></p><p>In Wilms tumor <b>non methylation at maternal  ICRs</b> generates an overexpression of Igf2</p><p>This disruption generates Wilms tumor, a childhood kidney cancer.<br /></p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine epigentic
inhibitors:  DNA-demethylating agent</p>

<p>This drug treats myelodysplastic syndromes:
precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia</p>

<p><span>Chromatin modifying enzymes such as HMTs is correlated
with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) thus DNA-demethylating agent will work against
this histone methyltransferase enzyme.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation have effects that last beyond
the period because mitotic heritability  maintains cell identity such that most
or all epigenetic states of the mother cell are conveyed.</p><p>G1/S, when the cell replicates its genetic
material, should be the sensitive period. </p><p>



</p><p><span>In these periods the introduction of drugs will
be lethal to Normal cells.</span></p></div>
