    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are frequent at promoters, and the normal function of CpG methylation is gene silencing. However, in normal conditions CpG islands tent to be protected from methylation. In cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands is observed, particularly of the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, which become silenced, promoting cell growth, and thus the growth of the tumor. It has been observed that CpG island shores are also hypermethylated in cancer.<br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally hypermethylated in the genome, which seems to help maintain genomic integrity by silencing strong promoters that can be found on repetitive elements, preventing transposition, and also preventing illegitimate recombination. In cancer, both intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated. This leads to increased non-allelic recombination between repetitive elements with high sequence similarity, activation of transposons and their internal promoters and increased frequency of genomic rearrangements (translocation, deletion, duplication).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, the ICR of the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 locus is methylated, therefore the downstream enhancers interact with Igf2, which is actively transcribed exclusively from the paternal chromosome. The maternal allele is unmethylated at the ICR and therefore the ICR can bind CTCF. CTCF acts as an insulator, allowing the downstream enhancers to intreat with H19, which is then only expressed (transcribed) from the maternal chromosome.<br />In individuals with Wilm's tumor there is loss of imprinting in the H19/Igf2 locus, and both alleles become methylated, acting like the normal paternal allele. In this scenario, There is two fold expression of Igf2, a growth promoting factor, and no expression of H19.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor. Decitabine prevents establishment of methylation on the newly synthesized DNA strand after DNA replication. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated during DNA replication that binds DNMTs irreversibly. It seems to be effective at treating hematopoietic malignancies, like AML, that are common in elderly individuals and are characterized by CpG island hypermehtylation. The tumor cells will be more susceptible to Decitabine because they divide constantly, and it seems that this drug reduces methylation of CpG islands, possibly allowing reactivation of tumor-supressor genes. However, the exact mechanism of action is unclear at this time.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can me mitotically inherited because of the action of DNA methyl transferases that 'copy' the methylation from the parent DNA strand and lay it on the daughter strand, effectively maintaining previously established methylation in the genome. This is why it can have an effect that lasts longer than chemotherapy, which only works until the drug is cleared from the body.<br />The two better understood sensitive periods of development occur during early embryonic development and during primordial germ cell development. However, there are other timeframes during development in which certain organs are being formed, or while specific cells are being differentiated, that are relevant, but not as extensive as the first two. During these sensitive periods epigenetic reprogramming and reseting is occurring both for cell-lineage-specific development and for imprinted regions. These stages are extremely relevant for appropriate early development of the embryo and proper formation of gametes, therefore it would be inadvisable to used drugs that alter DNA methylation in these stages as they may lead to infertility, developmental issues or death (depending on the exact stage).</div>
