    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the normal cells imprinting mechanism is well regulated which maintains the proper gene expression. But during cancer cells hyper methylation or hypomethylation of ICRs ( Imprinting control regions) takes place which results in over expression of oncogenes or inactivates the expression of tumor supressor genes.<br /><br />one such example is in imprinting mechanism of H19/Igf2. In the normal cells the ICR is methylated in the paternal allele. This causes the enhancers to act on Igf2 and the expression of Igf2 increases where as in the maternal allele ICRis unmethylated and CTCF binds as insulator. So the enhancer increases the expression of H19.<br /><br />But in case of cancer cells ICR of maternal allele is also methylated as a result there is no binding of insulator and enhancer act on Igf2. expression of Igf2 increases. Due to this increased expression of Igf2 it results in Wilm's tumor. In this case the cancer is the result of hyper methylation of imprinting region.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the normal cells CpG islands are<b> hypomethylated </b>and these regions gets methylated only to supres gene expression. And the number of methylated CpG island is also very less in normal cells. <br /><br /> But in case of Cancer cells CpG islands are hyper methylated which leads to the supression of tumor suprressor genes. Example is BRCA1 in breast cancer and<b> RB in retinoblastoma.</b> 2Kb upstream and downstream of  CpG islands also gets hypermethylated called  <b>CpGshores.</b> In some cases CpG hypometylated which leads to the over expression of  oncogenes. The best example is RAS in gastric cancer.<br /><br />In the normal cells intergenic region  and repetitive elements are highly methylated, which is important to exclude the unwanted genes to get transmited. but in case of cancer intergenic region and  repetitive elements are hypo methylated. this leads to the oncogene expression, and also causes genetic instability. <br /><br /><br />Therefore the epigenetic changes such as hypermethyaltion of tumor supressor gene and  hypomethylation of genome wide sequence results in cancer. these modifications can be used for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA methyl transferase inhibitors (DNMTi). these are the class of inhibitors that act as hypomethylating agents by inhibiting DNA methylation. These are nucleosides analogs and irreversibly bind to DNA methyl transferase and also incorporated into the  DNA. <br /><br />Decitabine also shows the same effect on DNA methylation. It inhibits the methylation of promoter sites of tumor supressor genes OR CpG islands in the upstream region of supressor gene,  hence increase the supressor gene expression. It is one of the FDA approved drug for the cancer therapy especially in treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. it is effective at low concentration and higher concentration has some side effects. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a key regulator of gene expression. It is also important to maintain genetic and chromosomal stability. any change in methylation pattern (both hypo/hyper) results in cancer. <br />so care has to be taken to in the early period of embryonic development where imprinting takesplace. and also during germ cells development. During chemotherapy there is also chances of damage to the normal methylation pattern in the germ cells or normal cells. Therefore treatment with epigenetic modifier drugs is not advisable during early stges of life(young age) as it may affect germ cell development and also during pregnancy. </div>
