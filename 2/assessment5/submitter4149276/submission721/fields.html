    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Methylation
of CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements is altered in cancer
cells from its normal state.  These
changes result in genes being activated and inactivated inappropriately leading
to the uncontrolled growth associated with cancerous cells.  Each cancer type has a unique pattern of methylation
changes that can be diagnostic for the cancer type.</span></p>

<p> Most
CpG islands in promoter regions are unmethylated in normal cells, especially
for tumor suppressor genes, activating the genes.  When these regions are hypermethylated in
cancer cells, expression of these tumor suppressor genes is turned off and
cancers can ensue.  There are however,
also CpG poor promoters that are usually methylated in normal cells.  If these are in promoters for oncogenes or
miRNAs that target tumor suppressor genes, and they are turned on through
hypomethylation, cancers may ensue.  Different
types of cancer have different patterns of hyper- and hypo- methylation of the
promoter regions of genes.</p>

<p> Intergenic
regions of DNA and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in normal
cells.  This hypermethylation is
associated with their condensation into heterochromatin and subsequent
silencing.  This is important for the stabilization
of the genome and is progressively reversed during oncogenesis.  If repetitive elements are located within
euchromatin (open structure of DNA), they can migrate within the genome.  They can also cause recombinations of the DNA.  These mutations to the DNA can result in the
activation of oncogenes, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and other
abnormalities, often associated with growth genes which leads to cancer.  It can be seen that genetic abnormalities and
epigenetics are interrelated and can have effects on one another, both
contributing to the onset of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Genes associated with cellular
growth are often expressed from only one parental allele and this is controlled
by ICRs, imprint control regions.  In
cancerous cells, these ICRs can be affected resulting in both alleles being
turned on or off.  In the case of the
H19/Igf2 cluster, normal cells express from only one allele and cancerous cells
express Igf2 from both parental alleles. 
This overexpression of Igf2 is associated with cancerous growth.</span></p>

<p> In normal cells, paternal ICRs are
methylated, preventing CTCF (insulator) binding.  Methylation spreads to the promoter region of
H19 resulting in H19 silencing, though H19 function is not associated with Igf2
function.  Lack of CTCF allows downstream
enhancers to access the Igf2 gene and it’s expressed through chromatin looping.  Maternal ICRs are unmethylated and so CTCF
can bind.  This prevents the enhancers
from interacting with the Igf2 gene causing it to be inactivated.  The enhancers then work on their secondary
binding site, H19.</p>

<p> In Wilm’s tumor cells, both alleles
are methylated at the ICR and cannot bind CTCF. 
The enhancers can act on both Igf2 alleles causing it to be
overexpressed (a double dose of gene product). 
This causes more growth associated with cancer onset.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is one of
four drugs currently approved by the FDA to treat cancer by targeting
epigenetic enzymes.  This particular drug
is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome once it has progressed to AML and is
a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  Decitabine
is a nucleoside analog that enters the binding site of DNMT and prevents
addition of methyls to the daughter strand of DNA during replication.  This results in demethylation of the DNA.  While the exact mechanism of action is still
unclear it may be that this reverses the hypermethylation of tumor suppressor
genes, turning them back on and thus having an anti-tumor effect.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation can be inherited
mitotically and so once altered in a cell, be maintained for many generations
of cell growth and replication.  These
marks are remodeled at “sensitive periods” in organism development.  These include germ cell creation, early development
and cell differentiation (from stem cells). 
During these time periods, imprinting of genes is established as well as
laying down cell type specific markings. 
Treating patients during these times might alter these necessary
markings causing unknown, deleterious side effects.  The drugs discussed in this course were
mentioned to be used primarily on older individuals who presumably are not
procreating.  It would be inadvisable to
have germ cells, embryos and differentiating cells exposed to these drug
types.  In older patients, there is less
risk of cell differentiation being affected (though somatic stem cells may be
affected) and less risk of altered germ cells being passed to the next generation.</span></p></div>
