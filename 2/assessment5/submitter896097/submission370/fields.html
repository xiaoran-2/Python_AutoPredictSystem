    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The reason for methylation at CpG islands is to to <strong>silence the genes</strong> with which the particular CpG island is associated. In cancer, CpG islands tend to be <strong>hypermethylated</strong> leading to gene silencing. When this happens in the case of tumor supressor genes, cancer can be seen.<br />  <br />Intergenic regions of DNA and repetitive elements need to be silenced to inactivate transposible elements and hence to maintain the genomic stability. In cancer, these intergenic sequences are <strong>not</strong> methylated. This can lead to incorrect transcription, genomic instability which inturn can cause cancer. When the intergenic sequences are not methylated, <strong>transposible elements become active</strong>, <strong>illegitimate recombination</strong> can take-place, thus leading to cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In paternal allele, the H19 region and the imprint control region are methylated. Thus, the enhancers act on IgF2 and IgF2 is expressed.<br />In maternal allele, CTCF binds to the imprint control region. Thus, enhancers act on H19 and it is expressed. Igf2 is not expressed. When the imprint control region is hypermethylated, even the maternal allele's ICR is also methylated. Normal imprinting is disrupted. This leads to the production of double dose of IgF2. IgF2, being a growth promoter, causes abnormal growth resulting in cancer tumors.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyl transferase inhibitors. It binds to the DNA and results in hypomethylation opf DNA. This hypomethylation of DNA in cancerous cells can restore the normal functioning of the cells. In this way, Decitabine can have anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an important phenomenon that determines the expression state of a gene. This can have enduring effects on the genome as it is mitotically heritable.<br /><br />Sensitive period is the time when the epigenetic marks are erased/re-established. Normally, Blastocyst stage of development and primordial germ-cell development are the sensitive periods.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because, the genome, at this period is sensitive to external signals and any drug that interferes with epigenetic reprogramming can lead to undesirable side-effects. <br /><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span><br /></div>
