    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a kind of DNMT (DNA methyltransferase) inhibitor. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia. Decitabine is a non selective drug and it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting the activity of DNMT. The purpose of Decitabine is to hypomethylate the tumor suppressor genes in the cancer cells to induce subsequent apoptosis to the tumors. A mutated DNMT may hypermethylate the cell, including its tumor suppressor genes. Decitabine will be able to return the methylation profile of the cancer cell into normal level and able to suppress the ongoing cell division. When Decitabine (DNMT inhibitor) is used with combination of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and standard chemotherapy, they will produce synergistic effect.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is widely found at the CpG islands, the region upstream of a coding sequence. Methylated CpG island suggests the gene being silenced as the methylation hinders the transcription factors and promoters to bind to the upstream region of the gene. Hypermethylation in CpG islands is normally associated to cancer but the exact CpG island sites vary according to tumor type. In cancer cells, the CpG islands of the tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated and hence the genes are silenced. The cancer cells will not induce apoptosis and stand a chance to divide continuously. Moreover, this methylation pattern is mitotically heritable and the effect of hypermethylation increases with age. Recently, hypermethylation in CpG island shores (2kb neighboring CpG islands) might be used to identify tumor cells as it correlates well with gene expression.<br />In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are supposed to be methylated and silenced. This is because these sequences will cause genomic instability and disrupt the integrity of other essential coding sequences. In tumor cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. Hypomethylation in these regions occur to some degree in all tumors tested and progress with tumorigenicity. In tumor cells, when the oncogenes are hypomethylated, they will be expressed and continuously divide as there is signal to actively divide is constantly present in the cell. The cancer cells will have abnormal karyotype due to genomic instability where activities such as gene insertion, deletion and reciprocal translocation take place to disrupt the genetic stability. Other events such as abnormal recombination between repeats, activation of transposons, and activation of cryptic promoters are results from genomic instability in tumor cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation have lasting effect beyond the treatment period because the epigenetic pattern can be inherited mitotically. Epigenetic drug usually targets elderly adult to lengthen their survivability. It has to be administered cautiously especially during the sensitive period. Sensitive period spans from cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until the epigenetic marks in the cells are actively erased. It is the critical period when epigenetics marks are laid down onto the cell which is then heritable every time the cells divides. The sensitive period takes place during gametogenesis and after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). For example during the embryo stage and during adolescent are said to be sensitive periods. Treating these patients during these sensitive periods can alter or erase some of their epigenetic profile forever hence it is not advisable to do so. Long term of lifelong effects will follow if the epigenetics profile is changed.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations of the methylation profile at the Imprinting Control Region (ICR) may result in over expression of the oncogenes and the down regulation of the tumor suppressor genes. In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and the methylation pattern spread to silence the H19 gene downstream, there will be no available binding site for CTCF and hence the adjacent enhancer will up regulate the expression of Igf2 gene. In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, there will be a molecule of CTCF binds to the ICR. H19 gene is not methylated and hence the enhancer will further enhance the binding of promoter or transcription factor onto the H19 gene and up regulate its expression. In Wilm's tumor, hypermethylation occurs in both the paternal and maternal allele of this specific ICR. The methylation spreads downstream and silenced the adjacent H19 gene. The enhancer can only activate the Igf2 gene on both alleles. Igf2 over expression takes place and the protein coded by the cell is insulin like growth factor 2. As the name suggests, it will be an overdose of growth factor to promote cell division and eventually formation of tumor.<br /></div>
