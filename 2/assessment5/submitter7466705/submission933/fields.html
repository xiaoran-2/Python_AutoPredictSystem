    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Hypermethylation at CpG islands is usually associated with gene silencing and these regions are usually hypermethylated in cancer cells.  The increase in hypermethylation can silence tumor suppressor genes and when these genes are silenced, they lead to cancer.  Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is more common that mutations that inactivate gene transcription.  Methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements serve to stabilize the genome.  With cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated.  They hypomethylation leads to genomic instability because repetitive DNA is able aberrantly recombine with other regions of the genome, lead to the activation of repeats and transposition, and activate cryptic promoters and/or disrupt neighboring gene expression.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer cells, ICRs can be either hypomethylated or hypermethylated and this alteration is often an early change in precancerous cells.  One example is the H19/Igf2 imprinting cluster.  In a normal cell, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and the ICR remains unmethylated on the maternal allele.  The methylation of the ICR blocks the binding of the insulator, CTCF, and allows enhancers to promote expression of igf2.  In cancer cells, such as Wilm's tumor cells, both the maternal and the paternal ICRs are methylated.  This leads activation of igf2 on both alleles and increases the expression of igf2, which is a growth factor.  The presence of more growth factor leads to cell proliferation, thus contributing to cancer.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor that functions as a DNA-demethylating agent.  Thus, with the administration of decitabine, DNA will become hypomethylated.  In cancer cells, the reduction in methylation could lead to the reactivation of tumor suppressor genes, the genes responsible for growth regulation.  An interesting finding was that administering a combination of histone-deacetylase inhibitor with a DNA-demethylation agent in patients led to slowing of tumor growth and show a better response to chemotherapeutic drugs.  These drugs could potentially erase the cancerous epigenetic marks, halting tumor growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, meaning once a cancerous epigenetic alteration occurs in the mother cell, it is inherited by the daughter cells.  The administration of Histone-deactylase inhibitors and DNA-demethylating agents could potentially reverse alterations leading to cancer.  However, there are periods of sensitivity during development, mainly germ cell development and the period following fertilization until formation of the epiblast.  These sensitive periods are when epigenetic marks are cleared and reestablished.  Therefore, I would caution treating younger patients that are still developing germ cells and of reproductive age with epigenetic inhibitors.  </div>
