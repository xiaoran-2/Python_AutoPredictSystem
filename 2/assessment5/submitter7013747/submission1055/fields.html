    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation in cancer is very often altered: <br />In a normal cell, CpGi are generally unmethylated and protected from methylation. They thus have a role in the silencing mechanism (e.g. methylation of a CpGi upstream of a particular gene will induce silencing of this gene). In a cancer cell, those islands tend to be hypermethylated, and this progresses with time. The consequence is that tumour suppressor genes (such as RB gene in retinoblastoma) are silenced via the upstream CpGi hypermethylation.<br />DNA methylation also occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Those elements are normally hypermethylated, in order to increase genome stability. In a cancer cell, they tend to be hypomethylated, therefore increasing genome instability (either by activating repetitive elements, disrupting neighboring genes).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer, hypermethylation of ICRs contributes to the loss of imprinting. For example, in the H19/Igf2 cluster : <br />The paternal allele has its ICR methylated, preventing the insulator CTCF from binding, thus permitting  the enhancers downstream to activate Igf2 expression.<br />The maternal allele has its ICR unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind to the ICR and insulating Igf2 from the downstream enhancers, in turn expressing H19.<br />In Wilm's tumour, the imprinting is loss, and the maternal allele is methylated, like the paternal allele, thus preventing the insulator to bind, resulting in Igf2 expression and H19 repression.<br />Igf2 being a growth promoting protein, a double dose will thus increase and deregulate cell growth, a common feature in cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic modifications are very common in cancer, and reversible. Therefore they are a target for drug therapy. Decitabine is one of those drugs, and is a DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). Decitabine, as a DNMTi will  decrease DNA methylation levels, depending on its dose. This decreased methylation level has an anti-neoplastic effect. Indeed, by decreasing the DNA methylation level, the above mentioned problems with hypermethylation in cancer are reduced. (Silencing of tumour suppressing genes, loss of imprinting).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The epigenome, that is to say the epigenetic modifications pool of a cell, is transmissible throughout cell division. It is usually mitotically heritable, and in some cases meiotically heritable (such as the IAPs or repeats elements methylation). Therefore, the alteration of DNA methylation in a cell can be passed down to the daughter cells after division, along many generations. Altering DNA methylation can thus have enduring effects on the epigenome.<br />Besides, throughout development, an organism will experience 2 sensitive periods, that is to say a period of epigenetic reprogramming where the epigenome is much more sensitive to environmental insults : during the early development, and during Primordial Germ Cell development (PGC). Combined with the heritability of epigenetic modifications, and the existence of those 2 sensitive periods, using drugs that alter DNA methylation has to be monitored, in order not to be used during a sensitive period, as the changes can be passed on to the children of the patient, and/or can last even after the period of drug treatment, thus having more negative effects than positive ones.</div>
