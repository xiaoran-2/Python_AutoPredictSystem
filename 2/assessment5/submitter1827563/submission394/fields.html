    <h1>Submission 394 from Anon (session_user_id: beb3320134112a95dc876b622ea76b4480b571d8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents class.<br />It is  inhibiting DNA methyltransferase that leads to DNA hypomethylated.<br />It is functioning in a similar manner to azacitidine that in a combination with a histone-deacetylase inhibitor slowed tumour growth in advanced lung cancer.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In 60% of the promoter regions there are high density island of CpG. DNA methylation of promoter region correlates inversely with gene expression. That means DNA methylation of them results in silencing the gene. In a normal gene the CpG island must be free of methylation no matter of their state of activity.<br />In a cancer cell the CpG island of the promoter region become hypermethylated which generates silencing the gene. If the gene is a tumor-supressor, silencing will generate uncontrolled proliferation of the cells.<br />Also unusually high frequency of CpG methylation (named CIMP) generates microsatellite instability and genetic mutation founded in colorectal cancer, brest, glioma.<br />Another type of aberrant methylation in the colorectal cancer and nerve sheath tumor is CpG island shores which is related with gene expression.<br /><br />In a normal cell, in highly expressed genes was founded methylation at intragenic region and repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats. A possible explanation  was that may repress the transcriptional noise generated in alternative site starts or inhibit antisense transcription.<br />A direct hypomethylation in the repetitive region was detected in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. The variation in wide-genome methylation, gain or loss, generates genome instability , deregulation of tissues , imprinting genes, apoptosis and  DNA repair.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genes imprinting is achived by methylation. <br />It was discovered that the Igf2  is inherited as an imprinted gene expressed on paternally allele, while H19 another imprinted gene is expressed on the maternally allele.<br />In the study of Igf2 gene expression it was discovered a region upstream of the gene that is more methylated on the paternal chromosome than the maternal. The loci more close to 5' to this region were highly methylated, whereas loci closely to 3'  were almost entirely unmethylated. Paternal allelic methylation in the 3' part of the Igf2 gene was found correlated with expression.<br />Likewise, in the neighbouring of imprinted H19 gene similar process was discovered but in an inverse manner that are more methylated on the paternal (repressed) allele than on the maternal allele.<br /><br />In  Wilms tumors was discovered the maternal Igf2 imprint is relaxed thus the gene is expressed biallelically and that is correlated with low level of H19 expression, and a reversal in the patterns of DNA methylation of the maternally inherited Igf2 and H19 genes.<br />Hl9 appears to be an unusual class of tumor suppressor gene, which is silenced in some Wilms tumors by DNA methylation.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">That is possible because of mitotic inheritance : epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells.<br />The sensitive period id the period when are made various change in the epigenetic markers(like clearing the epigenetic marks in germ cells).<br />One of the sensitive period of development is during the epigenetic reprogamming in early development.<br /><br /></div>
