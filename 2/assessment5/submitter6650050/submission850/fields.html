    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, the CpG islands are generally not methylated. The genes corresponding to those CpG islands are expressed. Those genes are often tumor supressor genes.<br />In cancer cells, the CpG islands often become hypermethylated. This may lead to the silencing of the corresponding tumor suppressor genes.<br />In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. This is important for the stability of the genome, i.e. avoiding the expression of these regions which might lead to transpositions, illegitimate recombinations, activation of cryptic promoters...<br />In cancer cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated and can thus be expressed. This leads to genomic instability, which in turn may lead to anomalies in the karyotype and contribute to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, leading to expression of Igf2.<br />On  the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, leading to silencing of Igf2.<br />In Wilm's tumor, the ICR is methylated on the maternal allele as well as on the paternal allele, leading to twice as much Igf2 being produced.<br />As Igf2 promotes cell growth, increased expression of Igf2 leads to cellular proliferation and thus to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, an DNA-methyltranferase inhibitor (DNMTi).<br />It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.<br />It is a nucleoside analog. It gets incorporated into the DNA during replication. It is then able to irreversibly bind DNA methyltransferase, and so block the action of DNA methyltransferase.<br />It is only effective on cells who are replicating. Cancer cells will be more severely affected than normal cells because they are replicating more. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. It is believed to be most effective on haematological malignancies because those are dependent on tumor supressor gene hypermethylation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.<br />A sensitive period is a period where epigenetic marks are being established: early development and germ cell development.<br />Whe should avoid treating patients during sensitive periods (eg treating young patients who have developing germ cells), because the epigenetic drugs do not specifically target cancer cells, they can affect all cells, and they could have a very negative effect on those cells who are undergoing epigenetic reprogramming.<br /></div>
