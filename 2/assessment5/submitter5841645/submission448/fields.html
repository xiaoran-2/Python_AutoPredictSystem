    <h1>Submission 448 from Anon (session_user_id: 68c34f6c9327277afa630d18f327da34cd54f4c6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to  DMTi (DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor). As a nuceloside analogues, it could be incorporated in to DNA during replication. DMTi disrupt DNA methylation by binding to DMT irreversibly. Since some cancer are correlated to Locus specific hypermethylation, for example hypermethylation at CpG island , CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes , and ICRs. The Decitabine exert its anti-tumour effect by relieving the hypermethylation at specific locus thus restore the function of tumor suppressor genes and prevent loss of imprinting. <br /><em></em></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, the methylation of CpG island leads to gene silence.However, in cancer, the hypermethylation of CpG island is very common. Usually, these specific hypermethyaltion silence the tumor suppressor genes whose normal function is to regulate cell growth and prevent cancer. As a result, the silencing of these gene may lead to the development of cancer.<br />The DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is very important for maintaining genomic stability. In cancer, a pattern of genome wide hypomethylation is observed. The hypomethylation at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements increase the genomic stability and contribute to the development of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele of the imprinting control region is methylated, which inhibit CTCF binding, thus allow the enhancer to act on Igf 2. Ultimately, this leads to Igf expression. While on the maternal side, the unmethylated CTCF will bind to its insular element. This binding block the enhancer's interaction with Igf, so it only act on H 19 and there will be no expression of Igf 2.<br />In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele is also metylated, the patient will have double dose of Igf expression. Since Igf will promote growth, the overdose lead to the overgrowth contribute to the development of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is maintained by DNMT1. This enzyme works in a way which makes the DNA methylation mitotically inheritable, so the altered DNA methylation can be passed to the daughter cells. Even the drug is removed, the alteration can be maintained by this Enzyme.<br />A sensitive period is a period during which the cell undergo dynamic epigenetic reprogramming, when many epigenetic marks are removed and reset.  Early development and primordial cell development are such periods. Since drugs that have an effect on epigenetic machinery will greatly changed the environment of the those sensitive cell, the overall effect will be great and hard to predict. Therefore, it's better to use these drugs in a period of higher epigenetic stability, which will have less unexpected effect.</div>
