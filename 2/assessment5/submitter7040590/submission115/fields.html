    <div class="field-value">Regarding DNA methylation pattern, normal cells tend to be relatively unmethylated at CPG islands in comparison to cancer cells. CPG island are normally found at the promoter regions of genes, and the normal function of DNA methylation at these islands is gene silencing. In cancer cells, CPG island are globally hypermethylated, and many of these hypermethylated CPG islands are in the promoters of tumor supressor genes, which because they have been silenced, the cancer cells will proliferate more than normally. Regarding DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, the opposite methylation pattern is observed. While normal cells tend to be methylated at these regions, cancer cells are hypomethylated. It is belived that the normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetive elements is to maintain genomic instability. That is because DNA methylation per se is mutagenic since a methylated cytosine can be easily transformed to a thymine. Then in normal cell DNA methylation at these region prevent deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions, transpositions, transcription interference from strong promoters and illegitimate recombination. In cancer cells, on the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are globally hypomethylated, and therefore, genomic instability and mutagenicity would be increased. The study of the hypermethylated CPG islands have indicated that they are different for each type of tumor and according to the stage of the tumor, so that a panel of hypermethylated CPG island are becoming more and more useful as biomakers that could improve the specificity of diagnosis, and the prognosis of the patient such as the reponse to certain treatment.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele the ICR and the promoter region of the H19 gene are hypermethylated. The CTCF can not bind the ICR, and consequently the enhancers located upstream can then act on the Igf2 gene increasing its expression. In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, and bind the CTCF. The Igf2 is silent and the enhancer increase the expression of H19. In the Wilm's tumor, the ICR in both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated, so that the expression of Igf2 is double dosed. As a consequence, there is an increase in cell growth and tumorigenesis. It seems that these kind of modification of imprinted genes ICRs are an early event of tumorigenesis.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There are different classes of potential epigenetic targets in cancer research. Among the ones which have published drugs under tests or already approved are inhibitors for enzymes such as DNMT, HDAC, HMT, HAT and HDMT. Decitabine belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi) and it is an FDA approved drug for myelodisplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. Being a DNMTi, Decitabine will inhibit DNA methylation, and should decrease the hypermethylation of cpg island which is characteristically found in cancers in general.  The anti-tumour effect of Decitabine  could be related to the re-expression of tumor suppressor genes and/or apoptosis-related genes which had been silenced by hypermethylation (Malik and Cashen, 2014; Navada et al., 2014) . It is not known whether are there other underlying mechanisms, but it 
seems that the drug is well tolerated by the elderly patients who undergo 
treatment.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation pattern have lasting effects because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. So it is perfectly possible, considering an epigenetic modification caused by a change in DNA methylation which has made cells more susceptible to chemotherapy, that such effect will last beyond the drug treatment. These types of drugs which may alter the epigenetic marks must be avoided during critical periods when epigenetic remodelling is most active. During early development, there are two sensitive periods of intense epigenetic remodelling, the first between pre-implantation to early post-implantation of the embryo and then in midgestation during the primordial germ cell development. Because of this intense epigenetic remodelling in the embryo it is completely inadvisable to treat pregnant women with these type of drugs, because they would disrupt the normal development in such a way that could compromise the viability of the embryo or its germ cell line. However, as we learned more about the influence of the environment on the epigenome, I consider that we are susceptible to epigenetic modifications in any period of life, which may not lead necessarily to death, but could change importantly our physiology and even our behavior. That is what fascinate me about epigenetics!<br /></div>
