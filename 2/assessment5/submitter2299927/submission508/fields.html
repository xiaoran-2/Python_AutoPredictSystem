    <div class="field-value"><p><span>·       
</span><b>In
human genome, the </b><span>CpG dinucleotides are concentrated in short CpG-rich DNA stretches called
‘CpG islands’, located at the 5′ end of genes.
They are found in 60% of human promoters. The majority of CpG islands usually
remain unmethylated during development and in differentiated tissues, but  there are some CpG island promoters that become
methylated during development and this results in long-term transcriptional
silencing. Examples:  X-chromosome inactivation and imprinted genes.
DNA methylation lead to gene silencing.</span></p>

<p><span><span>·       
</span><span>Cancer initiation and progression are accompanied by
profound changes in DNA methylation. A cancer epigenome is marked by site-specific
<b>CpG island</b> promoter <b>hypermethylation</b>.</span></span></p>

<p><span>·       
</span>The site-specific hypermethylation contributes to
tumorigenesis by silencing tumor suppressor genes.<b> </b><span>The CpG island hypermethylation of the <i>Rb</i> promoter
leads to the silencing of the tumor suppressor gene.</span><b> </b><span><span>Many other tumor suppressor genes involved in cellular processes undergo tumor-specific
silencing by hypermethylation.  </span></span></p>

<p><span>·       
</span><span>Normally, t<span>he repetitive genomic sequences from
the human genome are heavily methylated and this prevents <b>chromosomal instability</b> by silencing non-coding DNA and
transposable DNA elements. DNA methylation prevents or promots the recruitment
of regulatory proteins to DNA. It inhibits transcriptional activation by
blocking transcription factors from accessing target-binding sites.</span><b></b></span></p>

<p><span>·       
</span><span><b>DNA hypomethylation</b> plays a significant role in
tumorigenesis. This occurs at various genomic sequences: repetitive elements,
retrotransposons, CpG poor promoters, introns and gene deserts. </span>Hypomethylation in cancer is found in
intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>

<p><span>·       
</span><span><span>DNA hypomethylation at repeat sequences leads to
increased genomic instability by promoting <b>chromosomal
rearrangements</b>. Hypomethylation of retrotransposons can result in their
activation and translocation to other genomic regions, thus increasing genomic
instability. Loss of DNA methylation and genomic instability is implicated in a
variety of human cancers. DNA hypomethylation also lead to the activation of
growth-promoting genes. DNA hypomethylation leads to aberrant
activation of genes and non-coding regions.</span><b></b></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>·      </span><span>H19 is expressed only from
the maternal allele whereas IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele. The <b>paternal</b> allele is <b>hypermethylated </b>in the promoter region. The
IGF2 promoter region is not methylated. Two DMR on the expressed paternal allele have been identified: the DMR1 promoter acts as a silencer on the maternal allele
when it is unmethylated, and the DMR2, which is an activator on the paternal
allele when it is methylated. The ICR controls the chromatin structure and
regulates the effect of enhancers located downstream of the H19 gene. On the
paternal allele, methylation of the ICR represses the H19 expression and
prevents the attachment of the CTCF protein. So enhancers can activate the IGF2
expression from this allele. </span></p>

<p><span>·       
</span>On the maternal allele, the CTCF protein interacts with the
non-methylated ICR. This interaction prohibits enhancers to access the IGF2
gene.</p>

<p><span>·       
</span>In Wilm’s tumour, the
ICR on the maternal allele is methylated. Methylation of the maternal ICR
prevents CTCF from binding and allows for the enhancers to access the Igf2
promoter.</p>

<p><span><span>·       
</span><b>Disrupting imprinting of
the cluster produces the upregulating of Igf2 that promotes cell growth,
resulting an uncontrolled cell growth.</b></span></p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine
belong to the class of  a DNA
methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi), </span>DNA
demethylating agents.</p>

<p>Decitabine is converted intracellularly to a triphosphate
which is incorporated into DNA and appears to inhibit DNA methylation.

Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase,
an enzime that removes methyl groups from silenced promoter sequences.</p>

<p><span>Decitabine
 leads to demethylation of CpG islands in
tumor suppressor genes.</span> <span>By this process
of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored,
thus restoring control over cell growth. For example: <i>p21</i> (a tumor supresor gene) might be a target gene for decitabine-mediated gene demethylation. After decitabine treatment there is an  epigenetic reactivation of this locus                     might contribute to the therapeutic effects observed in pacients.<b></b></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is
mitotically heritable.  Changing the DNA
methylation pattern produce effects that last beyond mitosis.Epigenetic changes are passed on during mitosis to daughter cells until they are actively erase and do not return.</span></p>

<p>Sensitive periods are
particular periods characterized by the clearing and resetting of the epigenetic
marks. DNA methylation patterns are established in these periods.</p>

<p>Sensitive periods are:
germ cell development and early embryonic development.</p>

In sensitive periods sensitive periods the epigenetic marks are
     being established and inhibiting DNA methylation could have more
     pronounced effects on the genome at these times. There are periods when there is a higher chance to mutations.</div>
