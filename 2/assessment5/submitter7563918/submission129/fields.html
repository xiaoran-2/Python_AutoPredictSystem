    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with silencing of gene expression. CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation. The first mechanism is because the meCpG in a CpG island is associated  with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure. Is beacuse the meCpG can be bound by methylated CpG binding proteins, meCpG proteins have a  DNA binding domain transcriptional repression domain, meCpG proteins can recruit other factors tan condense the chromatin..</p><p>The second mechanism is because meCpG can prohibit transcription factor binding and alter gene expression and we don´t have transcription.<br /></p><p>DNA methylation occurs predominantly at CpG dinucleotides. DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with gene silencing when found promotors. It helps to maintain genomic stability. Laid down by DNAmetiltranferases. And is essential for viability of a cell or for life.</p><p>In normal cell hypomethylated CpG islands. And the intergenic regions, introns of genes and repetitive elements are hypermethylated.</p><p>In cancer one aberration in epigenetic control is CpG islands hypermethylation that silence tumour suppressor genes, genetically or epigenetically by silencing the tumour suppressor gene by locking in a silent inactivate state; The cell to divide more rapidly, outcompete neighboring cells and grow into a tumour.</p><p>In cancer cell CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated, not all methylated but they´re more likely to be methylated than in normal cell. </p><p>The normal function in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is maintenain genomic stability or genomic integrity. Prevent transposition, and prevent recombination.</p><p>In normal cell the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated.</p><p>In cancer have hypomethylation genome-wide lead genomic instability. Leads to deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the chromosomes.</p><p>In cancer the repetitive elements and intergenic elements and introns are hypomethylated. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation of ICR - loss of imprinting</p><p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs ( hypo or hypermethylation ), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p><p>Common, early event, often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue: Hypermethylation of ICR, lgf2 overexpression in Wilm´s tumour.</p><p>In normal cell  on the Paternal allele ICR is methylated, the enhancers can act on lgf2 because CTCF is not binding to inhibit this and lfg2 is expressed from the pattern allele.</p><p>On the maternal allele ICR is unmethylated, CTCF binds its insulator element, enhancers will act on H19. But lgf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so we don´t see expression.</p><p>If you have hypermethylation of ICR, on the maternal allele you also have expression of lgf2. So now have a double dose of lgf2 in comparison in a normal cell and lgf2 is both growth promoting and this is associated with Wilm´s tumour.</p><p>Hypermethylation of ICR leads to a loss of H19 gene activity and increased activity of Igf2 gene in many tissues. A loss of H19, which normally restrains  growth, and an increase in Igf2, which promotes growth, together lead to overgrowth and an increased risk of tumours. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug, the class is DNA-demethylating agents. Is a DNA methylatransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). Contribute to hypomethylation of DNA.</p><p>Nucleoside analogues. They get incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind, the DNMTi comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversible and it can no longer be released; the action of these DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent, so you have to have the cell replication.</p><p>Much lower doses of Decitabine do have a very good anti-tumour effect or anti-neoplastic effect, you are killing the tumour cells because they seem to be causing hypomethylation and it linked to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumour supressor genes.</p><p>Decitabine is used to treat Myelodysplastic Syndrome, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia or AML.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can regulate to target in treatment because it can be manipulated once and can have enduring effects because the DNA methyltransferase enzymes during mitosis preserves methyl marks.</p><p>A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming: the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks.</p><p>The sensitive periods of development are the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development.</p><p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because these drugs are going to be used throughout the system until every cell has a potential to be effected by these drugs. Younger patients, effects on sensitive periods (on germ cells) need to be considered. And it would be inadvisable treating patients during sensitive periods because in the sensitive periods occurs a lot of reprogramming.</p><p><br /></p></div>
