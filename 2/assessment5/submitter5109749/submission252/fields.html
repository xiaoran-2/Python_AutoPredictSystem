    <div class="field-value">CpG islands occurring before promoter regions for specific genes in the genome DNA are ordinarily, in healthy tissue, hypomethylated. Methylation at CpG islands acts therefore to silence certain genes, preventing expression. Hypermethylation of CpGI's occurs in many cancers, and can silence tumour suppressor genes, leading to the increased possibility of cancer developing.<br /><br /> Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are ordinarily hypermethyated, stabilising the genome and reducing the chance of errors occurring on cell division. Areas that are not being actively expressed are compacted and shut down, protecting them from abnormal transcription and changes. In cancer these are often hypomethylated, leading to insertions, deletions and translocations within the genome and mitotically heritable genetic abnormalities. <br /><br />These changes, both intergenic and at CpG islands, can lead to altered gene expression, potentially affecting cell growth, angiogenesis or programmed death of cells etc. This can cause rapid and unopposed growth of cancerous tissue, promoting metastasis and invasion of healthy tissue.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 is an imprinted gene, with the paternal allele active and maternal inactive. The mechanism of this is that in the maternal allele the insulator between Igf2 promoter and enhancers is hypomethylated, which prevent expression of the allele. The paternal insulator is methylated, allowing the enhancer to turn on the Igf promoter. Igf2 is therefore expressed from the paternal but not maternal allele.<br />Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted, with both alleles being methylated of Igf2 and therefore increased expression on Igf, which acts as an oncogene. H19 is another imprinted gene, normally expressing only the maternal allele and likewise imprinting disruption can lead to increased expression.<br />Both genes have roles in embryonic growth, where both alleles are expressed prior to one being silenced. It is likely that this facilitation of growth and cell division is what drives the cancerous change. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA Demethylating agent, and is licensed to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. As the CpG islands are hypermethylated that precede promoters of tumour suppressing genes, these are silenced, removing one of the checks and balances that reduce the possibility of development of cancers. Demethylating agents can reverse some of this hypermethylation and re-activate the tumour suppressor genes. This can help to re-establish the normal system of cell death etc.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altered methylation in a cell's DNA is mitotically heritable, therefore being passed to all daughter cells. Sensitive periods for the genome in terms of epigenetics are times when epigenetic marks are being laid down and are most susceptible to disruption. These periods are in early embryonic development, notably gastrulation, and gametogenesis. In the former case imprinting is being established and marks laid down for cell differentiation. Errors here will have most consequences for the developing cell line.<br /><br />Patients need to avoid unnecessary medication in pregnancy, the key period being the first trimester. Organogenesis is occurring and errors may occur that result in foetal abnormalities or cancers. We have been aware of the importance of avoiding medication and environmental hazards at this period for many years, however it is only recently that the importance of epigenetics in this process has been apparent. The examples of Thalidomide causing meromelia and Tetracyclines causing dental abnormalities are illustrations of drugs that may affect the developing foetus.</div>
