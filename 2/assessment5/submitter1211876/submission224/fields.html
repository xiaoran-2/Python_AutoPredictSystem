    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During normal DNA there is hypomethylation at CpG islands and
the introns, intergenic region and the repetitive elements are methylated. </p>

<p>In cancer, DNA methylation at CpG islands becomes more dense
(Hypermethylation). The sets of CpG islands will differ according to tumour
type.</p>

<p>This may be related to the silencing of tumour suppresor
genes and it's mitotically heritable. This would prove to contribute to the
development of cancer and it would be one of the hits proposed by Knudson to be
needed to develope a cancer. Being that's mitotically heritable it's very
effective to silence tumour suppressor genes, because evidently daughter cells
will also have the epimutation.</p>

<p>At the same time the methylation of intergenic regions and
repetitive elements allows to keep the genomic stability. during cancer is frequent
to see hypomethylation of these areas leading to illegitimate recombination
between repeats, activation of repeats and of transposons, also the activation
of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes can happen. All of
this changes taken together lead to genomic instability, expressed in
deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions.</p>



<p>Some cancers are driven by chromosomal instability, in these
cancers the disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive
elements contributes to cancer.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal methylation of the paternal allele inactivates h19,
because there is a Imprint Control Region (ICR) at the promoter of H19 that's
hypermethylated. this in turn promotes the expression of Igf2 thanks to the
action of the enhancers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile lgf2 is inactive in the maternal line and H19 is active
because the ICR is not methylated and this leads CTCF to bind to the area,
making the enhancers have an effect on H19 and not on Igf2. </p>

<p>On Wilm's tumour we lose the imprinting and end up with the
ICR being methylated on both alleles and this leads to an overexpression of Igf2,
this will in turn have a growth promoting effect which is one of the hallmarks
of cancer, in specific observed in Wilm's tumour. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a demethylating agent,
that means it reduces the amount of methyl groups present in the DNA, therefore
affecting the dna wide hypomethylation that affects the tumours  driven by tumour suppresor hypermethylation.</span></p>

<p>The anti-tumour effect would be
expected to be thanks to the reactivation of the tumour suppressors in the DNA.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">

<p class="MsoNormal">Drugs that alter the epigenetic state of the DNA will have
effects after the conclusion of the treatment because the changes to the
methylation will persevere and will be inherited to the daughter cells. Especially
sensitive periods in this regard would be those when the epigenetic marks are
being rewritten, specifically during pregnancy in the developing embryo when
the epigenetic marks are erased to restore pluripotency and then later reestablished.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Treating patients during this periods would seriously harm
the epigenome in a developing embryo, possibly leading to general genome
instability (if a demethylating agent is used) or to tumour suppressor
hypermethylation (if a histone-deacetylase inhibitor), among other possible
outcomes related to inadequate manipulation of the epigenome that would very
possibly lead to the death of the embryo.</p>
