    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal
cell CpG islands are not usually methylated, except for X-inactivation,
imprinted genes or dynamic methylation for various cell types. In cancer it is
common to see a hypermethylation on some CpG islands, especial islands that
precedes regions for tumor suppressor genes. The methylation of tumor
suppressor genes makes the cell more vulnerable for tumors.</p><p>Besides tumor suppressor genes, promotor areas for DNA repair genes may also be methylated, increasing the risk for mutations.</p>

<p>Oncogenes
are normally methylated (inactivated) as they can cause the cell to proliferate
indefinitely. In cancer oncogenes are more epigenetically activated. This
combined with the methlyation of tumor suppressor genes and methylated repair genes makes it easy for the
cell to proliferate. In fact, in cancer there will be a strong selection for
cells with suppressed tumor suppressor genes and activated oncogenes, as they
have a higher survival rate.</p>

<p>Most
intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated to maintain
genomic stability and stop deletions, insertions and duplications. The
methylation of intergenic regions also has an important role in silencing
cryptic transcription. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements
tends to be demethylated. Without the methylation of repetitive elements they could
be inserted inside another gene and either damage that gene or act as a strong
promoter to activate nearby genes.</p>

<p>Hypomethylation
in intergenic regions can also lead to unstable chromosomes; many types of
cancer are associated with demethylation of the region around the centromere,
which could lead to chromosomal rearrangements.</p><p>These
mutations and changes in gene expression increase the risk for cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the
H19/Igf2 cluster the imprinting control region and the H19 promoter is normally
methylated on the paternal allele but unmethylated on the maternal allele.</p>

<p>On the
maternal allele, the downstream enhancers will act on the H19 promoter but the
IGF2 will be silenced because an insulator protein (CTCF) is able to bind to
the imprinting control region (hence H19 will be expressed but not IGF2).</p>

<p><span>On the
paternal allele the imprinting control region and the H19 gene are methylated.
(The H19 gene becomes methylated because of methylation spreading from the
nearby control region).   In the paternal
allele the enhancers will instead activate IGF2 (i.e. IGF2 is expressed but not
the H19).</span></p>

<p><span>In Wilm’s
tumour both alleles displays a paternal epigenotype i.e. the both alleles
express IGF2 which leads to an overexpression of IGF2 in the cell. As IGF2 is
growth promoting gene the double dose of IGF2 contributes to the accelerated
growth as seen in cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine  belongs to the group of DNMT inhibitors (DNMTI).
Decitabine  hinders DNMT to react on DNA
and in this way hypomethylates the DNA.  This
is done during the S-phase, when the DNA is replicated (during cell division). The
drug probably works by demethylating tumor suppressor genes that will help to
induce apoptosis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA
methylation is mitotical inheritable. If a drug changes the methylation
pattern, all subsequent daughter cell will inherit the same methylation
pattern. It is plausible that the demethylaton drug removes blockage from genes
responsible for apoptosis, thereby helping chemotherapy.</p>

<p>Sensitive
periods are periods with large epigenetic reprogramming. If something disturbs
this reprogramming there might be epigenetic errors in all or parts of the cell
lines. There are two major sensitive periods: during the germ cell development
in the parents and during the early development of the embryo. These periods
spans from about one month before conception until about embryonic day 15.</p>

<p><span>Treating a
patient with epigenetic drugs during the sensitive periods could alter the
imprinting of the germ cells and interfere with the normal reprogramming of
somatic cell line during differentiation. </span></p></div>
