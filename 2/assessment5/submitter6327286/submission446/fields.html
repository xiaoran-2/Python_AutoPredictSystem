    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation at a CpG island results in
silencing gene expression in that region. In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated, and
the increased methylation results in an increase in gene silencing. The increased gene silencing can contribute to cancer development by silencing genes that
are normally tumor-suppressing. Normally, methylation in intergenic regions and
repetitive elements helps maintain genomic stability by silencing repeats or
ambiguous splice sites. In other words, it prevents transcription of regions
that may be detrimental to transcribe. In cancer, there is genome-wide reduction in
methylation (hypomethylation). Methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive
elements maintains stability, so loss of methylation in these regions leads to
instability, including gene disruptions, transpositions, and transcription of
genes that may be oncogenic.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele for the H19/Igf2 cluster is
methylated, and so these genes are silenced. The maternal H19/Igf2 cluster is not methylated,
and so it is active. If the imprint control region is
hypermethylated, then imprinting is lost, and Igf2 will be overexpressed. Such
Igf2 overexpression is seen in Wilm’s tumor. Loss of imprinting can mean that the developing
cells are producing twice as much Igf2 as they should, which can stimulate cell
growth (e.g. tumors). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor
(DNMTi). Methyltransferases add methyl groups to DNA, and so DNMTi’s
decrease DNA methylation. Decitabine is replication-dependent, so cells
that replicate more (like tumor cells) will be preferentially affected by these
drugs. They permanently bind to DNMTs to prevent methylation that can contribute to cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When methylation patterns are changed, those
changes are passed down to the offspring of that cell. Thus, the change
persists over many generations. A sensitive period is a time during
development when epigenetic markers are removed between the generations in
order to restore totipotency in the developing organism so that it can undergo
normal development. Sensitive periods include early development
(pre-implantation) and development of primordial germ cells (later, gametes). Primarily because altering the epigenome during
these periods would have global effects that would be fatal to a developing
organism or severely detrimental to offspring derived from germ cells that had
been altered during formation. </p></div>
