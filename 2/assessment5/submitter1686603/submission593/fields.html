    <h1>Submission 593 from Anon (session_user_id: 1f744989242833303d55052140cca2f9dae15f0c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can occur in CpG islands and intergenic regions and repetitive elements. <br />CpG islands are normally unmethylated in order to preserve expression of the following gene(since CpG islands are commonly found in the promoter region of genes).Studies have shown that in cancer the CpG islands are hypermethylated leading to the of silencing tumor supressor genes and allowing cancer to develop.<br /><br /> Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated in order to preserve genome stability. Hypomethylation, found in cancer, leads to genomic instability, translated into abnormal karyotype ( occurance of deletions, insertions and translocations), activation of repeats and transpositions, disruption to neighbouring genes.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation blocks CTCF protein from binding and without CTCF the methylation will spread to h19 promoter for silencing(on the maternal allele) and to the igf2 enhancers for expression(on the paternal allele). The overexpression of igf2 will lead to developement of Wilms tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an DNA-demethylating agent. Decitabine lowers methylation of<span> BRD4 gene which leads to the blocking of the </span>myc gene which<span> encodes a transcription factor. Since tumours are usually hypermethylated, decitabine may have an antitumor effect.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">This is possible because epigenetic phenomena such as DNA methylations are mitotically inheritable, thus making the effect long lasting.<br />A sensitive period is an interval of time in which drugs that target the epigenetic machinery should be avoided such as pregnancy. </div>
