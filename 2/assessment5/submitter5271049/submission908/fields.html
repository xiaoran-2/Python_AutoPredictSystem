    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG
islands are often associated with promoter regions and are unmethylated to
allow the correct expression of genes. Site-specific CpG islands often become
hypermethylated in association with cancers. Hypermethylation contributes to
tumourgenesis by silencing tumour suppressor genes and other classes of genes
such as transcription factors and DNA repair genes. Sites of DNA methylation are
common in intergenic regions and repetitive elements to increase chromosomal
stability and silencing of non-coding DNA and transposable elements. Many
cancers are associated with genome-wide hypomethylation, especially in repeat elements,
intergenic regions and introns. This leads to aberrant activation of genes and
non-coding regions through a variety of mechanisms that contribute to cancer
development and progression.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19
and Igf2 genes control growth and body composition. The genes are expressed in
a parent of origin manner under the control of imprinting control regions (ICR).
In general H19 has a growth restraining effect and Igf2 has a growth promoting
effect. Normally, unmethylation of H19/Igf2 ICR on the maternal allele allows
binding of CTCF which blocks transcription of Igf2 and activates H19,
inhibiting growth. On the paternal allele H19/Igf2 ICR methylation activates
Igf2 transcription and silences H19. In tumours with a loss of imprinting the
maternal allele reverses to a paternal epigenotype with a paternal pattern of
methylation of the H19 promoter. Igf2 is expressed and H19 is not expressed
leading to expression of both alleles of the Igf2 gene and a double dose of
Igf2 mRNA. This causes increased cell growth and is associated with cancer of the kidneys (Wilms' tumour).<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) used to treat myelodysplastic
syndrome which has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. Decitabine is a
cytosine nucleoside analog and is incorporated into DNA, inhibiting further DNA
methylation. This is probably through the trapping of methyl transferases at
sites of nucleoside incorporation which depletes enzymatic activity resulting
in heritable demethylation of DNA. As a consequence, aberrantly silences genes
such as tumour suppressor genes can be reactivated and expressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many
epigenetic drugs are unspecific and as such every cell in the body can
potentially be affected. Altering the DNA methylation state of the genome can
cause chromosome instability and even promote malignant transformations of
genes. Sensitive periods are times or stages when, in respect to epigenetics;
the epigenome is more responsive to certain stimuli. For example, in human
development sensitive periods are during epigenetic reprogramming
(pre-implantation and primordial germ-cell development) and when epigenetic marks
can be established (e.g. gametogenesis). This use of epigenetic treatments
during these periods should be avoided to prevent disruptions to normal
epigenetic re-programming and establishment.</p></div>
