    <div class="field-value"><strong>CpG Islands (CGIs) DNA Methylation</strong><br />CpG islands are hypomethylated in normal cells, that is, there is no CpG methylation in general, in these locations. By contrast, in cancer cells, the CgP islands are hypermethylated. They aren't all methylated, but they are more methylated in general, than normal cells. Also, the degree and location of methylation differs by tumor genotype.<br />CGIs Methylation acts to silence tumor suppresor genes. As DNA Methylation is mitotically heritable, this is "the perfect" place for cancer to disturb since the process is further sustained by the normal functioning of the organism.<br /><br /><strong>DNA Methylation at Intergenic Regions</strong><br />The genome is normally methylated at the repetitive elements, intergenic region as well as introns of genes. In contrast, in cancer we observe a hypomethylation of all these regions.<br />In normal cells, methylation at repeats and intergenic regions promotes genome stability. It ensures that no "illegitimate" recombinations happen, no chromosomes are lost/gained, etc. As a consequence, the hypomethylation of these regions in cancer, promots genome instability (deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Overview</strong><br />One common observation with cancer cells is that they are associated with loss of imprinting. One reason may be that these genes are often associated with growth control, something that cancer seeks to alter. The alteration of DNA Methylation at ICRs (which can be either hyper- or hypomethylation) thus can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and over expression of growth promoting genes.<br /><br /><strong>H19/Igf2 example</strong><br />On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated so CTCF does NOT bind to it and the enhancers can act on Igf2 and thus Igf2 is expressed.<br />On the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated, CTCF insulator DOES bind to it and the enhancers act on H19 and thus the Igf2 is silenced.<br />Now in cancer, with loss of imprinting, you have hypermethylation (in this particular case, but remember that we can have hypomethylation for ICRs in other cases) at the ICR (on the maternal allele as well) which leads to Igf2 being expresses on both alleles and resulting in a double dose. This is associated with Wilm's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.<br />It hypomethylates the DNA by inhibiting the DNA methyltransferase.<br />According to the prescribing information from the producer, the mechanism of action is as follows: it is believed that Decitabine exerts its anti-neoplastic effect after phosphorylation and incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing DNA hypomethylation and cellular differentiation or apoptosis.<br /><br />References:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">http://www.economist.com/node/21552168</a><br /></li><li><a href="http://www.dacogen.com/">http://www.dacogen.com/</a><br /></li><li><a href="http://www.dacogen.com/content/documents/Dacogen_PI.pdf" title="Link: http://www.dacogen.com/content/documents/Dacogen_PI.pdf">http://www.dacogen.com/content/documents/Dacogen_PI.pdf</a><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span><br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and as such, it (the epigenetic changes associated with it) can be passed further, to daughter cells, until they are actively erased.<br />A sensitive period is a period in the life of the cells they they are subsceptible to epigenetic changes/reprogramming such as during pre-implantation as well as germ cell development. During such periods, because of the specific mechanism of action of the drug would be unadvisable to treat patients with it, as to not interfere with normal cell development in an adverse way. This is also the recommendation from the producer (1) as can be see in section 5.2 "Use in pregnancy".<br /><ol><li><a href="http://www.dacogen.com/content/documents/Dacogen_PI.pdf" title="Link: http://www.dacogen.com/content/documents/Dacogen_PI.pdf">http://www.dacogen.com/content/documents/Dacogen_PI.pdf</a></li></ol></div>
