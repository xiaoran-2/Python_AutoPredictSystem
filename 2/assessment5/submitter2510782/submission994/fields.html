    <div class="field-value">In mammals, DNA methylation at CpG islands is required for proper embryogenesis and development, for sustaining chromosomal stability, telomere length, and predetermined gene expression states. It is essential for life. CpG islands are usually not methylated in normal cells, but in those that are, they serve to silence gene expression through several mechanisms primarily through the formation of a repressive chromatin structure and secondarily by prohibiting transcription factor binding, one example being X inactivation. In general however CpG islands are not methylated in normal cells. In most cancer cells however, CpG islands methylation tend to increase. Since most of these CpG islands tend to be located at the promoters of tumor supressor genes, hypermethylation of CpG islands in these cells silences these surpressor genes, giving them a selective advantage over normal cells,  allowing them to divide more rapidly, which is one of the hallmark of cancer cells. In some cases however, the opposite effect is seen, as hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters call also help induce cancer by activating oncogenes. <br /><br />In contrast to CpG islands, Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells  tend to be methylated, their primary function being to maintain genomic integrity by preventing deletions, translocations and insertions as well as silencing cryptic transcription start sites at intergenic regions as well as preventing transpositions, illegitimate recombinations and avoiding transcriptional interference at strong promoters at repetitive elements.  In cancers cells, both intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated resulting in genomic instability due to illegitimate deletions, translocations, insertions, transpositions, recombinations and the activation of cryptic promoters which result in disruption to neighboring genes. These hypomethylation can be brought about through passive(loss of DNMT1 function) as well as active enzymatic removal(involving TET proteins, etc.) that are  induced in cancer cells. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Imprint Control Region is unmethylated in the maternal allele. When its unmethylated CTCF binds its insulator element, which means that the enhancers will bind on H19 and not Igf2 which means that Igf2 will not be expressed. On the paternal allele the ICR's are methylated, preventing CTCF from binding its insulator element, with spreading of methylation to the H19 preventing the enhancers from binding H19  and allowing the enhancers to bind to Igf2 instead resulting in its expression. <br /><br />However with loss of imprinting, you have hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele as well, resulting in the overexpession(both from paternal and maternal alleles) of the Ifg2 growth promoting gene, which is associated with Wilm's tumor. Basically the overexpression of these growth promoting genes is the reason that a cancerous growth has occurred, these being the direct result of the disruption of impringting in the ICR. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the  DNMT(DNMethyl Transferase) Inhibitors class. They are nucleoside analogues that  bind irreversibly to the DNMT enzyme when the cell is replicating, resulting in DNA demethylation. Since they are replication dependent, they are more likely to affect rapidly replicating cells like tumor cells possibly resulting in the demethylation of tumor suppressor genes(methylation marks usually found in their promoters are inhibitory and their removal will result in the expression of these tumor supression genes) and allowing these genes to suppress the growth of the tumor. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, epigenetic changes made by these drugs can be passed on to succeeding daughter or granddaughter cells. These is especially true during sensitive periods of epigenetic development, which are periods when there is active remodeling(removal and laying down of epigenetic marks), where they are most sensitive to enviromental effects like from drugs for instance. These sensitve periods are from primordial germ cell development up to the production of mature egg and sperm and the second is from the preimplantation and early postimplantation period during early embryonic development.  It is therefore advisable to proceed with caution during these sensitive periods especially in the case of younger patients where the effect on germ cells need to be considered as the active remodeling of these epigenetic marks can be disrupted which can have long term consequences not only on the individuals concerned  but also in their progeny because of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. <br /></div>
