    <h1>Submission 246 from Anon (session_user_id: b03070d2a8a473f0c0c2784c7b842a4252bf49c6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands hypermethylation frequently occurs in cancer cells causing silencing of tumour supressor genes. Epigeneticists and clinical researchers have realized that these changes can be slowed or reversed in some cases by using certain drugs. These epigenetic drugs are already being used for treatments in myelodysplastic syndromes (precursors of leukemias).</p><p>Decitabine is one of these drugs.  It is a hypomethylating agent which hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Thus in myelodysplasias, the treatment are linked with activation of promoter of tumor suppressor genes and the slow growth of cancer cells. Moreover these changes in epigenetic status of cancer cells are also heritable by daughter cells which would reduce the recurrence of tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Most
imprinted genes are associated with growth. For this reason, alteration in DNA
methylation at imprinting control regions (IRCs) in cancer cells (either
hypo-or hypermethylation) can results in no expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of
growth promoting genes.</p><p>In the case
of  imprinted cluster H19/Igf2, the ICR
of the paternal allele is methylated but the mother. There is a
paternal imprinting. When this ICR is unmethylated, it is bound by a protein
called CTCF that is able to insulate Igf2 
from their enhancers. But these enhancers  also will be able to alter the expression of
H19 that ocurrs in this case. For the paternal allele when the IRC is
methylated CTCF protein can not bind to it. Thus enhancers, which have a
preference for Igf2, promote the expression of this gene.</p><p>



</p><p>In Wilm's
Tumour is found a hypermethylation in the maternal allele at ICR. In this way,
the Igf2 /H19 balance of the expression breaks. Methylation of both paternal
and maternal ICR  leads to H19 silence
and produces a double dose of Igf2. Igf2 is a growth factor involved in development and growth. Its
overexpression provide a growth and
survival advantage to malignant cells and resistance to chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA of
normal mammalian cells are hypomethylated at CpG islands . These regions often
are promoters of genes, as tumour suppressor genes.  Different cell types have different types of
methylation and maintain this condition during life. In tumor cells can occur
an abnormal methylation in promoters of tumor suppressor genes that may become
silenced. This hypermethylation is mitotically heritable and sometimes gives
them a competitive advantage over normal cells because abnormal cells divide
quickly and the tumour grows.</p><p>

</p><p>Moreover,
most of the genome in normal cells is formed by intergenic intervals or
repetitive elements  that are methylated
in general and whose function is to maintain genomic stability. What happens in
cancer cells is that these regions are less methylated than normal. The
consequence of this hypomethylation in these cancer cells have abnormal
karyotypes (deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in
chromosomes).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration in the methylation state genome frequently occurs in tumor cells and this state is inherited by daughter cells through DNA methyltransferase during mitosis. Furthermore, epimutation provide a competitive advantage to cancer cells. The epigenetic treatments tend to repair these cancer cell conditions which will be also inherited.</p><p>The sensitive period in early development is when the genetic reprogramming where epigenetic marks are cleared happens. There are two waves of reprogramming: the preimplantation period and the development of primordial germ cells. In these periods the majority of DNA methylation and histone marks  are removed. Therefore, it would be inadvisable to prescribe epigenetic treatments for pregnant women and during the formation of gametes (male and female). </p></div>
