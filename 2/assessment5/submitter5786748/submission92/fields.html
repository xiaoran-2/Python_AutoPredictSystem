    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells DNA methylation patterns
are altered in a way that result in loss of expression of tumor repressing
genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes. This is achieved by both, hypo
or hypermethylation of different regions of the genome. </p>

<p>CpG islands are found in about 60% of
promoters and, in normal cells, are usually hypomethylated. In general,
methylation in the promoters of genes inversely correlates with gene
expression. In cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, and
this is especially true for tumor suppressor genes. This hypermethylation of
CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes will silence these genes
in favor of the tumor progression and as DNA methylation is mitotically heritable
this will be maintained through replication. </p>

<p><span>Repetitive elements, intergenic regions and
introns are usually hypermethylated which may help to a correct expression of
the gene without transcriptional noise, antisense transcription or incorrect
alternative start or splicing. In cancer cells, normally methylated regions
such as repetitive regions, CpG poor promoters or imprinting control regions tend
to be hypomethylated. In general, this genome-wide hypomethylation seen in
cancer causes genomic instability. Activation of regions such as repeats can
cause translocations or erroneous recombination (due to loss of
heterochromatin), insertions, deletions, activation of genes leading to transcriptional
aberrations. In addition, hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can result in
activation of oncogenes. </span></p><p><span>All the
described above can be said in general, but how and which of these processes
occur, which genes are affected and which process is more predominant is specific
on the type of cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A common feature on cancer cells is the
loss of imprinting, that is, genes that should be have monoallelic parent of
origin specific expression can be both silenced or expressed disrupting the
normal expression pattern. This is especially important as lots of imprinted
genes are involved in cellular growth. In cancer, imprint controlled regions
can be hypo or hypermethylated depending on the function of the genes in the particular
region studied. </p>

<p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint
controlled region is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the
maternal allele. When it is unmethylated CTCF binds to the unmethylated region
insulating Igf2 impeding its expression activating the expression of H19. In
the paternal allele the lack of binding of the insulator CTCF will lead to the
expression of Igf2 and the silencing of H19. </p>

<p>In Wilm´s tumor, there is hypermetilation
of the imprint controlled region on the maternal allele. This loss of
imprinting will lead to have expression of Igf2 from both alleles. Igf2 is
growth promoting and is associated with Wilm´s tumor. </p>

<p><span>Loss of imprinting is observed in different
ICRs on different cancer types and is a very early event in tumorigenesis
observed even in preneoplastic tissues. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, is
a nucleoside analog that binds irreversibly to DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) inhibiting
their activity. Decitabine gets incorporated in the DNA upon replication and when
DNMT1 binds to copy the methylation to the daughter strands the irreversibly
bond formed impedes its release and therefore its correct activity. All this
implies that the activity of this drug is division dependent, so cancer cells
will be more severely affected.</p>

<p>These DNMTs
inhibitor drugs can be efficient in cancer types that depend on CpG island
hypermethylation on tumor suppressing genes, and therefore inactivation of such
genes, to develop. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation, like in general epigenetic changes,
is mitotically inheritable, that is these epigenetic alterations are maintained
when the cells divide. </p>

<p><span>A sensitive period is defined as a period during development
where epigenetic marks are being established, when there is active remodeling
of epigenetic marks. This epigenetic reprogramming occurs mainly in germ cell
development and pre-implantation development, but also happens in cellular differentiation
to produce particular cell types. When epigenetic drugs are administered, they
can reach any cell in the organism, they have a systemic effect, which means
that every cell, not only cancer cells, can be potential targets for the drug.
So they should not be used, or be used cautiously, in patients in sensitive
periods, such as children, pregnant women, etc. The changes induced by these
drugs will be inherited after cell division causing the modification to spread,
so if changes are produced in healthy cells subjected to epigenetic reprogramming
they can lead to unwanted side-effects.  </span></p></div>
