    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">Normally DNA at CpG islands is unmethylated. It helps to maintain genomic stability and is associated with active gene expression, however in cancer cells DNA at CpG islands and CpG island shores found to be hypermethylated and therefore associated with silence of tumour suppressor genes. DNA hypermethylation is mitoticaly heritable, locus specific and progresses with time (increases with age ).Unlike GpG islands and they shores, intragenic regions and reppetitive elements in normal cells are methlated to avoid genomic instability. In cancer cells where the intergenic regions and reppetitive elements are hypomethylated genomic stability is disrupted. Hypomethylated intragenic regions causes abnormal sites deletions, incersions or reciprocal translocations. Activation of repeats causes illegitimate recombination, transposition or transcriptional interferance from strong promoters. It disrupts normal cell development.That might cause number of human diseases, many of them different type of cancers. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Monoallelic gene expresion - when only one of two alleles is expressed. It is based on parent of origin of the allele. In H19/lgf2 cluster case in a normal cell paternal allele DNA is methylated at imprint control region (ICR). DNA methylation  at ICR blocks binding of CTFC and allows methylation to spread to H19 promoter to silence it. With silenced H19 enhancers are able to acsess lgf2 gene and activate it.  Maternal allele in normal cell has unmethylated ICR, which now can bind with CTFC insulator protein. This protein insulates lgf2 from the downstream enhancers and it is no longer expressed. <br />In Wlim's tumour  both maternal and paternal alleles are expressed. It is do to methylation in both ICRs. These alterations in DNA methylation can result loss of expression of growth restricting genes, over expression of growth promoting genes. It is often seen in pri-neoplastic tissue.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNMT inhibitors class. These inhibitors demethlylase DNA. They are nucleotide analogues. DNMTi gets incorporated into DNA apon replication and once DNA metaltransferies binds it is irreversable. This means that these inhibitors are replication dependent. The more cell replicates the more effected it will be. Although Decitabine effects all genome,  it is known that cancer cells divides much more rapidly then normal cells, so the drug will effect them more.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome  during sensitive periods. There is two sensitive periods: early development (from gametes to epiblast )  and germ cell development ( boys from around 9 -12 years, girls around 8-10 years ) During these periods epigenetic marks are cleared and reseted, or left untouched. Drugs like <span>Decitabine might disrupted normal cell reprogramming. </span>If there is DNA methylation changes at that time it will alter the epigenome of next generations and generations after that or even more. The effects are barely known, so treatment like that would be inadvisable.</div>
