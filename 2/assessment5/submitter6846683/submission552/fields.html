    <div class="field-value">Cancer cells are in general globally hypomethylated, but specific loci such as CpG islands may be hypermethylated.  <br />CpG islands in the normal cell are generally hypomethylated to allow normal gene transcription to take place in active genes.  In cancer, the CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated.  CpG islands often occur in the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes.  If DNA methylation occurs in these regions the tumour suppressor genes are not expressed (they are functionally silenced) and the cell is one step closer in the multistep process to become a cancer cell.  <br />In a normal cell the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated to help maintain stability of the genome.  In cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally hypomethylated.  This leads to genomic instability with an increased risk for illegitimate recombination of transposons, reciprocal translocations, deletions and insertions which may inactive tumour suppressor genes or may enhance the activity of proto-oncogenes (which then become oncogenes).  Oncogenes may for example be formed when translocations cause a proto-oncogene to be placed adjacent to a strong promoter or a gene that is constantly and strongly expressed in that cell type.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer in the H19/Igf2 cluster in the following way.  In a normal cell, the paternal allele at the imprint control region is methylated which prevents the insulator element, CTCF from binding.  The downstream enhancers can freely act on Igf2, leading to expression of Igf2.  In contrast, in the normal cell, the maternal allele is unmethylated.  CTCF can now bind which insulates the enhancers from the Igf2 gene.  The enhancers act on H19 but Igf2 is not expressed.  In Wilm's tumour the maternal allele, like the paternal allele, is methylated at the imprint control region and Igf2 is not insulated from the effect of the enhancers and is therefore expressed.  Igf2 is expressed in a double dose in the cell which promotes growth. This is an early event in many tumours and is already seen in preneoplastic tissues.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi).  Decitabine is FDA approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia.  DNA is demethylated by the action of this drug.  Decatibine works by being a nucleoside analogue.  It is built into the DNA molecule during replication.  It binds irreversibly to the enzyme DNA methyltransferase, thereby inhibiting its action and this leads to demethylation of DNA. Because this drug is replication dependent, cancer cells (which are usually more mitotically active than normal cells) are more severely affected.  Although the exact mechanism of the anti-tumour effect is unclear, one way in which it may have anti-tumour effect is by reversing hypermethylation at CpG islands, thereby switching tumour gene suppressor genes on again.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable epigenetic mark through the action of DNMT1 which means that daughter cells will inherit hyper or hypomethylation of DNA at specific sites in the genome.  Once it has been removed though, by a drug for example,  it does not return.  This may mean that by altering the epigenetic state of a cancer cell you may have altered the growth of that cell without killing the cell.  Unfortunately normal cells may also be affected by epigenetic drugs because epigenetic control plays a critical role in all tissue types.  The epigenetic machinery is most vulnerable to environmental factors during specific sensitive periods which are periods when the epigenetic marks are actively removed and reestablished. These sensitive periods are generally during early embryonal development (preimplantation) and during primordial germ cell development. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because of the risk of altering critical epigenetic processes that are vital to the survival of normal cells, such as developing germ cells, and increasing the risk for side effects. </div>
