    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation is to silence DNA repeats, intergenic sequence and intragenic introns. In addition, it is necessary in case of imprint control region in which the gene from one allele is only only expressed. <br />However, in case of cancer, a genome wide hypomethylation and specific locus hyper methylation occurs (in CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes).<br />DNA methylation can contribute to cancer because it leads to gene silencing. Therefore, if a tumor suppressor gene become methylated, it become inactive, or if a growth promoter gene (oncogene) that is normally methylated become unmethylated. Both will lead to uncontrolled growth and cancer.  <br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements ensures genomic stability and integrity. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements have strong promoters which may interfere with the normal expression of nearby genes or may even cause the expression of genes when they are not supposed to. Also, repetitive element tend to replicate themselves and paste themselves in different parts of the genome. So, silencing of the repetitive elements is essential to prevent gene disruptions and chromosomal translocation.<br />.<br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In case of maternal allele, the imprinted control region is hyopmethylated allowing the CTCF to bind which in turn prevent the enhancers from acting upon the Igf2 gene. So, instead the act on the H19 gene. Therefore, the H19 gen is actively expressed while Igf2 gene is not <br />on the other hand.<br />In case of the paternal allele the imprinted control region is hyper methylated prevent the CTCF  from binding which in turn allow the enhancers to activate the Igf2 gene while the H19 gene remains inactive. <br />In Wilm's tumor, the imprinted control region in the  maternal allele is abnormally hypermethylated like the paternal allele. This leads to over expression of the Igf2 gene from both allele and no expression of the H19 gene. The Igf2 gene is a growth promoting gene. Therefore, overexpression of the gene result in cancer</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine  is a DNA demethylating agent so it restores the activity of the inactive methylated tumor suppressor gene. Also, according to chemocare.com, Decitabine belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites that are similar to normal metabolites but have a cytotoxic effect when incorporated in the cellular metabolism of the cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span> DNA methylation can have enduring effect because it is mitotically heritable.</span><br />A sensitive period is the period in which the epigenome is susceptible to alteration due to the environment. This occurs during the embryonic development and the first 2 years of life. However, this is true when talking about big changes in the epigenome, but in cancer only one change may be enough to cause cancer.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because at this time extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs. Therefore, the drug may disrupt this process.<br /><br /></div>
