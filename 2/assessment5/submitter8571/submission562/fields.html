    <h1>Submission 562 from Anon (session_user_id: 41366c30528b7a09d810b22ad63e37ff7ac332d2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is molecular chemically similar to cytidine nucleoside molecule. It is known by its trademark name Dacogen, produced by a Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai.  It is a DNA-demethylating agent in the same family with azacitidline. Sometimes they are also called hypomethylating agents. In simple words, it means that decitabine reduces the chances of methyl groups to attach to DNA. <p>

In cancer-cell there is a genome-wide DNA lack of mythylation (hypomethylation) but at some places of genome that are responsible for activation of tumor suppressor genes there is extra methylation (hypermethylation). Hypermetylation at these critical places turns off the related genes. Even if Decitabine reduces methylation none-specifically to tumor suppressor gene promoters, it is still beneficial because it has a chance to “turn on” again the cell’s own mechanisms (genes) to control cancer and this can me mitotically inherited by daughter cells (if the cell is not killed in the process).

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can be mitotically inherited. In other words when a cell divides in two, her two daughter-cells not only have the same genes as the mother-cell has but also share the same methylation pattern that control expression of these genes. Therefore, if the methylation pattern is altered in the mother-cell via drug intervention this alteration can be preserved in the future cell generations that would be alive by the time of the next treatment with a different drug.<p>
   
There are periods when methylation pattern is not preserved during mitosis but reprogrammed (cleared and rebuild anew). These periods are called sensitive periods. One is during an earlier development and the other is during PGC (primordial germ cell) development. This is a highly tuned process with a complicated intra cellular orchestration. Paternal and maternal epigenetic marks are cleared and rebuilt at different rates. Drugs that act as hypo- or hyper-methylation agents will interfere this reprogramming with unpredictable but almost certainly harmful effects on fetus or gametes. That is why Eisai warns regarding its product: “Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with DACOGEN and for 1 month following completion of treatment.”

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands are usually not methylated. Many of them are associated with the gene promoters. Methylation of the CpG islands in the promoter may inhibit gene expression. In cancer cells the methylation of the CpG islands is higher and this leads to deactivation of the certain genes. Selective pressure on the cell level favors deactivation of the tumor suppression genes. <p>

On the other hand methylation of the itergenic regions and repetitive elements in the normal cells is high. This methylation prevents recombination errors and expression of the repetitive elements. If this pattern of methylation is altered then there is a higher risk of mutation during mitosis. In most cases such mutations probably will not be harmful since they will either bring the cell to apoptosis or be of no significance. In the long run, sooner or later just because of the enormous amount of dividing cells, there will be a mutation favorable to cancer development. That is probably the reason why in cancer cells itergenic and repetitive elements are mythylated much less than in normal cell. Luckily in many cases by the time the cancer grows to the life threatening extent the organism will be dead because of other age related reasons.
