    <div class="field-value"><div>In Cancer , Malignant cells are accompanied by an
overall hypomethylation is associated
with the activation of genes required for invasion and metastasis, via oncogenetics-(quantization
techniques of methylation) and a local hypermethylation (CpG islands)
related to the suppression of tumor suppressor genes
suppressing-path-(techniques for the detection of certain genes CpG<span>) <br /></span><br />In general in a normal cell you find that the CpG islands are hypomethylated, and the intergeneic regions, introns and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. In a cancer cell, as a rule of thumb you observe a reversal in this pattern: CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated, and the latter regions are hypomethylated. For the CpG islands, this leads to problems as tumor suppressor genes may become silenced, allowing the cell to divide more rapidly, outcompete its neighboring cells, and grow into a tumour. For the latter regions, normally hypermethylation at these sites is associated with greater genomic stability, so hypomethylation during cancer leads</div><div>to copying errors such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the chromosomes.<br /><br />The rules that determine which genes are methylated
during the pathogenesis of a particular type of cancer are complex and yet to
be deciphered. However, there are DNA methylation markers that are very
specific and can detect many types of common tumors. These markers could be
very useful in the early diagnosis of cancer. For example, promoter hypermethylation of the
pi-class glutathione S-transferase<span> (GSTP1)
appears a promising diagnostic indicator of prostate cancer.</span><br /><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The absence of any DNA methylation on the silent Igf2 gene
forced us to consider alternative models to explain its imprinting. In fact, it
is the expressed paternal allele of Igf2<span> that is
specifically methylated in two locations: within the gene itself and in its 5′
flank .</span><br />In a cell around the H19/Igf2 locus we ordinarily see the methylation of the paternal allele at the ICR, and no methylation for the maternal allele. The CTCF complex binds to the allele on the maternal strand and the downstream enhancers act on H19 as a result. The CTCF complex does not bind to the paternal allele due to the methyl marks, which leads to silencing of the H19 gene as the enhancers instead drive expression of Igf2. Thus, in a regular cell you observe a normal dose of both H19 from maternal strand, and Igf2 from paternal strand. However, when this ICR becomes hypermethylated, both strands appear to be of paternal origin and get expressed as such. That is, the system gets a double dose of (growth­promoting) Igf2 (as well as no dose of H19). This is associated with Wilm's tumour.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>•Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia it´s a histone-deacetylase inhibitors.Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent<u>.</u> It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase<u>.</u> Experimentally, high doses induce rapid DNA damage and cytotoxicity.Transient exposure of cultured and primary leukemic and epithelial tumor cells to clinically relevant nanomolar doses, without causing immediate cytotoxicity, produce an antitumor "memory"
response, including inhibition of subpopulations of cancer stem-like cells. These effects are accompanied by sustained decreases in genomewide promoter DNA methylation, gene reexpression, and antitumor changes in key cellular regulatory pathways. In case of Decitabine, the anti­tumour effect has been linked to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor supressor genes, induced by the hypothemylation.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is a particularly attractive form of regulation to target in treatments because it can be manipulated once, and enduring effects are ensured as the DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis.<br />These inteventios can interfere with normal functions . There are some evidence that interfere during critical periods.<br />In particular, it would be inadvisable to prescribe these treatments to pregnant mothers (including a few months before conception) as a lot of reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the formation ofgametes (both male and female).</div></div>
