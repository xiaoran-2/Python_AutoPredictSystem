    <h1>Submission 375 from Anon (session_user_id: 7ed2baf009185659a90301d03c7c384cdc5d59ee)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Upon DNA replication hemimethylation occurs
which is responsible for passing on DNA methylation to cell progeny upon cell
division. Thus altering the meythlation status using drugs will have a long
lasting effect on subsequent cells arising from cells affected by the drug at
the time the drug was administered. </p>

<p>A sensitive period is the period where DNA is susceptible
the most to environmental factors that affect the epigenetic state of the cell.
Those are when the tissue is undergoing epigenetic reprogramming. During which
previous epigenetic marks are erased and re-established</p>

<p>In normal development we have two sensitive periods
during primordial germ cell development and in the preimplantaion embryo. However
also different tissues during development or tissue remodeling may go through
similar stages that are tissue specific and that are less extensive than these
two stages</p>

<p><span>The reason why treatment with epigenetic drugs
is un-advisable during these sensitive period because these drugs interfere with
DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling which are required in this sensitive period
to reestablish the normal epigenetic status of the cell. As in these periods most
of the DNA methylation and chromatin packaging will be erased and
reestablished. Which will have tremendous effect on subsequent generation it
also could lead to embryonic lethality and infertility problems.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>It’s an agent that belongs to DNA methyltransferase
inhibitors. It drives DNA hypomethylation. By significantly reducing DNA
methylation it promotes genomic instability and thus blocking protein synthesis
leading to cell death and thus tumor regression</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The paternal allele is
mythelated at the imprint control region, thus allowing enhancers located above
the Igf2/H19cluster to act on Igf2 leading to paternal  monoallelecic expression of igf2. On the
contrary the maternal allele ICR is unmethylated allowing it to associate with
CTCC protein which interferes with enhancer function acting on Igf leading to
silencing of the maternal allele. </span></p>

<p><span>In Wilms tumors there
is either hypermythelation at the ICR of the paternal allele or mythelation of
ICR of the maternal allele(in this case allowing the enhancers above these
clusters to exert their effect on ) in either case there is an increase in the
expression of insulin growth factor to double the origin amout which as the
name implies enhances growth and promote cellular proliferation. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA mythelation and de-methylation at CpG
islands is associated with downstream effects on the chromatin structure of the
DNA rendering it inaccessible for the RNA polemerase and activator proteins,
thus leading to significantly reduced gene expression and silencing. This is
important in normal tissue as mythelation status of DNA at a certain locus is different
in different genes allowing for differential gene expression thus tissue
specialization. however normally CpG islands are hypmethylated.</p>

<p><span>Disruption of DNA mythelation pattern in
cancer cells is usually accompanied by a mutation in one of the enzymes of the
methylation-demythelaion machinery. For example, the mythelation enzyme DNA
mythltransferase (DNMT3) and the demythelaion protein TET (responsible for hydroxylation
of mythelcytosine ). It is important to note that all of these are enzymes
subject to regulatory processes, and any disruption to these regulatory
mechanisms  contributes  to aberrant DNA methylation patter in cancer
cells.</span></p>

<p><span>Disruption to the normal DNA mythelation pattering
in cancer  leads to re-establishment of a
new and the loss of DNA mythelaiton at critical regions of the DNA controlling
tumor suppressor genes and demthylation of sites controlling oncogens..</span></p>

<p>Mythelation ate intergenic regions is
important for maintaing the stability of the genome by silencing transposable
elements. Intergenic regions are also associated with different types of
non-coding RNAs such as pi-RNA and lnc-RNA, those can affect the methylation
status of some gene most importantly imprinted genes</p>

<p><span>In cancer deregulated mythelation pattern at
critical intregenic regions including regions occupied by transposable and repetitive
element. This deregulation increase that risk further mutations by destabilizing
the genome and activating imprinted genes and since these genes regulate the
methylation pattern of other genes it also contribute to an additional
epigenetic irregularties </span></p></div>
