    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are usually located in the promoters of the genes and most of the time they are unmethylated. The DNA methylation of the CpG island silences the gene expression. In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated. Since, they occur in tumor suppressor genes, this hypermethylation will lead to silencing these tumor suppressor genes. <br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated, and this happen in order to maintain genomic integrity. The methylation of the intergenic regions silences cryptic transcriptors start sites or cryptic splice sites. And the methylation and therefore silencing of the repetitive elements prevents transposition and illegitimate recombination. On cancer both intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, leading to genomic instability, since illegitimate recombination can occur as well as activation of the repeats resulting in transposition, among many others abnormalities such as deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting is the monoallelic parent of origin specific expression. In cancer, there is the hypermethylation of imprinting control regions (ICR) leading to expression or silencing from both parental alleles. In the specific case of Igf2, on the paternal allele  the ICR is methylated so Igf2 is expressed. On the contrary, in the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated, resulting in no expression of Igf2.<br />In Wilms Tumor, there is loss of imprinting and hypermethylation of both alleles, i.e. both alleles expresses Igf2, resulting in a double-dose of Igf2 which is a growth promoting gen.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">It is a de novo methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). As the name suggests, it  results in DNA demethylation, This drug is a nucleoside analogue, it binds irreversibly to DNMT after they are incorporated into DNA. Therefore, they are replication dependent. The anti-tumor effect is not specific, it causes demethylation on replication cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Epigenetic changes (such as DNA methylation) are mitotically inheritable, can be passed to daughter cell and subsequently to granddaughter cell and so on.Sensitive periods are periods of reprogramming of the epigenetic markers; they are mainly two: germ cell development and pre-implantion embryonic development. Treating patients in these periods should be avoided in order not to disrupt the whole epigenetic machinery. All epigenetic treatments have the potential to affect each and every cell of our body, therefore attention must be paid in using these therapies for younger patients, in whom the effects on germ cells need to be considered.</span></div>
