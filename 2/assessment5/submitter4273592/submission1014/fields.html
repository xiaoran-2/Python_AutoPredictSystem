    <h1>Submission 1014 from Anon (session_user_id: 31722acb109acf7f07d3b8f7c3cacfc4a58d4a4b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have lasting effects beyond the period of drug treatment because DNA methylation is heritable.  Any changes to DNA methylation will be passed on to the next generation of cells, including any growth of tumor cells.  I would avoid treating patients with such drugs during sensitive periods, which are periods of epigenetic remodeling such as early embryonic development and germ line cell development.  Treating with drugs that alter DNA methylation would be inadvisable because the epigenetic marks set up during these periods, including DNA methylation, are critical for proper development of an embryo and creation of viable gametes that create these embryos.  In embryonic development, the DNA methylation found in the gametes is erased and replaced with the appropriate methylation for development of the proper tissues of the embryo.  In germ cell development, DNA methylation is also erased and replaced with methylation such as imprinting that can mark genes as either maternal or paternal, and this can affect their expression in the future offspring.  Interfering with these processes with these drugs could result in inviable or sub-par gametes or offspring. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, DNA methylation at CpG islands results in silencing of a gene.  CpG islands are often found at the promoter for a gene, and when methylated, that promoter will not initiate gene expression and the gene will be silenced.  Most CpG islands remain unmethylated, but some are appropriately silenced.  In cancer, CpG islands that are normally unmethylated can become methylated, inappropriately silencing genes.  When this occurs at a tumor suppressor gene, overgrowth can result, contributing to causing cancer--one of the "hits" in the Knudson hypothesis.<br /><br />On the contrary, DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is normal.  These areas need to be silenced by methylation in order to have genomic stability.  In cancer, these regions can be hypomethylated.  When this occurs, the genome becomes unstable, resulting in illegitimate recombination at repeats, translocations, insertions, and deletions.  Cryptic promoters can also become active, disrupting nearby genes.  Genomic instability can directly cause cancer, as the alterations can activate oncogenes and deactivate tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br />Hypomethylation at CpG poor promoters can also play a role in cancer.  Some promoters with few CpGs control genes that can contribute to cancer.  Genome-wide hypomethylation is often found in cancer.  When this occurs, these CpG poor promoters can lose their methylation, activating these cancer causing genes--for example,a microRNA can be activated that then attacks (inactivates) a tumor-suppressor, preventing it from suppressing growth, and causing over-growth and therefore cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting (gamete-specific DNA methylation) can control gene expression, specifically allowing differing expression of genes in the same region between maternal and paternal chromosomes.  When this imprinting is improperly altered, the changes in gene expression can contribute to cancer.  At the H19/Igf2 cluster, two genes are involved: Igf2, upstream, and H19, downstream.  Between the two genes is a binding site for an inhibitor, CTCF.  This inhibitor blocks the action of enhancers downstream from H19 that would upregulate Igf2.  On the maternal chromosome, which is not methylated, this is what happens--H19 is expressed, and Igf2 is expressed at a low level.  Alternatively, on the paternal chromosome, H19 is methylated (and not expressed), as is the binding site for CTCF, which blocks binding. This means the enhancers are able to act on Igf2, increasing its expression.  In Wilm's tumor, the maternal chromosome is methylated just like the paternal one.  This means H19 is not expressed from either, and both are producing large amounts of Igf2.  Igf2 is a growth-promoting oncogene.  When over-expressed, as in this situation, it contributes to cancer, such as Wilm's tumor.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor.  It inhitits DNMTs, which are enzymes that methylate the genome.  It is a nucleoside analogue that, when incorporated into the genome, irreversibly binds the DNMT, preventing it from methylating the genome, resulting in a decreased level of methylation in new DNA.  This means it is replication dependent, and will only decrease the level of DNA methylation on new DNA produced during replication--it will not reduce levels of methylation in a cell existing prior to treatment with the drug.  The exact mechanism of action leading ot its anti-tumor effect is still unclear, but it is thought that it may work in hematological malignancies (MDS) where tumor-suppressor genes are often hypermethylated and therefore silent.  With less methylation, they may not be silent, and may be able to perform their tumor suppressor function, stopping the growth of cancer cells.<br /></div>
