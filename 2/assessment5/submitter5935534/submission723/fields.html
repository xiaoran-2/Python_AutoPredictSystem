    <div class="field-value"><p>1 DNA methylation at CpG Islands (situated in the promotor of a gene)indicates the gene is likely to be transcriptionally silent.    In general you do not see Methylation on CpG islands in normal cells,.</p><p>2 In cancer we see a swap(in term where to find the DNA methylation)., the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated now.So the promotor CpG Islands tend to become hypermethylated. This epigenetic mark is reversible.</p><p>3 Hypermethylation causes silencing in the promotor of the tumor suppressor genes by locking in a silent inactive state, which is mitotically heritable. As result cellgrowth, a hyper-plastic state.. Hypermethylation(locus specific) at CpG islands progresses from the starting moment of cancer to the metastatic state of the tissue. The CpG Islands become more dense during this process.We first see normal tissue changes into hyper-plastic,then into neoplastic tissue and then into invasive tissue.  </p><p>4 Most of the genome is made up of these intergenic intervals or repetitive elements or other places where in general you would find that the CpG's were methylated in a NORMAL cell. This wide spread methylation is very important for genetic stability. Repeats are heterochromatized.</p><p>5 So in cancer we see a genome- wide spread hypomethylation ( in every tumor), very early in tumorigenesis, it progresses like the hypermethylation of the CpG islands.The hypomethylation most occur at the repeats, but also at the intergenic regions.</p><p>6 Now we see a lot of instability all over the genome of the tumor cells.</p><p>.-We see illegitimate recombination between repeats .</p><p> -We see activations of repeats( they make copies of themselves) and transposition, it needs activation of open chromatin.</p><p>-We see cryptic promotors and disruption to neighboring genes. </p><p>In this situation we see deletions/ reciprocal translocations/ insertions</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1 Paternal allele: Normally the paternal imprint control region (ICR) is methylated,( that blocks insulator binding CTCF), enabling expression driven by distal enhancers. DNA Methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence H19 and enhancers can access now Igf2 to activate.. And now    Igf2 can be expressed. It is growth promoting, and ok if only expressed by 1 allele (single dosis).</p><p>2 Maternal allele: On this allele CTCF  binds to the ICR, so no methylatiion at the ICR and now enhancers help to express H19 ( a longcoding RNA) and the enhancers can not express Igf2 now. CTFC is an insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. So NO growth    promoting gene on maternal allele.</p><p>3 Wilm's tumor: Because of hypermethylation we see loss of imprinting of the maternal allele( 11th chromosome).. Now that allele is the same as the paternal allele.Now we see on the maternal allele also Igf2 expression. Now Igf2 is double expressed, double dose . </p><p>4The result is too much growth promoting.Because we see too much epression of Igf2.This is associated with Wilm"s tumor.This occurs often in preneoplastic tissues. It is kidney cancer it is derived of embryonic tissue. More cell division caused by more growth promoters. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1 Decitabine belongs to the DNMT inhibitors (5-azacitidine) They are DNA-demethylating agents. They are nucleoside analogues.</p><p>2 It is a drug targeting the enzymatic epigenetic regulator: DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1). So they get incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then when the DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide,( then  DNMT1 copies the Methylation to the daughter strand normally), but with Decitabine DNMT1 is then bound irreversibly. And it can no longer be released. So Decitabine only can work during cell replicating.</p><p>3 So this means that cancercells which are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body will be more severely affected because they are replicating more. If there is no sufficient DNMT1(because of Decitabine), in the daughter strand, there is a lack of genome wide spread methylation in that daughter cell, so many of these new cells will die.</p><p>So the tumor stops growing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1 Epigenetics changes are passed on during celldivision untill they are actively erased. If they are once erased they do not return. DNMT1i   and the Histone-deacetylase inhibitor enzyme slowed tumor growth. These changes were passed on (an enduring effect).  After this treatment the normal chemotherapy seemed to be much more effective. Probably there is less hypermethylation on the CpG islands now.</p><p>2 A sensitive period is when altered environments ( for example drugs or food or change in cytoplasm) have an effect on epigenetic control, there is a lot of reprogramming.</p><p>3 There are two sensitive periods in development of  the germ cells. The period of primordial germcell development (Started at mid-gestation) all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperm. The second sensitive period is the pre-implantationperiod and the early postimplantation period. Both are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome.</p><p>4 Environmental changes by these drugs can cause a lot  of trans-generationally heritable effect. In other words passed on to the offspring. And this younger people themselves can get  lot of side effects in their cells, for example the drugs affect also other protein deacetylation, and seems to inhibit the acethylation of other transcription factors.</p></div>
