    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is process strictly controlled by cells. Every abnormalities could cause different diseases including cancer.<br /><br />In general normal cell has some genome methylation pattern. We can distinguish: hypomethylation in CpG islands and hypermethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. CGI are usually hypomethylated. Methylation of CGI in promotor region is synonymous of gene silencing. <br />Disruption of methylation in cancer can look different depending on mechanism. Firstly when we consider disruption of methylation in CpG islands in cancer then we see hypermethylation (instead of hypomethylation in normal cells) of single genes or hypermethylation of sets of genes. In cancer those hypermethylation usually concern tumor suppressor genes, which then are silenced so it can promote abnormal growth. Sometimes we observe hypomethylation of some CpG islands in promotors responsible for activating oncogens. But that seems to be minor cause.<br /><br />In other hand hypermethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cell protects our genome and provide its stability. Many experiments show that disruption of proper methylation in these regions can cause cancer. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions cause chromosome mutations like: deletions, insertions and translocations. Many type of cancers shows genomic instability caused by disruption in intergenic regions methylation. In addition hypomethylation of transposable elements promotes malignancy. The mechanism of work could be different. Unmethylated transposons can be transcribed and integrated in random place in genome. This of course is mutagenic. The second mechanism rely on strong promotors of repetitive elements which can alter transcription of other genes in genome.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinted genes are those which shows monoallelic expression what means that it's expressed only from maternal or only from paternal allele. H19/Igf2 cluster is one example of gene imprinting.The mechanism of imprinting in this cluster is based on insulator blocking protein.<br /><br />CTCF protein binds to unmethylated ICR on maternal allele what insulate Igf2 gene and promote H19 expression.<br /><br />In other hand ICR is methylated on paternal allele what prevents CTCF from binding. Methylation is expanded on H19 gene promotor so now enchancers promote Igf2 expression.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour we observe the same methylation pattern on both alleles. Maternal allele is methylated in ICR so it looks exactly like paternal allele. This leads to overexpression of Igf2 protein and no expression of H19. We know that imprinted genes are often regulate expression of genes involved in cell growth regulation. Indeed in this case Igf2 is growth promotion protein so double dose of this particle can lead to cancer.<br /><b></b></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug which inhibites work of DNMTs. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which after incorporation in DNA, irreversibly binds to demethylotransferases. The requirement of incorporation means that this process is replication dependent. <br /><br />Binding with DNMTs leads to global decrease of DNA methylation. In some cancers when we're dealing with hypermethylation of tumour supressor genes, use of decitabine will lead to decrease of DNA methylation in this region either. This will make that this genes again will be expressed and that can stop the tumour growth. Unfortunately this is not specific effect so it cause side effect too.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Mitotic heritability of epigenetic marks (eg. DNA methylation) is the solution of why effects of epigenetic drugs can lasts beyond period of treatment. DNA methylation can be passed through next generations of cells until it's fully erased. So when we treat cancer cells with epigenetic drug then even if we won't kill all cells, the rest of the cells (and their daughter cells etc.) will had those epigenetic changes caused by drug. That's why patient who were treated standard chemotherapy after epigenetic drugs treatment could be more susceptible to it.<br /><br />Unfortunately there is a high risk of using epigenetic drugs in sensitive periods of development. Sensitive period is a critical period when epigenetic marks are developing and establishing. Especially early embryonic development and germ cell development are sensitive periods because then reprogamming of epigenome occurs. <br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods is dangerous because it could lead to dramatic, <strong>global</strong> changes in epigenome and in consequence could lead to many diseases.</div>
