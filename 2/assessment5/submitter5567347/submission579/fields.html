    <h1>Submission 579 from Anon (session_user_id: 53612c8db631d5b4cd2e04e2f39b62ebb0e18c91)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine falls under the category of DNA-demethylating agents. They have an antagonistic effect on DNA methylation and prevent silencing of genes which are crucial for tumour growth prevention, such as tumor-suppressor genes. In the case of MDS (Myelodysplastic syndromes) the hypomethylating effect of Decitabine has allowed for the re-expression of tumor-suppressor genes in patients. Since epigenetic changes are mitotically inheritable, all the daughter cells will express the tumour-suppressor gene unless the expression is actively erased.<br /><br /> Also, a cocktail of epigenetic drugs have been used to treat solid tumors, and these patients show better response to the standard chemotherapeutic agents, opening the possibility of a two-pronged approach to treat cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell the CpG island promoters are hypomethylated leading to the expression of the gene lying downstream of the promoter. The repetitive elements, intronic regions, and intergenic regions, in normal cells, are hypermethylated causing them to not be expressed.  However, in cancer cells the opposite is seen with many CpG islands being hypermethylated leading to downstream inactivation of genes. If these genes are tumour suppressor genes, there is a  loss of functionality of crucial checkpoints to cancer growth. In some cases there are CpG poor promoters (eg., R-RAS, miR21) which are normally hypermethylated in normal cells, but which are in some cases hypomethylated in cancers leading to overexpression of these genes. <br /><br />Hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repeats causes genomic instability (translocation, deletions, and insertions) when illegitimate recombinations occur. These hypomethylated regions can serve as cryptic promoters leading to activation of surrounding genes causing over expression of certain genes in the cells. In addition, these hypomethylated repeats have a tendency to move around and disrupt normal coding regions in the genome. <br /><br />Hence, the methylation effect of the DNA on cancer growth is context dependent as both hyper and hypomethylation of different sections of the genome can cause a combination of genomic instability, tumour suppressor inactivation, and activation of oncogenes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Igf2 or the Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 gene (growth promoting) is normally maternally imprinted and paternally expressed; the H19 gene codes for a polyadenylated long non-coding mRNA (growth restricting) which is paternally imprinted and maternally expressed. A hypothesis put forward for parental imprinting is the <span>"parental conflict hypothesis". The dad would like the mother to allocate a lot of resources to ensure the growth and development of his offspring, but the mother would rather have limited resource allocation for her survival and for her possible future offspring.  This competetion leads to the imprinting pattern seen in the Igf2/H19 locus. In Wilm's tumour this pattern of imprinting is disrupted causing tumour growth. Loss of Imprinting of the maternal Igf2 and hypermethylation of H19 gene causes biallelic expression of Igf2 in the patient and the absence of H19's growth suppressive property. The confluence of these two factors leads to tumour development.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The main reason why epigenetic drugs can have a long-lasting effect after the period of drug treatment is because the changes are mitotically heritable. Once a cell has had changes made to the epigenome, it is subsequently inherited by the daughter cells unless actively erased. In the case of DNA methylation, the pattern of methylation is inherited via mitosis from the parent cell. A sensitive period is defined as time of active epigenetic reprogramming when the cells are susceptible to epigenetic modifications. It is seen in phases of early embryonic development and during PGC (Primordial Germ Cell) development. This is the reason why pregnant women are not adminstered epigenetic drugs as it can adversely affect fetal development by modifying epigenetic mark establishment. Also, since these drugs specifically target cells exhibiting rapid cell division they are not given to young children as they are undergoing phases of cell division and growth.</div>
