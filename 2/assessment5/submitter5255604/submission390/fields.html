    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands
allows in themselves more denucleotides (called CpGs) than in the random
distribution. CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation: methylation at
CpG island is always a synonymous of silencing of gene expression.</p>

<p>In cancer
cells, how it has been first detected in colorectal cancer, it is more likely
to find abnormal high frequency of DNA methylation at CpG islands, associated
with patient's clinicopathological characteristics. Hypermethylation at CpG
islands can do the same job as genetic mutation, but it is always reversible,
having positive effects on prognosis and therapy of cancer.</p>

<p>Hypermethylation
at Cpg islands happens first and progresses over time: during tumor progression
it tends to accumulate higher level of DNA methylation. This aspect can lead to
genomic instability and silencing of tumor suppressor genes.</p>

<p><span>Intergenic  regions and repetitive elements represent the
most of the genome. In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements
are usually methylated to maintain the genomic integrity.</span></p>

<p><span> In cancer we can also recognize a kind of
aberration in the epigenetic control, correlated to genome - wide DNA
hypomethylation, in particular in repetitive elements and intergenic regions,
that represent most of the genome. In this case one of the main function of the
DNA methylation, maintaining the genomic stability, is lost.</span></p>

<p><span>Because of
hypometilation and the consequent loss of chromatin packaging, repeats elements
have the capacity of make a copy of themselves and jump around the genome
creating genomic instability (deletions, insertions or reciprocal
translocation)</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal
cell, depending on methylation patterns, we have a different expression of Igf2
in the paternal and in the maternal allele.</p>

<p>In the
paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated: the enhancers
can act on Igf2 and it can be expressed.</p>

<p>In the
maternal allele, in a normal cell, the imprint control region is unmethylated,
so unexpressed: the enhancers can't act on Igf2, that isn't expressed and they
can only express H19.</p>

<p>In cancer
cells, we can find a loss of imprinting: genes that should be displayed no long
bring the imprinted expression. It leads to the expression or silencing of the
same gene, both on parental and maternal alleles.</p>

<p>In the
Wilm's tumor we have the loss of imprinting of the Igf2 cluster.</p>

<p><span>We notice
hypermetilation of imprint control regions both on maternal and paternal allele,
that leads to the expression of Igf2 in the maternal allele as well.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
in an epigenetic drug, already on the market sold as Dacogen by a Japanese
company, and belongs to the DNA - demethylating agents. In can be used, for
example, in myelodysplastic syndrome treatments.</p>

<p>According
with the last researches, that display hypermetilation in CpG islands in cancer
cells, Decitabine as a DNA demethylating agent, can act on aberrant epigenetic
patterns and restore the correct level of DNA methylation.</p>

<p>Decitabine
can act fighting the numerous epigenetic alteration in cancer cells, due to
Hypermetilation, in the two main aspects correlated to:</p>

<p>- genomic
instability and deregulation of tissue;</p>

<p><span>- the
silencing of tumor suppressor genes by hypermetilation of their promoters in
Cpg islands</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According
to dr Baylin's study, using epigenetic drugs, that act altering DNA methylaion,
can produce positive effects on cancer cells, in term of slowed tumor growth.</p>

<p>Altering
DNA methylation with epigenetic drugs can have enduring effects on the epigenome
because, unlike other form of gene regulations, are passed on during cell
division. We have, anyway, to take care to use epigenetic drugs not in a
sensitive period.</p>

<p>A sensitive
period in a period of epigenetic reprogramming in which there is an active
remodeling of the epigenome.</p>

<p>In the
mammalian development there are two sensitive periods: in early development,
from the gametes to the blastocyst, and later during germ cells development.</p>

<p><span>Treating
patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods would be inadvisable
because of the epigenome reprogramming: in these periods all the effects of the
epigenetic drugs would be lost with the reprogramming. </span></p>
