    <div class="field-value">DNA is usually methylated at cytosines in CpG sequences and is associated with silencing of gene expression. Many CpG sequences are grouped in clusters called CpG islands. Promoters with methylated CpG islands are usually silenced. Also the regions surrounding CpG islands are normally methylated at CpGs. <br />In cancer cells more CpG islands are methylated (hypermethylation). Sometimes tumor suppressor genes are silenced and cancer cells can grow and evade apoptosis. Methylation is considered a heritable epimutation and descendants of the first cancer cell (including metastasis) have it. For example hypermethylation (resulting in silencing) of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene leads to breast cancer.<br />In contrast, CpG sequences not part of CpG islands are unmethylated or hypomethylated in cancer cells. Such loci are intergenic regions, repetitive elements, CpG-poor promoters and CpGs inside genes. Methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements help maintain genomic stability and normal replication. When they are disrupted in cancer, hypomethylation in these regions leads to genomic instability, breaks and abnormal recombinations in DNA, activation of repeats and transpositions, activation of cryptic promoters, inactivation of neighboring genes such as oncogenes, etc. This could lead to activation of an oncogene or inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. For example: R-RAS in gastric cancer.<br />Overall, hypermethylation of CpG islands and hypomethylation of intergenic or repetitive DNA can be seen as one of the hits in DNA leading to cancer (cancer becomes manifest as a disease after several lesions or hits in DNA allow it to grow and efficiently evade immune clearance). Cells acquiring an epimutation gain an advantage over healthy cells and can proliferate and replace normal cells. Plus, their genome tends to become unstable allowing for accumulation of subsequent hits and more severe cancer. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a healthy cell Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele.<br />The ICR and the promoter of H19 are methylated on the paternal allele so CTCF cannot bind ICR and the enhancers can bind to the promoter of IGF2. <br />On the maternal allele, the ICR andthe promoter of the growth-suppressor H19 are not methylated so CTCF can bind it and the downstream enhancers could enhace the expression of H19, not IGF2.<br />In Wilm's tumor, ICR is methylated in both alleles so the cell behaves as if it had 2 paternal alleles. That means that it will express double the dose of the growt-promoting Igf2 and very low doses of the growth-restricting H19.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is a cytidine analog which, when incorporated into DNA, blocks DNA-methyltransferase. Drugs such as Decitabine have long-term effects on the genome which is cumulative over several mitoses. Thus, DNA methylation will achieve a near-normal level in many cancer cells over time without killing them. This may make them again responsive to environmental stimuli regulating their growth and differentiation and to standard chemotherapy.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic markers such as methylation are mitotically heritable (each cell inherits an allele with markers already in place and a new allele which is marked immediately). Therefore, all cells descending form a cell with a particular modification in the epigenome will show that modification. Over the life of an individual, there are some periods when cells are particularly more susceptible to epigenetic alterations because of the magnitude of epigenetic reprogramming which takes place in these phases of development: germ cell development and preimplantation phase. Pharmacological alterations during there periods could propagate to all cells of the children of the person being treated and very probable to grandchildren.<br /></div>
