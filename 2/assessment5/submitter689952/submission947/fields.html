    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cellular operation, the CpG Islands exist and are maintained in an unmethylated or minimally methylated state.  Once oncogenesis has begun, many of these normal CpG islands become highly methylated, even hyper-methylated.  The result of this action is silencing of both (depending on the particular tissue the oncogenesis is occurring in) paternal and maternal alleles or the activation of both.  This has the potential to create a substantial shortage or overflow in the wrong proteins being produced.  As many of these products made are tumor supressor proteins, a shortage may allow uncontrolled cellular growth, and an overabundance of others could overstimulate cellular growth.<br />Under normal curcumstances, repetitive elements are normally silenced via DNA methylation and/or epigenetic marks that in turn bundle down chromatin into hetero chromatin and thus prevent any impact on the DNA genome.  In cells that have become oncogenic, some of this methylation is removed from repetitive elements and their promoters.  This allows the unexpected activation of these repeats and thus results in potentially: incorrect or excessive gene products being produced, unexpected transcription as many of these promoters are bidirectional, seemly randomly alterations to the genome.  The end result of this unregulated de-methylation is an overall increase in the instability of the DNA genome and allowances of errors within it.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster is one such cluster that is affected by cancer and pre-cancers.  In it's natural state, the maternal allele is unmethylated, and thus the promoter is free to act on the H19 region and produced the protein.  On the Paternal allele, the control region is methylated, and thus silencing H19.  Because of this methylation, the enhancers are now able to act on Igf2.  This in turn produces that gene product.<br />If Cancer occurs, most frequently, hyper-lamentation occurs in this region.  Both Maternal and Paternal control regions become methylated, and as a result, both alleles produce Igf2.  Igf2, being a growth hormone, encourages cellular growth and tumourgenesis.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
