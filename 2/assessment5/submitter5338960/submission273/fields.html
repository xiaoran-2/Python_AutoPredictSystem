    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell you'd find the paternal allele methylated at the imprint control region, allowing the enhancer to interact with the Igf2 gene so it gets transcribed. Also, you'd usually find the maternal allele unmethylated at the imprint control region, allowing CTCF to bind to the insulator, blocking transcription of Igf2 and inducing transcription of the H19 gene.<br />In a Wilm's tumour, however, both alleles are methylated, inducing the expression of Igf2 in both copies of the gene resulting in cells with a double dose of Igf2. Since Igf2 is growth promoting, the methylation in this locus actually helps the tumour to develop and grow faster or can even determine if a preneoplastic tissue develops a cancer or not.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, CpG islands are mostly unmethylated because they are found in cancer suppressor genes promoters, allowing them to work properly. In cancer, however, these CpG islands are usually heavily hypermethylated, avoiding the expression of the tumour suppressor. Also, since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, all the cells of the tumour will share this epimutation. Considering this, in a cancer cell with CpG island hypermethylation, there will be no cancer supressors, allowing a faster development of the tumour.<br />Also, in a normal cell, we would find the intergenic and repetitive elements methylated, mantaining genomic stability. Without this methylation, it's easier to find recombination between non homologous repeats, deletions or insertions which are harder to find in methylated heterochromatin. In cancer, however, these regions are hypomethylated, reducing genomic stability and making it easier for repetitions to transpose disrupting the genome. Also hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters induce the activation of genes that are usually silent, for example, some oncogene such as R-RAS. <br />In conclusion, hypermethylation of CpG islands usually makes tumour suppressors stay silent while genome wide hypomethylation induces instability, activates oncogenes or induces tumour suppressor silencers.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a FDA approved DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. This drug is a nucleotide analog, which means that binds into the DNA upon replication acting as a normal nucleotide. When DNMT1 binds to insert a methyl, it gets trapped and loses it's functionality in the cell. This process means that we are clearing the cell of DNMT1, avoiding any kind of methylation. This, of course, means that hypermethylation of the CpG islands found at the promoters of cancer suppressors is no longer possible, avoiding the further development of a tumour. Also, since Decitabine binds into the DNA upon replication, and cancer cells are the ones where replication happens more often, cancer cells will be the most affected by this drug. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes in the DNA methylation are mitotically heritable because after the DNA gets replicated, the DNMT copies the original methylations into the new strand. This facts means that  changes produced in a cell epigenome will endure in all the descendants even if the treatments affecting the methylation stops.<br />This kind of treatment, however, should not be used during "sensitive periods". There are two sensitive periods, epigenetically speaking: early development of an embryo and development of the germ cells. These two moments in development are vital to the epigenetic development because  former epigenetic markers are erased and new ones are set. Treating a pregnant women or a very young patient would cause changes in their cells, but also more severe changes to their embryo or developing germ cells. For example, if we used a drug which inhibits methylation, the developing germ cells would have their epigenetic marks erased as usual but would be unable to set the new ones because of the drug we are using, probably inducing fertility problems. In conclusion, if we used epigenetic drugs in someone during a sensitive period, we would potencially be inducing changes in two generations, and that's why it's inadvisable to do so.</div>
