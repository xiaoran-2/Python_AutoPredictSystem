    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the CpG islands are not methylated
regardless of their state of expression. 
During cancer, there is an increase in the methylation in the CpG
islands as cells progress from normal tissue to hyperplasia, to neoplasia and
finally invade surrounding tissue.  DNA
methylation aberrations increase with age as well.</p>

<p>Methylation at the islands in cancer leads to silencing of
genes involved in tumour suppression. 
DNA methylations at the CpG islands is an alternative method to yield
cancer instead of genetic mutation of the tumor suprressor genes- both
mechanism achieve the sam end, which is a decrease in the tumor suppressor
proteins.  Examples of hypermethylation
include RB in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer, BRCA1 in breast cancer
and MGMT in gliomas and colorectal cancers. 
Hypermethylation is a common epigenetic alteration found in cancer
cells, which can serve as a marker for diagnosis of disease, an indicator of
aggressiveness of the cancer, and may inform care giver of treatment options.</p>

<p>In contrast, in normal cells, the intergenic regions and
repetitive elements are methylated, whereas in cancer they are not methylated.  The hypomethylation at repeats and intergenic
regions leads to genomic instability. 
This can lead to illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation
of repeats and transposition, as well as activate cryptic promoters and disrupting
neighboring genes.</p>

<p>Mouse models with DNA methyl transferase (Dnmt1) knocked out
in specific tissue results in increased genomic instability.  Also, DNMT3B mutations in humans are seen in
ICF syndrome, which results in genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal conditions, the paternal ICR (Imprint Control
Region) is methylated, which blocks the insulator (CTCF) from binding to block
access to Igf2 for the enhancers. 
Without CTCF bound, the paternal Igf2 is expressed.</p>

<p>In contrast, the maternal ICR is not methylated in normal
cells, and the insulator protein (CTCF) can bind and insulate Igf2 from the
downstream enhancers.  This means that
the maternal Igf2 is not expressed. </p>

<p>However, in the case of hypermethylation of the ICR, both
the maternal and paternal chromosomes will be methylated at the ICR, which will
result in no insulation of either allele by CTCF.  Therefore, both the maternal and paternal
versions will be expressed and there will be Igf2 overexpression.  This is seen in Wilm’s tumor.</p>

<p>In Wilm’s tumor, there is a double dose of the growth promoting
factor, as both alleles are expressed due to hypermethylation. </p>

<p>Without the insulator protein, CTCF, present, the DNA
methylation will spread to the H19 promoter to silence it and the enhancers
will activate Igf2.  This leads to the
upregulation of Igf2 and is growth promoting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA demethylating class of epigenetic drugs.  This particular inhibitor would block DNA
methyl transferase (DNMT).  Methylation of the DNA would be inhibited.  This
would mean that the DNA would remain unmethylated and would not be silenced.</p>

<p>Decitabine would have an anti-tumor effect, if the tumor
resulted from hypermethylation, such as in the CpG islands in some cancers such
as retinoblastoma or colon cancer.  In
general, DNA that is methylated is silenced. Not allowing the hypermethylation
would keep genes active, which would be necessary for tumor suppressors to be
expressed.  Administration of decitabine would result in a decrease in the methylation of DNA in the tumor cells and result in appropriate expression of the tumor suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a type of epigenetic mark.  The alteration of epigenetic marks can have
lasting effects, since the epigenetic marks are mitotically inheritable.  The cells in which the DNA methylation
pattern was changed can pass that change along to their descendants until the
marks are reset during a sensitive period.</p>

<p>A sensitive period is when the epigenetic marks are cleared
and reset. Sensitive periods include gametogenesis and after fertilization.  Administering a epigenetic drug during the sensitive
period could affect normal cell development, thus it would be inadvisable.  It would be inadvisable as it would result in
the alteration of normal epigenetic marks that are required for normal growth
and development of the organism.  Thus,
anytime that the patient had a sensitive period epigenetic drugs should be
avoided.  This would include young
children and expectant mothers.</p></div>
