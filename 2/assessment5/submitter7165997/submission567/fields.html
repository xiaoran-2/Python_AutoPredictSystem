    <div class="field-value">In studying the underlying causes of cancer, DNA methylation is an important area to consider.  CpG islands are segments of DNA that are associated with promotor regions of genes.  Normally DNA is unmethylated at CpG islands which is a sign that the particular gene is turned on.  However, in cancer cells we see the opposite-- hypermethylation at the CpG islands and even the CpG island shores.  This hypermethylation causes tumor suppressing genes to be silenced in the genome lending itself to the formation of some types of cancers.  <br /><br />While we see an increase in DNA methylation at CpG islands in cancer cells, in other areas we see a genome wide hypomethylation. Normally the methylation in the genome is useful in that the repetitive and intergenic regions of the DNA are silenced.  In cancer patients this hypomethylation of the genome can cause genomic instability due to the fact that the unmethylated regions of DNA are now more open and subject to activation, reciprocal translocations, recombinations and transpositions.  This affects how the genes in these cancer tissues are expressed and can contribute to the inability of the DNA to repair itself promoting cancer formation.  Additionally hypomethylation of CpG poor promotors can cause an activation of oncogenes directly and the formation of cancer (although this is less common). <br /><br />Both of these phenomena (hypermethylation of CpG islands and genome-wide hypomethylation)  can contribute to the formation of cancer and each type of cancer will have a different interplay between the two.  The two can even change throughout the development of a tumor and treatment needs to be specialized with regard to these dependencies.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Hypermethylation and hypomethylation of imprint control regions can contribute to tumour formation.  The H19/lgf2 cluster is one region that has been studied.  In a normal cell, the paternal H19 promoter region is methylated and CTCF cannot bind causing the enhancers to promote the expression of Igf2--a growth promoting gene.  On the maternal allele this region is unmethylated causing CTCF to bind and the enhancers promote the expression of H19 instead.  In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele is instead hypermethylated and the enhancers promote the expression of lgf2 on both chromosomes maternal and paternal.  In this case the individual is getting a double dose of Igf2.  Igf2 promotes the growth and proliferation of cells of many types and this double dose can contribute to the proliferation of cancer cells.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi) and is useful in the treatment of some types of cancers.   Decitabine inhibits DNA methyl transferases and blocks the methylation of DNA in subsequent daughter cells during replication.  Because this demethylation is dependent on cell replication, tumour cells are more highly affected by the drug as by their very nature they replicate more rapidly.  Thus decitabine suppresses tumour formation.  <br /><br />In cancer cells many tumour suppressing regions are methylated and tumour suppressing genes are blocked contributing to the the proliferation of cancer cells. It is unclear if decitabine is working to demethylate these regions specifically, but it is likely to at least be a contributing factor in the drug efficacy in eradicating certain cancer types.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have lasting effects far after drug treatment.  DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is mitoticially inheritable.  That is, the methylation is conserved and transferred to every daughter cells' DNA.  If drugs are used to remove these methylation marks, they are unlikely to return in subsequent cells.  Drug therapies that demethylate DNA would need to be avoided during sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming.  Sensitive periods include early development of the blastocyst and in primordial germ cell formation where DNA methylation marks are removed and replaced in much of the epigenome.  We wouldn't want to block the methylation of DNA at these times as it might permanently and detrimentally effect methylation and thus gene expression for a wide number of genes.  These would probably include important genes with specific cell function.  Additionally demethylation of imprinted genes only occurs during primordial germ cell formation. If a pregnant patient was treated with a demethylation drug during this time, an imprinting disorder could arise in the subsequent generation.  </div>
