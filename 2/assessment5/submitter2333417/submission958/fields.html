    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is generally not found normally at CpG islands, although it is at CpG dinucleotides (60 - 90%), where there are a high prevalence of CpG dinucleotides, which helps maintain genomic integrity. In cancer, however, there is excess methylation, or hypermethylation of these areas during cancer. When this is epigenetically disrupted, however, there is a general effect that acts to suppress the tumor suppressor genes, which are essentially the brakes and police of the body, that try to ensure that no cells are growing too rapidly, and halt them if they are. However, with suppressed tumor suppressors taking multiple hits as per the Knudson Hypothesis, nothing tells an aberrantly growing cell to stop, so it continues to grow incessantly.<br /><br />DNA methylation of the genome is, in a normal cell, found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Silencing of these areas serves to prevent genetic instability and prevents events like illegitimate recombination between repeats, transposition, and other genetic and chromosomal aberrations. However, in cancer, these regions are not methylated, and since methylation is mitotically heritable, the progeny of this modified cell will also have unmethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This contributes to cancer in that it can cause abnormal karyotypes and compromises genome integrity, but it can also act to activate oncogenes in the case of CpG poor promoters, where the growth of cells is promoted.<br /><br />DNA methylation changes is one of the hallmarks of cancer, that can occur more frequently across cancerous cells that genetic mutations, and the above provides the mechanism and how it is altered in cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, which spreads to and silences H19. This prevents the insulator CTCF from binding, which allows the upstream enhancers to access and express the Igf-2 gene. However, on the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated. This means that the H19 region is active. The enhancers, however, cannot bind to the Igf-2 gene, because the CTCF is physically blocking it. This prevents expression of the Igf-2. In Wilm's tumor, this system is disrupted, and the paternal methylation pattern occurs on both chromosomes. This causes the Igf-2 to be expressed twice as much as normal, on both chromosomes. Igf-2, or Insulinlike growth factor 2, is a gene that promotes cellular division, so having two copies of this gene would greatly increase the rate of cellular growth and division. Thusly, the disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, specifically Wilm's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug that belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA demethylating agents. These remove the methylation marks from the genome, decreasing genome methylation levels, and thusly counteracting the effects of hypermethylation. These can have an anti-tumor effect in one of the types of tumors discussed: those that primarily divide incessantly that rely on the silencing and hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes. This drug removes the hypermethylation of these tumor suppressors, which effectively prevents their silencing, which promotes their expression, activating the cellular brakes. This would stop aberrant cell division, and thusly would have the desired anti-tumor effect for the patient.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since DNA methylation is a mitotically inheritable mark, it can last through subsequent cell divisions. So, when a cell that has been impacted with this drug that alters its DNA methylation divides, the progeny and offspring will also have this same alteration due to the hemi-methylated preservation of the marks. A sensitive period is one where the cell is undergoing a period of epigenetic reprogramming, and is more susceptible to environmental factors and epigenetic changes. The two epigenetic periods are from primordial germ cell development to the production of gametes, and the second one is post-implantation. During these periods, the cell is more sensitive to the environment, so it is necessary to proceed with caution and not treat patients with this type of drug during this time. Because it is a sensitive period for the patient, they are more susceptible to environment, and their epigenome is also more likely to change. Thusly, this drug could have a lasting effect on the patient or their progeny, as they are just clearing and resetting the epigenetic marks. So, it would be inadvisable to treat patients during their sensitive periods.</div>
