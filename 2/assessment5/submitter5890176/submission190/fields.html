    <div class="field-value">In a normal genome, CpG islands are hypomethylated allowing for normal expression of genes. On the other hand, in a cancerous genome, the DNA at the CpG islands and even CpG island shores tend to be hypermethylated, and this hypermethylation increases over time, but DNA methylation at CpG islands differs from on tumour type to another and are commonly locus specific. DNA methylation at CpG islands of tumour supressor genes causes under expression of that tumour suppressor. The DNA methylation is effective for a cancer cell because it gives the cell a competitive advantage in terms of mitotic heritability and resistance to death. Hypermethylation at CpG islands can also aid in clinical diagnostics, prognostics, and possible treatment identification. <br />Intergenic regions, repetitive elements, CpG poor promoters, and even introns of a normal genome are usually hypermethylated, but in a cancer cell, these regions tend to be hypomethylated; however, the amount and number of these regions affected in a cancer cell is largely locus specific, mostly common in the repetitive elements rather than the other intergenic regions, and begins early in the cancer formation process. Hypomethylation at repetitive elements causes genomic instability due to chromosome misalignment during cell division due to the fact that the chromosomes are not as densely packaged down. Genomic instability is also due to activation of repeats causing transpositions which can harm genes. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can result in either over expression of an oncogene, or even expression of a microRNA like miR21 that targets the tummour supressor PTEN. But overall, DNA methylation's role in cancer is widely context dependent. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normally imprinted cell's genome, the Igf2 gene is expressed by the paternal allele because the imprint control region, or ICR,  is methylated. This methylation inhibits the insulator protein CTCF from binding to the ICR so that enhancers can act on Igf2. On the paternal allele there is also hypermethylation near the H19 gene causing silencing of expression. However, the maternal allele of a normally imprinted cell's genome at the Igf2/H19 cluster expresses the H19 gene but not the Igf2 gene. This occurs because the ICR is hypomethylated. Hypomethylation at this ICR leads to binding of the CTCF, an insulator protein, to the ICR inhibiting the enhancers from acting on Igf2, so they insead act oh H19. In Wilm's tumour however, both the maternal and paternal alleles exhibit hypermethylation of the ICR. Since the ICR is methylated, the enhancers at this cluster act on Igf2, a growth promoting gene, in both alleles creating a double dose of Igf2 expression. Because Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, a double dose of this gene can, and often does, lead to growth of tumours--especially Wilm's tumour, a childhood kindey tumour. Loss of imprinting is observed genome wide in early cancers.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that is used to fight cancer that belongs to the family or DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, or DNMTi. This drug is FDA approved in use against myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to a stage of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). When Decitabine is given in an appropriate dose, it incorporates itself into the genome--due to the fact that it is a nucleoside analogue--and permanently binds to DNA methyltranferases, or DNMTs, causing DNA demethylation. This treatment is dependent on cell division putting all cells at risk, but since cancer cells have a high division rate, they tend to be more severely affected. In terms of an anti-tumour effect, DNMTis will have an anti-neoplastic effect when given at an appropriate does. Demethylation of cancerous cells is vital because it could protect the stability of the genome, maintain methylation at oncogenes, or resist methylation at tumour supressor genes preventing tumourigenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Meaning, when a cell divides, DNMTs will transfer the marks from the father strand to the daughter strand so that both strands have the same epigenetic marks. There are sensitive periods during development when some epigenetic marks have to be removed. This occurs so that cells can be totipotent or develop into very specialized cells for reproduction like a sperm or egg. The most sensitive periods during development epigenetically are during pre-implantation and primordial germ cell, or PGC, development. During pre-implantation, the maternal genome's epigenetic marks (DNA methylation) are passively removed, the paternal genome's marks are actively removed, the imprinted genes and repeats' marks are maintained. However, during PGC development, all the same marks are wiped/maintained except for imprinted genes--they are wiped of their epigenetic marks during PGC development. It would be inadvisable to treat a patient during one of these periods because the epigenome is extremely sensitive, and the changes that the epigenome is experiencing could affect generations to come. For example, if a pregnant mother is treat and her baby is going through PGC development, three generations could be in jeopardy.</div>
