    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell CPG islands in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes are normally hypomethlyated. This allows the gene to be expressed. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the gene are hypermethylated for genomic stability. In cancer, the methylation pattern is usually reversed, so the CPG islands become hypermethylated, thereby silencing the tumor suppressor gene and the intergenic regions, and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, causing genomic instability. Because these epimutations are mitotically heritable these cancerous cells have a selective advantage and thereby spread uncontrollably leading to a cancerous tumor.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster the ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated which allows CTCF to bind to it, allowing the enhancers to act on H19. This means that Igf2 will not be expressed. The ICR of the paternal allele is methylated thereby allowing the enhancers to act on Igf2 which will then be expressed creating Igf2 protein. In cancer, the maternal allele is methylated, so there's a loss of imprinting which allows it to act in the same way as the paternal allele, thereby creating double the amount of Igf2 protein. As Igf2 is growth promoting, having cells produce twice the amount of this protein leads to Wilm's tumor.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor which is a nucleoside analogue. These get incorporated into the DNA so that when DNMT1 is attracted to the hemi-methylated DNA it binds to it and can no longer be released. This stops the spread of the cancerous cells without having to kill them.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so that any changes to DNA methylation will be passed on to all daughter cells. Sensitive periods are when the genome is being actively reprogrammed. These are mainly during primordial germ cell development and during the pre-implantation early development period. Using any drug treatment that alters methylation during any of these sensative periods would be bad as these changes would be passed on to all daughter cells.<br /></div>
