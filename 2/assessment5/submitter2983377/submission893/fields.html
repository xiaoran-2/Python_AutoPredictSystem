    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are found in many promoters and are usually kept unmethylated in normal cells. In cancer cells, locus specific CpG islands in promoters of tumor supressor genes are hypermethylated. This contributes to tumor supressor gene silencing which promotes cancer development. Also, DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so all cells originating from cancer cells have these epimutations. In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated (inhibition of transposition). In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be genome-wide hypomethylated which then contributes to genomic instability by illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, Igf2 gene of the parternal allele is unmethylated because the insulator and part of H19 gene are methylated. Since this insulator, when unmethylated, binds a factor (CTCF) which inhibits the activation of Igf2 gene by a downstream enhancer. When the insulator is methylated, the enhancer can act upon activation of Igf2. In normal cells, Igf2 gene of the maternal allele is not active since the insulator is not methylated so the enhancer acts directly upon the nearer H19 gene. In Wilm`s tumour, the insulator and part of H19 gene are methylated on both the maternal and the paternal alleles so the Igf2 is expressed on both of them. Igf2 gene promotes growth, so this basically promotes tumour growth and development.This is a common, yet early event in tumour progression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. It is<span> used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It is a nucleoside analogue. It binds DNA-methyl-transferase irreversibly so it basically has an anti-neoplastic effect enhancing DNA demethylation. The mechanism of its action is still not completely clear. Yet, in smaller dosage, decitabine is a potent anti-tumour agent. It is proposed that the main reason for these heamatological malignancies lies in hypermethylation of tumour-supressor genes. So, if decitabine inhibits DNMT, it inhibits hypermethylation so has an anti-tumour effect.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is maintained throughout the division of a cell thanks to DNMT1 which is a maintainance methyl-transferase. By a sensitive period in this case we mean the period during which a patient is developing germ cells. Sensitive periods of development are those when active reprograming of epigenetic marks occurs. Those are the period of primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these periods could be inadvisable because these drugs are spread out to many tissues and especially in younger patients may have a negative influence on the development of germ cells. </div>
