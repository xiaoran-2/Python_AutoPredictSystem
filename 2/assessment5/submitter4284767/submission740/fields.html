    <h1>Submission 740 from Anon (session_user_id: d00e03452187f1acb992c6d7627608bb449e03b8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>

<p>DNA methylation will typically be
propagated during mitosis. It seems that these medications act by stripping some of the methylation that keeps the tumor suppressor genes silenced, as well as possibly the ones regulating apoptosis. This in turn makes them more susceptible to die. </p><p>The daughter cells of tumor cells
altered by the epigenetic drugs have then a high probability, barring other
interferences to keep the alteration. This would explain that the alteration
that makes them more sensitive to chemotherapy would be kept in the cell line.</p>

<p>Sensitive periods are periods
during which epigenetic marks are being established. </p>

<p>There are 2 such periods:</p>

</div><div>

<p>-         
the global remodeling following fertilization to create a
totipotent cell state, up to implantation.</p>

<p>-         
The time during which meiosis is occurring to generate oocytes,
or spermatozoids.</p>

</div><p>



</p><div>

<p>Treating patients during sensitive
period would probably interfere with the normal epigenetic modification occurring
at these time and have unpredictable consequences.</p>

</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>

<p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating
agent. It inhibits methyltransferase in a similar manner to azacitidine, but
only targets DNA strands. They are nuceloside analogues and they bind permanently
DNMTs during replication.</p>

<p>It is largely used to treat
syndromes that are precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia. </p>

</div>

<span>The mechanism of action is still unclear but it
seems that it acts by removing the hypermethylation of silenced tumor
suppressor genes. There are trials in many other types of tumors than the blood
cancers.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>

<p>IGF2 and H19 are in the same area
of the chromosome 11 (11q15.5). They are oppositely imprinted with IGF2
expressed on the paternal allele while H19 is expressed on the maternal allele.
IGF2 (insulin growth factor 2) is a growth factor for the embryo while H19 is
not currently fully understood.</p>

<p>The paternal allele of KvDMR1,
upstream of H19 is not normally methylated and this enables the IGF2 gene while
silencing the H19 and Cdkn1c genes.</p>

<p>The maternal allele of KvDMR1,
upstream of H19 is normally methylated and this enables the H19 and Cdkn1c
genes.</p>

<p>They are both controlled by a
differentially methylated region (DMR) upstream of H19 that controls the
activity of their gene promoters.</p>

<p>The Cdkn1c (cyclin dependent kinase
inhibitor) is a tumor suppressor, growth promoting gene, is activated on the
chromosome with the mother imprinting. With the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome,
the lack of the mother imprinting predisposes to childhood tumors like the
Wilm’s tumor.</p>

<p>The Cdkn1c is involved in
regulation several important cancer characteristics including apoptosis, cell
invasion, metastasis, tumor differentiation and angiogenesis. It is generally
not mutated in cancer but silenced or downregulated by epigenetic changes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>

<p>DNA methylation of the CpG sites
within the gene promoters is one of frequent ways by which genes are silenced. </p>

<p>In cancer cells, normal methylation
might be disrupted, and while genome wide there is DNA hypomethylation, some
promoter CpG island might become hypermethylated causing the silencing of the
corresponding gene, typically an tumor suppressor genes. </p>

<p>Hypermethylation was first identified
in colorectal cancers, and contributes to cancer heterogeneity, which is an
obstacle to to successful therapies, but mostly it impacts genes that regulate
tumor-associated processes. It might also be connected with the chromatin
architecture.</p>

<p>Intergenic regions are DNA areas
located between genes. They might contain pieces of DNA regulating nearby
genes, but also areas of unknown use. It contains also repetitive elements that
are hypermethylated and as a consequence inactive. This silencing is important
for genomic stability.</p>

<p>In cancer there is often a global
genomic hypomethylation, often related to mutations affecting TET proteins,
leading to genomic instability, and oncogene activation, meanwhile tumor
suppressors are silenced by hypermethylation. </p>

<p><span>Genomic instability translates in
illegal recombinations between repeats, activation of repeats and
transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters with disruptions to
neighboring genes. These mechanisms are often a large part of the uncontrolled
reproduction of cancer cells.</span></p>
