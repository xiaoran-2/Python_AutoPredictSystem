    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation generally leads to a heterochromatin state
of the DNA, thereby switching off genes and their function in the region of
methylation. CpG islands are sites for these methylation marks (Cytosine
nucleotides are methylated) on the DNA and are present at the promoter regions
of the gene. </p>

<p>Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands by
hyper-methylation of CpG islands in promoters of tumour suppressor genes leads
to inactivation of genes. The epigenetic state is then subsequently passed on
to cancer cells undergoing mitotic division. The frequency of hyper-methylated
CpG sites is more common than genetic mutations in cancer and considered as one
of the hits in Knudson hypothesis, which states that cancer is a result of
multiple hits to the DNA.  </p>

<p>In cancer tissues, the global levels of methylation decrease in areas such as genes, inter-genic regions, repetitive elements (H3ac, H4ac &amp; H3K4me decrease)(H3K9me &amp; H3K27me increase). Whereas, the level of methylation at some CpG islands increases, this leads to the formation of a cancer tissue. A panel of these CpG island hyper-methylation biomarkers can be used for diagnosis, prognosis and to monitor cancer formation. It serves as a biomarker that is sensitive enough to distinguish cancer from normal cells and identify specific features of a cancer. We can use the methylation difference between genes, inter-genic regions, repetitive elements and CpG islands to categories tissues, ranging from normal to cancer metastasis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon by which certain genes
are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. Disruption of imprinting
can lead to activation or deactivation of genes, thereby changing expression
levels of proteins in normal cells and leading to the formation of cancer
cells. </p>

<p> In H19/Igf2 cluster, paternal copy of H19/Igf2 cluster is active and expressed, whereas the maternal copy is inactive and not expressed. Wilms tumour patients have genetic and epigenetic mutations of IGF2 gene (which encodes insulin-like growth factor II). This is sometimes due to the loss of imprinting (LOI) of the normally repressed maternally inherited allele. LOI leads to activation of the maternal allele of IGF2, which in turn is because of differentially methylated region of the H19 gene cluster. The down regulation of H19 gene expression, leads to LOI of maternal allele of IGF2 in Wilms tumour. Overexpression of IGF2 is seen in patients with Wilms tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Accordin to Dr Dash Dhanak, inhibiting the activity of an overactive enzyme called EZH2 that is responsible for attachment of methyl groups to histone proteins can cure a lot of lymphomas. His inhibitor compound called GSK2816126, reduces histone over-methylation and preventing inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. In a second approach Dr James Bradner, shows his compound JQ1 inhibiting BRD4 enzyme, thereby blocking function of Myc gene, that is responsible for DNA regulation of 15% of human genes. <br /><br />Similarly, decitabine, sold as Dacogen, acts as a DNA-demethylating agent and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia. Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It prevents the deactivation of tumor suppressor genes. </div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr Stephen Baylin has been successful in treating lung
cancer by a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine.
According to his research, the epigenome of the tumour is being modified by
these drugs, which make them susceptible to chemotherapy. Apart from having
slowed growth of solid tumours, some patients responded unexpectedly good
reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs.<br /></p>

<p>We speculate that the altered epigenome of tumour cells is
passed on to daughter and granddaughter cells. The epigenetic drugs could be
influencing reactivation of genes that can affect tumour growth and cell death.
It could lead to a process of “memory” formation of the new epigenetics state
in these tumour cells. Sensitive period is the period in which these
epigenetics marks of methylation and acetylation are developed and established.
Sensitive periods of development are usually during gamete formation and embryogenesis
periods. </p>

<p>It would be inadvisable to treat patients who do not respond
to this kind of therapy or treat tumours that are not accessible by these
epigenetic drugs. In addition, the downstream side effect of these epigenetic
modifiers is still unknown and not proven to be safe for other tissues, cell
types, etc.</p></div>
