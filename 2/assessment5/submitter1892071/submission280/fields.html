    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are usually unmethylated with exceptions of imprinted genes, X-chromosome inactivation and heterochromatin formation. Methylation of promoter-associated CpG islands generally induces gene silencing. Methylation also occur at intergenic regions and repetitive elements to maintain genomic stability. Intergenic regions are methylated to regulate the alternate promoter sites and cryptic splice sites. Methylation of repeats prevents recombination and silences strong promoters located at these elements to suppress transcription interferences. Transposition of repeats are also suppressed.</p><p>In cancer cells, there is a genome-wide DNA hypomethylation and localised DNA hypermethylation compared to the normal cells. CpG islands and CpG islands shores are strongly methylated in cancer cells. This silences tumor suppressor genes and serves as a hit in Knusdon multiple-hits hypothesis. Demethylation in the intergenic regions leads to reactivation of repressed repetitive elements, transposition, alternate promoters, which may leads to spurious transcription initiations, increased gene disruption, DNA recombination rates and eventually genomic instability. Demethylation in CpG promoters of oncogenes or microRNAs that target tumor suppressor genes can result in their activation and acceleration of oncogenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic alteration in imprint control regions of cancer cells can lead to overexpression/underexpression of imprinted genes which can lead to tumorigenesis. For example, disruption of imprinting in H19/Igf2 cluster contribute to Wilm's tumor. The paternal allele's imprinted control region (ICR) is methylated while the maternal allele's is unmethylated. An insulator protein, CTFC, can bind to the unmethylated maternal allele's ICR and block the expression of the lgf2 gene from the downstream enhancers, which now act on H19. In the paternal allele, however, DNA methylation blocks CTFC from attachment and lead to expression of lgf2 and silencing of H19. In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele is also methylated. This results in activation of lgf2 and thus leads to double dosage of lgf2. lgf2 is a growth promoting gene and thus contributes to tumorigenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent. It is a nucleoside analog and gets incorporate into DNA upon replication where it bounds irreversibly to DNA <br />methyltransferase. Therefore the process is replication dependent and will preferentially affect cancer cells since they are dividing more rapidly than normal cells. Decitabine acts as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and help to revert hypermethylation-induced gene silencing by demethylation CpG island promoters of tumor suppressor and other cancer-related genes . Gene silencing of these genes by hpermethylation in cancer cells contribute to oncogenesis. The undoing of these epigenetic mutations can help control cancer cell proliferation and therefore can have an anti-tumour effect. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark and therefore is mitotic heritable. This means that the same sets of genes will be expressed in the daughter cells after cell division even after drug treatment period. During sensitive periods of development, where cells undergo epigenetic reprogramming, one should avoid undergoing the drug therapy. These periods are the delevopment of primordial germ cells to matured gametes and preimplantation and post-implantation embryos. Cells are reprogrammed on a genome wide level that include the erasure and reestablishment of parental genomic imprints in germ cells, resetting X-inactivation, the removal of epimutations, and the generation of totipotent cells.</p><p>During sensitive periods, drug exposure can cause modifications in epigenome and germ cells and influence development of offspring through embryo. Since these epigenetic changes are mitotic heritable, they can permanently alter future generation's epigenome whose outcome are unknown.</p></div>
