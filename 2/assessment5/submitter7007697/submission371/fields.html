    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell,  CpG islands are unmethylated, and it is necessary to avoid the silencing of gene expression. However, in a cancer cell it is found high levels of methylations at CpG islands, this is called hypermethylation. This epigenetic aberration can silencing tumour supressor genes, because the methylations at CpG islands create the repressive chromatine structure which inhibits the transcription of that genes. It is very common to find CIMP phenotype in cancers.<br /><br />In a normal cell, intergenetic regions and repetitive elements are methylated, their function is to maintain genomic integrity. On the contrary, in a cancer cell these regions are hypomethylated, it means that methylations levels are reduced. This epigenetics abnormality  lead to genomic instability, because of chromatine is not packaged. For that reason, recombinations, transpositions and activations of some cryptic prometers are more frequent and stimulate tumour development.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/igf2 cluster is an example of imprinted controlled region by enhancer blocking. The methylation pattern is different between paternal and maternal alleles. In a normal cell, the paternal allel has got H19 methylated, this gene is not expressed and the enhancers activates the transcriptions of Igf2. However, the maternal allele has not got H19 methylated, this gens is expressed and the enhancers join to CTCF and do not activate Ifg2 expression. <br /><br />In Wilm's tumour it is found an hypermethylation at H19 region, in consequence the maternal allele is methylated too, there is overexpression of Igf2 and a dosage decompensation. This alters cell function and leads to cancer.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA demethlylating agent, its function is to inhibite DNA methyltransferase, so this drug contributes to reduce DNA methylations. This ability is used in case of tumour. As we know, some epigenteics aberrations as hypermethylations lead to tumour, so is important to reduce this increase and get again the normal epigentic marks.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alteration of  DNA methylation, as any other epigenetic change, is passed on during cell division to daughter cells and granddaughter cells... Until they are actively erased during sensitive periods. It is called a senstive period when all epigenetic marks are almost clear, it is necessary between generations to restore totipotency, and finally cleared cells are epigentic reprogrammed. There are two sensitive period: pre-implantation early development period, even after birth, and primordial germ cell development. Both periods are shown to vary DNA methylations level.<br /><br />It is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive perdiods because the drug effect<span> would interfere with reprogramming period. In consequence, it would modificate the methylations pattern, and remain in all progeny cells. This aberration could be the cause of many diseases.</span><br /><br /></div>
