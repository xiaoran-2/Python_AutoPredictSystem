    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>    Regions
with a high frequency of repetitive CG sequence (CpG islands) are located mainly
at promoters of genes. Since adding methyl groups to a cytosines  in such regions cause downregulation of a
gene, this mechanism is used in cell differentiation (tissue-specific regulation of the gene).
Besides, DNA methylation at CpG islands  contributes
to X inactivation and laying down genomic imprinting. </span></p><p><span>    In cancer both hiper- and hypomethylation of CpG islands
can be found. Hypermethylation in CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes causes
loss of function, therefore control of a cel cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair are
distrupted in cancer cells. Hypomethylation on the other hand activates
proto-oncogens (so called gain of function) which leads to increased
proliferation and cancerogenesis.  </span></p><p>



</p><p><span>    Methylation
also occurs in repetitive elements and intergenic regions, where it provides
maintenance of genomic stability. Cancer cells shows demethylation of these
regions. It leads to activation of transposable elements or cryptic promoters
that distrupt neighbouring genes. Besides, an illegitimate recombination
between repeats can take place, resulting in chromosomal aberrations such as
deletions, duplications or reciprocal translocations. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>     Differently
methylated ICRs (Imprinted control regions) can contribute to cancer as it might
cause loss of imprinting. This can result in downregulation of growth
restricting genes or upregulation of growth promoting genes. </p><p>     An example of imprinting is a H19/Igf2 cluster. Normally ICR is methylated in paternal allele and stays unmethyleted on maternal allele. Lack
of methylation at ICR on maternal allele enables binding of an insulator
protein. It makes Igf2 gene unaccessible for downstream enhancers which then affect only H19 gene. On the contrary on
paternal allele both ICR and H19 promoter are methylated. It blocks the
expression of H19 gene and prevents from CTCF binding. If there is no CTCF bound
to ICR, enhencers are able to activate Igd2 gene. </p><p>    Since in Wilm’s tumor CTCF
binding site is hypermethylated, Igf2 is expressed from both alleles. This
promotes increased cellular proliferation which leads to tumorigenesis. </p><span> </span><span><br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>     In terms of
therapeutic class Decitabine is described as DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase
inhibitor). It provides DNMT-depleting action as it is a chemical analogue of
citosine that is able to irreversibly bind DNMTs. This epigenetic drug used in
myelodysplastic syndromes is a hypomethylating agent that inhibits DNA
methyltransferase. It is thought that by hypomethylating DNA Decitabine increases
expression of downregulated (hypermethylated) tumor suppressor genes that present antiproliferative activity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>      Altering DNA
methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome as the methylation marks
are mitotically heritable. Once established, pattern of methylation is sustained
in daughter DNA strands by DNMT1, until they are actively erased. Epigenetic
reprogramming (clearing of epigenetic marks) occurs during early embryonic
development and germ cells developement. Those are the sensitive periods when distrupted
epigenetic reprogramming (restoring of methylation pattern) can cause long-lasting
effects. Therefore treating young patents with drugs that target epigenetic
machinery carries a risk because we must consider possibility of affecting
developing germ cells.   </p></div>
