    <div class="field-value">CpG Islands are C,G rich regions usually occurs at upstream of a gene. DNA methylation at CpG Islands normally <b>silence</b> the respective gene. <br /><br />Generally CpG island methylation increases in cancer cells compared to normal cells. In cancer, tumor suppressor genes are silenced due to <br />CpG  island methylation on tumor suppressor genes. So normal cells are in the way of uncontrolled cell division, one of the hall mark of cancer. <br /><br />Intergenic elements are methylated because to check cryptic transcription sites and splice sites, otherwise transcription of a gene will be defective.<br /><br />Repetitive elements should be methylated inorder to prevent transposition of repeats in to various position of the genome, which leads to mutation and affects normal gene expression. <br /><br />In cancer intergenic elements and repetitive elements are unmethylated.<br /><br />Demethylation at intergenic regions will leads to activate the cryptic transcription active sites. Cryptic sites are found in opposite direction to a specific gene promoter. It might be present by chance are might be associated with other genes. Active cryptic sites attract RNA polymerase. As a result the transcription of a specific gene will disrupt. again failing of tumor suppressor genes leads to uncontrolled cell division. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">hypermethylation of imprint control regions play  a critical role.  it is a common event and often occurs in pre neoplastic tissue. in H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region, for example is mythylated in paternal allele and is unmethylated in maternal allele. In meternal allele CTCF binds to the unmethylated region and intern leads to the activsation of H19 and Igf2 will be silenced. But in the paternal allele, the enhancers acts on Igf2 and H19 will be silenced. <br />But in Willm's tumour because of the hypermethylation of the paternal as well as meternal allele, the Igf2 is actively expressed in both alleles. This Igf2 is a growth promotor it will leads to the promotion of cell divition above the nomal level. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to "DNA-demethylating agent".<br />Decitabine Acts as a demethylation agent and it unmethylate the regions of DNA.<br />Decitabine is a epigenitic modifier, than acts as a DNA-demethylating agent. It reverse the DNA methylation pattern to normal. This switches genes on and off by alters the proteins needed to transcribe the gene. This control of gene activation or silencing is mostly achieved by epigeniticmeans. In cancer cells some regions are hypermethylated than the normal cells. Decitabine Acts as a demethylation agent and it reverse the effect of cancer cells by demethylating its DNA.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Generally CpG island methylation increases in cancer cells compared to 
normal cells. In cancer, tumor suppressor genes are silenced due to <br />CpG  island methylation on tumor suppressor genes. So normal cells are in the way of uncontrolled cell division, one of the hall mark of cancer. Demethylation at intergenic regions will leads to activate the cryptic 
transcription active sites. Cryptic sites are found in opposite 
direction to a specific gene promoter. It might be present by chance are
 might be associated with other genes. Active cryptic sites attract RNA 
polymerase. As a result the transcription of a specific gene will 
disrupt. again failing of tumor suppressor genes leads to uncontrolled 
cell division. <br /><br />sensitive period is a critical period in the developemet of the zygote in which DNA methlation patterns are actively in change. Early development stage and Primordial germ cell development stage are the examples of the sensitive period.<br /><br /></div>
