    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are usually
     unmethylated as they are located near gene promotors. Hypermethylation of
     CpG islands results in unmethylated genes or if the CpG islands are
     hypomethylated then the gene becomes methylated. Hypermethylation results
     in loss of expression for tumour suppressor genes or hypomethylation may
     result in over expression of Oncogens or growth factors which can influence tumours in either direction. Intergenic
     regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated to maintain genomic
     integrity or silence cryptic transcription sites but in the case of Hypermethylation/hypomethylation
     it can result in deletions, translocations and insertions due to genomic
     instability.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele Lgf2 is expressed via enhancers due
to CTFC not being insulated but on the maternal allele CTCF is insulated which
activates H19 but stops the enhancing activation of Lgf2. In Wilms tumours the
maternal allele is methylated as well as the paternal allele resulting in no
insulation and an over expression of Igf2 which is a growth promotor causing kidney tumours to develop in childhood.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is an analogue for a DNA - demethylating agent used to treat
rare illnesses like cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Decitabine hypomethylates the DNA
by inhibiting DNMT1. Decitabine can only be incorporated into the DNA strands
and its mechanisms are still unclear but it may act on activating tumour
suppressor genes along the entire epigenome where certain genes may have been
silenced.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes can be mitotically heritable which means
it can be passed on to dividing cells like daughter cells and granddaughter cells
etc. This means the drugs will have a lasting effect after the treatment
period. During pre-implantation and germ cell development the genome undergoes
a reprograming stage. These 2 stages are referred to as sensitive periods of
development as interutirine environment, maternal diet and various other
factors have a huge impact on epigenetic reprogramming. Hypomethylating agents
could have a huge effect on the embryo if the patient is pregnant and is
currently taking the medication through these sensitive periods of development.</p></div>
