    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption

    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.</li></ul>In normal somatic mammalian cells CpG islands are usually methylation free, regardless of the gene activity.  <br />The methylation level is mitotically heritable.<br /><ul><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer</li></ul>In cancer cells methylation of CpG islands is often observed.  Hypermethylation in CpG island in a gene promoter causes the gene transcriptional silencing.<ul><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.</li></ul>Hypermitilation of CpG islands and shores in cancer cells can cause tumour suppressor genes deactivation.<br /><br /><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</li></ul>In intergenic regions and repetitive of a normal cell DNA methylation  is a heritable epigenetic mark. Repit regions are often silenced by hypermethylation. Hypomethylation  in some intragenic regions contribute to neighboreing genes transcription activity by interacting  with transcription machinery, and can be cell lineage specific. <br /><ul><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.</li></ul>Genome-wide demethylation is characteristic of cancer cells. It is mostly observed in repetitive elements, normally methylated in all cell lineages. <br /><ul><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.</li></ul>Demethylation of repetitive elements contributes to DNA instability by activation of the repetitive elements. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.</li></ul>Igf2 is a paternally expressed oncogene. In paternal DNA, insulation protein CTCF doesn't bind and methylation spreads to H19 promoter silencing it. It allows allowing upstream enhancers region to activate lgf2 transcription. <br /><br /><ul><li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.  <br /></li></ul>In maternal DNA, CTCF protein doesn't binds, insulating  H19 promoter 
from methylation. H19 is active. The effect of upstream enhancers doesn't spread to the maternal allele of lgf2, which is not expressed.<ul><li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.  <br /></li></ul>In Wilm's tumour, both maternal and paternal  H19/Igf2 clusters are demythelated. Both lgf2 alleles are active.<br /><ul><li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        </li></ul>Activation of both lgf2 alleles result in double production of insulin-like growth hormone 
comparing with normal somatic cells. It contributes to abnormal cell 
growth.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>

        epigenome.

    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.

        epigenome. <br /></li></ul>DNA methylathyon is mitotically heritable in somatic cells, contributing to cell delineation.
