    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are hypomethylated in normal cells. Hypermethylation of CpG islands silences tumor suppressor genes. Then, the gen is unable to stop uncontrolled cell growth, causing cancer. However, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in normal cells. Genome-wide hypomethylation (mainly related to intergenic regions and repetitive elements) causes genome instability that could involve deletions, reciprocal translocations or insertions, giving an abnormal karyotype. These alterations could enhance tumorigenesis. <br />Therefore, DNA methylation could enhance or suppress tumorigeneis, depending on the tissue involved in the cancer: depletion of DNA methylation should result in tumorigenesis suppression in cancer generated by tumour suppressor hypermethylation, whereas it should enhance tumorigenesis in cancer caused by chromosomal instability.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cluster H19/Igf2 is an example of how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer. ICR in paternal allele is methylated and DNA methylation at ICR blocks CTCF insulator protein binding at ICR and it enables downstream enhancers to act on Igf2 and it can be expressed. On the other hand, ICR is unmethylated on maternal allele and CTCF insulator element binds ICR. Therefore, enhancers are free to act on H19 long non coding RNA and Igf2 gene is silent because CTCF is insulating Igf2 from enhancers. However in Wilm´s tumour, ICR is also methylated in maternal allele and enhancers can act on Igf2 and it can be expressed. So, double dose of Igf2 can be expressed in parental alleles (normal paternal + abnormal maternal). As Igf2 is a growth promoting factor, it helps cell uncontrolled replication in kidney Wilm´s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic síndromes that are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. This drug causes DNA hypomethylation in hypermethylated tumor-suppressed genes and leads to epigenetic reactivation of these genes. Then, it results in tumorigenesis suppression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic changes are heritable and are passed on during cell división to daughter cells. It must be taken into account that there are sensitive periods of development when there must be wariness in treating patients with such drugs. Young patients before puberty, should not be treated (however, survival of patient is the first priority) with this kind of drugs because they have not selective, but systemic effects in different tissues. It could have negative effects on germ cell development in the younger patients.</div>
