    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands controls the expression of genes by silencing
gene expression, either by impeding the binding of transcriptional proteins or
by chromatin remodeling to create compact chromatin (heterochromatin). In
normal cells some CpG islands for cancer suppressor genes are not methylated allowing
the nearby genes to be expressed.</p><p>As cancer develops the amount of CpG island methylation increases (CpG island
hypermethylation). Which CpG islands are hypermethylated varies with the type
of tumor and is locus specific.</p><p>Hypermethylation at CpG islands contributes to the silencing of tumor
suppressor genes allowing the cancer tumor to develop. Since hypermethylation
is mitotically heritable the daughter cells of cancer cells will also have
silenced tumor suppressor genes so cancer cells will continue to proliferate
over multiple generations. If the Knudson hypothesizes is true, CpG island
methylation could be one of the multiple errors resulting in cancer.</p><p>Normally intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to prevent
their transcription and other interactions (for example to prevent recombination
at repeats).</p><p>In normal cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are
methylated. In cancer cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are
less methylated (hypomethylated). The hypomethylation increases over time (i.e.
the methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements decreases over
time).</p><p><span>Exposure of repeats with
the loss of methylation increases recombination due to loss of heterochrmatin
packaging and alignment of the repeats. The repeats can also be transcribed and
transpose into other positions in the genome.</span><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In paternal allele the ICR is methylated blocking the binding of CTFC to
the ICR. The methylation also spreads to the start of the H19 sequence. Without
CTFC bound to the ICR the downstream enhancers increase the expression of the
Igf2 gene.</p><p> In maternal genes the ICR is not methylated allowing the binding of CTFC to
the ICR which insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers resulting instead in
their enhancing H19 expression and inactive expression of Igf2.</p><p>In cells within Wilm’s
tumor the maternal ICR region is hypermethylated resulting in the loss of
imprinting (due to CTCF not being able to bind to the ICR) so that the maternal
allele is active in the generation of Igf2. Ifg2 is overexpressed since both
allels are active. <br /></p><p><span>Igf2 is growth promoting so
the double expression of Igf2 results in the excessive growth of kidney cells
resulting in Wilm’s tumor.</span><br /></p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. Decitabine might be able to
decrease histone overmethylation in cancer cells (assuming that it has effects
similar to the DNA-demethylating agents GSK2816126 and JQ1). By decreasing
histone overmethylation Decitabine might be able to prevent the silencing of
tumor-suppressor genes. Since at least some DNA-demethylating agents are able
to erase the epigenetic changes that result in tumor cell proliferation, it
could possibly reprogram the daughter cells of dividing tumor cells so they
will not continue to proliferate (or even die through apogenisis or by removing
the silencing of some of the tumor suppressor genes make the treated cells more
susceptible to other cancer treatments).</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable changes in DNA methylation
are also mitotically heritable. Therefore, a treatment that changes or
reprograms the DNA methylation of a parent cell will pass on these changes to
its daughter cells (and their daughter cells...) even after the treatment is discontinued. </span></p><p><span>Sensitive periods in
Epigenetics are the periods in which epigenetic reprogramming in ongoing, such
as during germ cell development and early embryonic development. During the
sensitive periods the normal epigenetic programming is removed through demethylation and the
rebuilt by DNA methylation (including removal of imprinting and new imprinting during germ cell
development). If DNA methylation altering drugs are used to treat the patient
during a sensitive period (either germ cell development in the patientthe early development of an embryo the patient is carrying it
could prevent the normal reprogramming of the epigenetic markers resulting in
either decreased viability of an embryo (if the treatment is given to a
pregnant female) or even possible multi-generational changes caused by epigenetic
changes in the gametes generated from the germ cells.</span></p></div>
