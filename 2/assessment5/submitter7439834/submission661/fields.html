    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are short segments of the genome with high density of CpG (cytosine-guanine) sequence.These islands are generally not methylated. If methylation occurs at the CpG site it functions to make the island a heterochromatic structure - this means the DNA in this sequence is not expressed. The main function of CpG islands is controlling expression of a co-located gene - that is to say that if the island is methylated then it cannot promote the adjacent gene, and an unmethylated island will allow the gene to be expressed. <br /><br />In cancer the CpG island often has increased methylation (hypermethylation) at CpG sites. This results in the adjacent gene not being expressed. If this is a gene which would make cancer less likely (tumor suppressor gene) then the silencing of the CpG island results in inactivation of a tumour suppressor gene. An example would be a pro-apoptotic gene.<br /><br />DNA methylation at repetitive elements provides structural stability - this decreases the likelihood of mutations during DNA replication. In cancer these regions may be hypomethylated. These elements are now more likely to bind to identical repetitive elements located in other parts of the genome, which would increase the incidence of translocations between chromosomes - illegitimate recombination. Translocations can change gene expression by altering promoter regions or by disrupting the expressed sequence itself. <br /><br />Intergenic regions are non-coding segments of DNA between coding regions. Like repetitive elements these intergenic regions can promote structural stability although they also can as promoter regions and produce non-coding RNA. If a promotor region is initially hypermethylated then loses it methylation, as is common in intergenic regions in cancer, then the result can be inappropriate activation or silencing of the gene which is promoted by this intergenic region, which may be an oncogene or tumour suppressor gene and result in malignant change.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region(ICR) of the healthy paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 gene is methylated. The means that CTCF, which is an insulator protein that prevents expression of IGF2, cannot bind to the H19 ICR and as a result the paternal Igf2 is not insulated and is thus expressed.<br /><br />The implant control region of the healthy maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 gene is not methylated. Thus CTCF can bind to the ICR, and blocks expression of the Igf2 on the maternal allele. Hence maternal Igf2 is not expressed.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour the maternal ICR is hypermethylated, and as a result insulator protein CTCF cannot bind, and maternal Igf2 is no longer silenced, this Igf2 is expressed in addition to paternal Igf2. Therefore the patient gets twice as much Igf2 as they would have otherwise. Igf2 is a growth promoter and an excess contributes to the development of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylating agent, with the specific mechanism of being a DNA methyl-transferase inhibitor. This means that during mitosis Decitabine binds irreversibly with DNA methyl transferase which would otherwise methylate the new strand of DNA. Therefore Decitabine stops DNA from being methylated, and as a result the level of methylation decreases. This is relevant given the high rate of CPG island hypermethylation which occurs in cancer, particularly leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome in the context of Decitabine use.<br /><br />Decreasing methylation has an anti-tumour effect as CpG island hypermethylation is common in leukaemia as a mechanism of silencing tumour suppressor genes. If these CpG islands are demethylated then the tumour suppressor gene is no longer silent and can once again express their proteins which act to decrease the malignant nature of the leukemia eg decreasing rate of cell division.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable change in expression of DNA. Once DNA methylation is present in a cell it continues to be present in daughter cells of the original cell, as well as their daughter cells. The action of these medications takes away methylation from the cell's DNA, and those methyl groups do not return after the medication has been ceased. Subsequent daughter cells will not spontaneously revert back to methylated DNA in nucleotides which lost their methylation.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a time of development in which most original epigenetic marks have been erased, and are being formed again in a different pattern in accordance with developmental and external factors. The two periods of development with the most epigenetic re-programming are gametogenesis (when the parental sperm and egg are being formed) and early embryonic development.<br /><br />Treating patients with demethylating agents during sensitive periods of development is inadvisable because the DNA is in the process of developing epigenetic markers, including methylation, which are tightly controlled by developmental and environmental factors to result in correct differentiation of cells. Changes in this period may result in failure of differentiation of cells and incorrect development of the gametes and fetus respectively.<br /></div>
