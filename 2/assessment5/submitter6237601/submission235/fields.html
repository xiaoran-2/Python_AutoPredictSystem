    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><b>In normal cells</b>, the  CpG island, are in
general  free of methylation, while through intergenic regions, at
the repetitive elements and even at the introns of the genes, the CpG
dinucleotides are methylated. The function of that methylation is to silence
the repeats in order to prevent transposition as well as illegitimate
recombination between repeats, and also to silence strong constitutional or
cryptic promoters to prevent  transcriptional interference. All that to maitain genomic stability.<br /></p><p><b>In cancer cell</b> in general  the global level of DNA
methylation decrease when moving progressively  from normal tissue up to
 metastatic tissue. Conversely the methylation at the CpG island
become more and more dense. </p><p><span>As  CpG island occur in
general at promoters of the genes,  when  the promter of a  "tumour
suppressor gene" is <b>hypermethylated</b> 
it will be sileced.  This epimutation can be then one of the several
required <b>hits</b>,
that according to Knudson hypothesis, are needed to initiate tumour genesis.</span></p><p><span>Also the  <b>hypomethylation</b> at
the intergenic regions and at repetitive elements are a common epigenetic
control aberrations in cancer. The lost of methylation at these regions
 leads to genomic instability (for the reasons already mentioned above
when referring to normal cells)  and the subsequent production of partial
deletion of  chromosomes, insertions and reciprocal translocations between
chromosomes, </span></p><p><span>Less common in cancer is the <b> hypomethylation</b> of CpG poor promoter (a promoter having too few CpG dinucleotides to be considered a CpG island). In normal cells these few CpG nucleotides are methylated and
then its associated gene is silenced. The </span><b>hypomethylation</b>   these CpG poor promoter  may result in the expression of the associated genes  disrupting  into different types of cancer.</p><p>









</p><p>As DNA methylation is mitotically
hereditable, methylation epigenetic control disruptions are a  very
effective epimutation  to contribute to induce tumour genesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes, are genes that display mono-allelic
parent-of-origin-specific expression. The loss of imprinting is a common
disruption in cancer cells, manifested either by the expression of both
parental alleles or the silencing of both parental alleles.</p><p>In the particular case of  the
H19/Igf2 cluster the Igf2 gene is a paternally imprinted gene and for that reason
its Imprinted Control Region (ICR) is methylated and conversely the ICR at the
maternal chromosome is unmethylated. The expression of Igf2 at the paternal
allele is  promoted by enhancers located downstream the ICR,  while
the expression of the maternal Igf2  is silence because the promotion of
the downstream enhancer is blocked by a  CTCF insulator protein bounded
 at the unmethylated  ICR.</p><p><span>If the ICR of the maternal chromosome
 is methylated, the insulator CTCF is released and the downstream
enhancers are  able to promote the expression of the maternal Igf2. So
now, there is a double dose of Igf2 compared with normal cell. As Igf2 is
growth promoting gene this loss of imprinting disrupt in a tumor known as
Wilm’s tumour, a particular childhood
kidney tumour.</span></p><p>





</p><p>The H19 gene has not being considered in
the discussion because is not related to the described disruption.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dicitabine is an epigenetic enzymatic inhibitor, that is, a small
molecule  targeted to inhibit a particular enzyme of the epigenetic
machinery. Dicitabine is a methyltransferse inhibitor already approved by FDA,
for use in myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed into acute myeloid
leukemia (AML). Dicitabine is a nucleoside analog molecule, that is
incorporated into DNA upon replication. When DNA methyltransferse (DNMT1) bind
that nucleotide in order to methylate the hemi-methylated daughter strand, it
is no longer released. Successive cells divisions dilute progressively the
DNA methylation. In principle that occur in all cells, but as cancer cells
proliferate more rapidly the demethylation is more effective in the tumour
cells. Dicitabine seems to be particularly effective in myelodysplastic
syndrome because a hall mark of this type of cancer is CpG island
hypermethylation.<br /></p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drugs that alter the DNA methylation may have effects lasting
beyond the period of drug treatment because the DNA methylation state is
mitotically heritable, in other words, epigenetic changes are passed on
during cell division to daughter cells.<br /></p><p>Sensitive periods are those during
which the epigenome can be disrupted by environmental factors, including
prenatal and early-life development, in particular during germ cell development
in young patients. Two important sensitive periods during embryo development
are, early embryo development and  primordial germ cell
development in which important epigenetic reprogramming occur.</p><p>



</p><p><span>The use, during sensitive periods, of
drugs  that inhibits enzymatic regulators
of the epigenetic machinery may result in very large insult to the epigenome of the patient.</span></p></div>
