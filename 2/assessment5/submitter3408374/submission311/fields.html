    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are regions of the DNA with a predominance of Cytosine - Guanine pairs (p stands for the phosphate links), which are often found at the promoters of genes. In genes which are expressed, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated. But cancer cells are likely to show hypermethylation, an unusally large amount of methylation, of the CpG islands.  This hypermethylation silences or impedes transcription. This effect is mitotically heritable. If the promoters of tumour suppressor genes are methylated; these genes are silenced and cancers can grow. CpG island hypermethylation and associated gene silencing occurs very commonly in all sorts of cancers.<br /><br />Whereas CpG islands are commonly not methylated, methylation is the norm at repetitive and intergenic regions throughout the genome. In cancer, however, these regions tend to be hypomethylated (methyl groups removed). Genome-wide hypomethylation (except at CpG islands) is another feature commonly found in all sorts of tumours. DNA methylation in the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are important for cell stability, and they act against chromosomal abnormalities. Heavy methylization and the binding nature of heterochromatin normally prevents alleles of different chromosomes from coming together and having reciprocal transcriptions, for example. When the repetitive elements and intergenic material is hypomethalated, the chromatin opens up and the genes are less densely packaged and more liable to intermix and change. Increased genomic instability is characteristic of cancer.<br /><br />Thus hypermethylation at CpG islands and hypomethylation at repeats and intergenic regions, are both part of the cancer process.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2, insulin-like growth factor 2, is a paternally expressed imprinted gene which is important in embryonic development. Usually it would be methylated on the paternal allele and non-methylated on the maternal allele. When the cluster in non-methylated,on the maternal allele the action of binding factor CTCF allows enhancers to act on H19, but Igf2 is not expressed. On the paternal allele, where the Igf2 cluster is methylated, the enhancers can act on Igf2, because CTCF is not binding to inhibit this reaction, and IGF2 is expressed. <br /><br />If imprinting is lost, both the maternal and the paternal alleles will produce Igf2, rather than only the paternal allele, so there is excessive production of the growth-promoting Igf2. This excess Igf2 is associated with the childhood kidney disease, Wilm's tumour.<br /><br />H19 is maternally expressed in normal imprinting. H19 generally restricts growth and Igf2 promotes growth, so it is not very surprisingly that abnormal expression of these genes due to disruption of imprinting has been found in other cancers as well.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />Decitabine is an DNA-demethylating agent (more precisely a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor), an epigentic drug already being used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (which can lead to acute myelogenous leukaemia). A feature of this type of cancer is the hypermethylization of CpG islands and the subsequent silencing of tumour suppressive genes. So if you can remove this excess hypermethylization, you give tumour suppressent genes a chance to act against the cancer. Decibitabine inhibits the action of an enzyme DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt1. Decibatine is analogous to a nucleoside so it gets incorporated in the DNA on replication. When Dnmt1 binds to the nucleotide then its activity is suppressed.  Although this can affect all cells, it has the strongest action on cancer cells because they are dividing more rapidly than normal cells and their DNA is replicating more rapidly..<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />Drugs have side-effects as well as intended effects. Decisions have to be made as to the lesser <br />of two evils; the harm done by the drugs vs. the harm done by the disease. The severity of the disease, the patient's age, and the effectiveness of other treatments all have to be considered. Treatments for cancer often are toxic to normal cells as well as to cancer cells, but because cancer cells reproduce rapidly chemotherapy will hit cancerous cells harder than other cells.<br /><br />DNA methylation is altered in cancer cells. The changes are mitotically heritable. Cancer cells proliferate, passing on these changes. Epigentic drugs which target DNA methylation can also cause endurable heritable changes.  For younger patients we especially have to think of enduring long-term effects, and also that patients may be more strongly affected by the drugs if they are still growing, still in a sensitive stage of development. We would especially worry with young people about changes to germ cells..And there would be concern for women of childbearing age, as a developing fetus would be very sensitive to the biochemical environment. Periods of germ cell development and early embryonic development are times when cells are most subject to reprogramming, <br /><br /></div>
