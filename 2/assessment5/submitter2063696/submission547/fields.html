    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normal cells have hypomethylated CpG islands while repetitive elements, intergenic region and intrans are methylated. Cancer cells have CpG islands more likely to be methylated while repetitive elements, intergenic region and intrans are hypomethylated. DNA methylation of CpG islands leads to genetic mutation silencing tumour supressor genes in cancer and is mitotically heritable. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements maintains genetic stability, but in cancer both suffer hypomethylation. The intergenic regions become misaligned and illegimate recombination can occur because they are not densed packed down into heterochromatine. Repeats can make a copy of themselves and jump around the genome or transpose and activate neighboring genes. So they cause genomic instability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele of the H19/lgf2 cluster the ICR is methylated so the Enhancers will act on lgf2 and not on the H19 that is silenced. But if the maternal allele has lgf2 silenced, the Enhancers will act on H19. But if both maternal and paternal alleles have hypermethylation of both ICRs, we have loss of imprinting and in both alleles we have expression of lgf2. That's a double lgf2 dose that is a growth promoting and this is an event associated with Wilm's tumour. Hypo or hypermethylation at ICRs can result in loss of expression or overexpression of growth restricting genes which can lead to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that hypomethylates DNA by inhibing DNA methyltransferase. It's incorporated into DNA strands. Sold as Dacogen it is a drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, a class of conditions where certain blood cells are dysfunctional, and for acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine is azacitidine's deoxy derivative. According to the article, a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. It was the first time epigenetic drugs had been deployed successfully against a solid tumour. These tumours are harder to treat because the drug has to penetrate them.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because once the marks are done they go on by mitotically division.<br />According to the article epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to generation after generation of cells until the tumour cells are actively erased. Once erased they don't return. So, it's possible that epigenetic therapies can effect enduring changes stopping cancer growth without to kill all its cells.<br />Periods of epigenetic reprogramming are sensitive periods. They are the period of production of germ cells until the maturity formation of egg or sperm and the pre-implantation and early post-implantation period of the embryo.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods could lead to negative epigenetic effects because in this periods germ cells are not methylated and are being reprogrammed.<br /></div>
