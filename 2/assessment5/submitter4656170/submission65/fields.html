    <h1>Submission 65 from Anon (session_user_id: 81b11a6887b009de33eff54882be237ebc3a6cbb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dna methylation is mithotically heritable, thus, any effect on it is transmitted on all cells deriving thru mithosis. Due to that mechanism alterations of epigenome at  DNA methilation level can have enduring effects.  A sensitive period is a period in ealy life when there is a high sensitivity to the effects of epigenetic regulations.<br />Typically sensitive periods are in early embryionic period and in germ cell development. Any treatment during those phases are at high risk of producing unplanned side effects</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG island are regions of DNA where methilation or unmethilation have often a direct effect as suppressor or promoter of gene expression. In normal DNA we find overall more methylation (genome wide) but less methylation on CpG islands. Methilation at Cpg Islands in tumor has a tumor repressor inibhition effect . That, coupled with an overall hypomethilation that in general has a positive effect on gene expression,, leads to cancer. On the contrary hypermethilation of repetitive elements gives to the genome a high grade of stability. Hypomethilation at repetitive elements ledas to illegitimate recombination and to transposition both clearly cancerogenic factors.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinted genes are often involved in growth mechanisms. Thus any alteration in their control regions (ICR) is likely to have a cancerogenic effect.in H19/Igf2 cluster  ICR is methilated on paternal allele and unmethilated in maternal allele. Unmethilated ICR links CTCF that "insulates" the upstream region where Igf2 is from enhancers that act on H19 instead. Methilation of ICR, on the contrary, leads at the end to the expression of Igf2 due to the absence of CTCF screening effect.<br />In Wilm's tumor also the maternal allele is methylated producing a double expression of Igf2 that, being a growth promoter, is one of the factors that leads to that particular kind of tumor</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, contained in Dacogen by Eisai, is a DNMTi (inhibithor of DNA methil transferase). The inhibition of DNMT makes more difficult the methilation of DNA. As we now know, cancer DNA is heavely methilated at CpG islands. The drugs makes the methylation of new dividing cells more difficult thus making more difficult the propagation of DNA CpG Hyper methilation</div>
