    <h1>Submission 161 from Anon (session_user_id: e3816b801b4900b807030d65c82cc423a7b9d52c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation has a direct affect on the level of gene expression. <br /><br />CpG islands are normally hypomethylated, but become hypermethylated in the case of cancer. Conversely, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally hypermethylated but become hypomethylated in the case of cancer. These changes are associated with activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Normally, paternal allele shows hypermythelation of imprint control region whereas maternal allele shows hypomythelation of imprint control region. <br /><br />Epigenetic changes in DNA, such as hypomethylation or hypermethylation, can result in overexpression of growth promoting genes or loss of expression of growth restricting genes.</div><div><br />For example, hypermethylation of the imprint control region associated to the H19/Igf2 cluster allows the enhances to increase Igf2 expression. When this takes place on the maternal allele, it results in overexpression of <span>Igf2</span> and Wilm’s tumour.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent (e.g. remove methyl groups). It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which are precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia by shutting down <i>Myc</i>-activated genes and slowing the proliferation of myeloma cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes in DNA methylation can have enduring effects since they are mitotically heritable.<br /><br />A sensitive period is when the epigenetic marks are being reprogrammed such as in germ <br />cells and early embryonic development.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable as it can lead to imprinting disorders where 2 maternal or 2 paternal alleles are expressed.</div>
