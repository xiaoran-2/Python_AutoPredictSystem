<div><span>DNA 
methylation occurs mainly in regions called CpG islands. It occurs 
mainly during embryogenesis. In a normal cell, DNA 
is not very methylated. <span>The 
presence of a methyl group in fact prevents the interaction between the gene and 
the transcription factors.<br /></span>Cancer may affect the 
DNA methylation. An 
oncogene, for example, by inactivating a tumor suppressor gene can cause an 
increase in methylation. Conversely, 
an increase in DNA methylation can promote the occurrence of cancer. 
The 
hypermethylation silenced tumor suppressor genes. <span>They 
can no longer restrain tumor growth.<br /></span>In 
normal cells, the genome is generally repetitive elements methylated in 
inter-genic regions and the introns. In 
contrast, in a cancer cell, are the CpG islands that are methylated in a normal 
cell. <span>And 
the rest of the genome, including the repetitive elements of these inter-genic 
regions and introns, rather are hypomethylated.<br /></span>This 
hypomethylation promote illegitimate recombination and reciprocal 
translocations. <span>When 
these inter-genic regions are methylated, such recombination can not 
occur.<br /></span>In 
a normal cell, DNA is also too densely packed so that the recombination occurs. 
While 
in a cancer cell, the hypomethylation of repetitive elements or intergenic 
regions open chromatin. <span>The 
genome can then jump or transpose, with outliers.<br /></span></span><p><br /></p></div></div></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<div><span>With the cluster H19/Igf2, 
we have a </span>imprint control region specific. <br /><span>And it is methylated on the paternal allele and is unmethylated on the maternal allele. <br />The paternal allele because it is methylated, reduced amplifiers. <br />Igf2 is silent for the maternal allele and we do not see his expression. <br />However, with the loss of the </span>imprint, there is hypermethylation of the control region on the maternal allele. <br /><span>In the case of cancer, there is also the expression of Igf2 the maternal allele and hence a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell. <br />Igf2 is a growth stimulant. It is associated with Wilms tumors, 
which are tumors of 
the kidney in children. <br />The loss of print is observed in many tumor types. <br />It occurs very early in development, and is therefore often in neoplastic tissues.</span></div></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<div><span>The Decitabine appears to be a drug that helps to hypomethylation. It therefore fight against hypermethylation responsible cancers. Methylation is a process wherein a methyl group (CH3) 
is added to the DNA. 
Abnormal hypermethylation silenced genes and is associated with the development of many types of cancers. The Decitabine causes hypomethylation in cancer cells and may help to cancel hypermethylation induced by cancer. The goal is to restore normal gene function, which is essential for healthy cells and the entire body. It is an epigenetic drug of the class of DNA-demethylating <span>agents.</span></span></div></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<div><span>The 
DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome because it created a 
new balance / imbalance in the functions of the cell. <span>Epigenetic 
modifications are transmitted during cell division the daughter and 
granddaughter of cells until they are actively erased.<br /></span>Sensitive 
periods are periods of time during which the nervous system is more responsive 
to certain environmental stimuli, allowing it to connect more particularly 
certain neurons them. They 
are particularly present during the embryonic development, in childhood and 
adolescence. It is at these 
times that learning can take place. This 
concept is linked to the neuronal plasticity which is the basis of the 
adaptation of the brain. Thus, 
neural plasticity is possible but within these critical periods. These 
theories developed primarily in the 1970s are highly nuanced and challenged by 
recent discoveries in neurobiology. <span>Periods 
of learning that can last a lifetime.<br /></span>The 
treatment of patients during sensitive periods would not be desirable because 
the side effects are too poorly known. The findings are 
recent and certainly incomplete. <span>Hypomethylation 
of DNA, even desirable, may cause other types of cancer and premature 
aging.<br /></span><span>Perhaps 
the best prevention epigenetics is in a healthy lifestyle and environmental 
best, away from pollutants?</span></span></div></div></div>
