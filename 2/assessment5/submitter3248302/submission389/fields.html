    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is an Epigenetic marker in which the 5-carbon of cytosine at a CpG site is methylated, causing tighter binding between the DNA molecule and the histones on which it is spooled. <br />Most CpG sites are located in repetitive elements, and intergenic regions, which constitute most of the mammalian genome. Normally these sites are heavily methylated, which causes them to be densely packaged in heterochromatin, and generally prevents interference from those elements in the genome.</div><div>CpG islands, which are long stretches rich in CpG sequences, are relatively rarer in the genome, but appear in 60% of gene promoters. These are normally hypomethylated (non-methylated) allowing the corresponding genes to be expressed. </div><div>In cancer we find that CpG islands tend to be methylated, in particular in tumor suppressor genes, thus causing dense chromatin packaging, silencing these genes, preventing their expression, so that when combined with other disruptive factors may result in unrestricted growth. Tumor suppressors normally restrict excess growth in somatic cells or enable apoptosis of damaged cells. </div><div>Conversely, the normally silent repetitive elements and transposable elements found in the intergenic regions of the genome, which are normally silenced, are found to be hypomethylated in cancerous tissues. The loss of methylation causes those regions to become open chromatin, allowing the elements in them to effect genomic integrity. In particular transposable elements may replicate or move and insert themselves in gene sequences, possibly disrupting normal transcription or activating oncogenes. When methylation of repetitive elements is lost, genomic integrity may be disrupted when matching long stretches on different chromosomes cause recombination between non-homologous chromosomes.</div><div>Per Knudson's hypothesis, it takes multiple "hits" to the genetic machinery to cause cancer. These hits can be either genetic mutations or epigenetic disruptions of normal expression of tumor suppressors, or of the normal silencing of oncogenes. <br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The IGF2 gene (insulin-lile growth factor) is located on chromosome 11, in the same area implicated in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. It is upstream (5' side) of the H19 sequence that transcribes into a noncoding RNA. Immediately upstream of the H19 promoter is the location of an imprint control region (ICR), that when unmethylated binds a protein CTCF, which blocks the action of downstream ehancers on transcription of IGF2, and instead allows them to upregulate the expression of the H19. This is the case in the wild-type maternal allele.</div><div>The paternal allele, contains the methylated version of the ICR, which turns off expression of H19, and does not bind the CTCF protein, thus enabling the enhancers to upregulate IGF2 transcription. </div><div>As methylation of the ICR reaches 100%, IGF2 expression reaches 100% and H19 declines to 0%, and vice versa. This scenario represents the evolutionary tug-of-war between the male parent, promoting maximal growth of its offspring, versus the mother driving to conserve resources for future litters.<br />If the mother's allele is improperly imprinted , both alleles are methylated and we get over-expression of IGF2, which is growth promoting, and this typically results in Wilms' Tumor, a childhood disease of the kidneys.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It can be used to demethylate DNA by inhibiting catalysis of DNMT1's methylation maintenance during mitosis. It is currently approved for treatment in myelodysplastic syndrome, a cancer of blood cells. The mechanism in this cancer appears to be demethylating the promoter of the gene coding for apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). The modified epigenome also shows histone acetylation of a non-CpG-island, but CpG-rich region located 2kb upstream of the TRAIL transcription start site. Both these epigenetic effects upregulate the expression of the gene, which has a tumor suppressing effect (induces cell death).  <span><br /><br />Although</span> the experiment described in the "Economist" article used a different demethylating agent, it suggests that a combination of DNA-demethylating agent together with Histone deacetylation inhibitor applied to an advanced lung tumor (a solid tumor) slowed the progression of disease, or at least enhanced the effectiveness of standard chemotherapy afterwards.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Once DNA methylation of a cell's genome is altered, it is inherited by the next generation of cells resulting from mitosis. The way this works within the framework of mitosis is like this: In the S subphase of interphase, two hemimethylated double strands of DNA are produced, and DNMT1 (the maintenance methyltransferase) is directed to the replication sites. In G2 phase DNMT1 completes the copying of methylation pattern to the unmethylated strand. <br />Inhibiting DNMT1 in dividng cells would result in dilution of the methylation pattern over the course of a few divisions.<br />Sensitive periods are the times in which an organism is undergoing Epigenetic programming or reprogramming. In particular there are two critically sensitive periods:<br />1. preimplantation of the embryo - when demethylation and subsequent methylation due to cellular differentiation, and X inactivation occur.<br />2. period of germ cell maturation - when gametes are produced and imprinted.<br />These periods are sensitive to environmental Epigenetic effects. During these periods, treatment of the mother when it is carrying an embryo, or either parent during production of the gametes, with an inhibitor of epigenetic enzymes is likely to interfere with normal reproduction and development.</div>
