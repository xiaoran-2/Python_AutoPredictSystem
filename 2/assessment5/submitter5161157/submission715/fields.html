    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">     CpG islands are often found in the promoter regions of genes, and if the island is methylated the gene will be  silenced.  In normal cells, these islands are usually unmethylated, but in cancer cells CpG island methylation occurs frequently.  This methylation can silence tumor suppressor genes, enabling the progression of the cancer.<br />     Methylation of CpG dinucleotides also occurs in repetitive elements and in intergenic regions.  In normal cells these regions are methylated to prevent genomic instability, which is characterized by undesired recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and their consequent transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters that can alter transcription of nearby genes.  In cancer, cells are found to have a genome-wide hypomethylation.  Demethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability that contributes to the progression of the cancer.  Genomic instability is one of the hallmarks of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">     The H19/Igf2 gene cluster is subject to genomic imprinting of the paternal allele.  This imprinting is accomplished by hypermethylation of the imprint control region (ICR).  The methylation prevents CTCF from binding to the ICR, leading to methylation of the promoter region of the H19 gene.  The promoter methylation results in silencing of the H19 gene and the lack of CTCF binding to the ICR allows downstream enhancers access to the Igf2 gene to enhance its transcription.  This methylation does not occur on the maternal allele, so the H19 gene is expressed.  In addition, CTCF binds to the unmethylated ICR of the maternal allele and blocks enhancer access to Igf2, silencing its expression.  The net result is that H19 is expressed only from the maternal allele and Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele.  In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele is also hypermethylated.  Thus, both alleles behave like the paternally imprinted allele, leading to overexpression of Igf2.  Since Igf2 is an oncogene, its overexpression can contribute to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an FDA approved drug that inhibits the action of DNA methyl-tranferases (DNMTs).  Since DNMTs initiate and maintain methylation of DNA, their inhibition by decitabine results in hypomethylation of DNA.  In cancer, the promoters of tumor suppressor genes are often hypermethylated, silencing the genes.  Treatment with decitabine can reduce this methylation and allow transcription of these tumor suppressors, producing an anti-tumor effect.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">     DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the cell's epigenome since the covalent bonding of a methyl group cannot be undone unless actively attacked by a demethylating agent.  In addition, since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, a cell's DNA methylation status is passed down to the cell's progeny.  Hence, any alteration of a cell's DNA methylation will continue to affect not only that cell, but also all of its progeny.  While the methylation status of a given cell lineage usually remains constant, there are times when reprogramming of the methylation status of many genes within a cell takes place.  These times are referred to as sensitive periods and during development there are two main sensitive periods:  Early development of the fertilized egg, and germ cell development.  Since during these periods the methylation status of many genes is being established, treatment with demethylating drugs could result in aberrant gene expression and problems with the developing embryo or, in the case of the germ cells, with future embryos.<br /></div>
