    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Cytosine in CpG islands are unmethylated if genes are expressed. This observation leads to the speculation that methylation of CpG sites in the promoters of genes can inhibit the expression of a gene, as like as function in cancer,  in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. Thus, hypermethylation occurs when tumor suppressor genes, specifically favors the tumor process.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> Normally, the expression of the genes occurs only on the paternal allele (KCNQOT1 and IGF2) or maternal allele (CDKN1C and H19). IGF2 fetal encodes a growth factor that promotes growth in a manner similar to insulin. Increased expression explain the somatic hyper and predisposition to tumor development. CDKN1C encodes a growth suppressor protein and cell proliferation in the family of Cdk inhibitors, so alteration also explains the high predisposition to tumors such as Wilm's tumor - caused by biallelic expression of IGF2 and loss of expression of gene h19. RNA transcription and H19 KCNQOT1 suppresses the expression of the maternal copy of paternal IGF2 and CDKN1C, respectively. In 60% of affected individuals there KCNQOT1 maternal hypomethylation and between 2 and 7% of patients, have hypermethylation of maternal H19 gene, decreasing the expression of CDKN1C and possibly results in higher levels of expression of IGF2.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Decitabine is a cytidine analog that inhibits desoxinucleoside selective DNA methyltransferases in low doses, causing hypomethylation gene promoters, which may cause a reactivation of tumor suppressor genes, inducing cell differentiation or cell senescence, followed by programmed cell death.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an important mechanism that regulates gene expression in cells. An increase in DNA methylation can cause blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell growth and division. When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division ceases to be regulated and allows or promotes cancer. epigenetic new anticancer drugs have a double effect. One approach is by demethylation or by affecting DNA methylation. Through this process of demethylation, the normal tumor suppressor genes function so that control of cell growth is restored is restored. <span>It is clear that there are periods during postnatal development in which the developing has heightened sensitivity to environmental influences. These sensitive periods represent heightened epochs of brain plasticity and celular development where the early environment is able to shape neural circuits and imprinting of alelos or genetic information, and thus determine structural and functional aspects like as risk to development cancer of tumors. </span></div>
