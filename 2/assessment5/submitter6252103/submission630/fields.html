    <h1>Submission 630 from Anon (session_user_id: 7dfeb6e7df5f56403633bec453df1a90e93747c3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Alterations in DNA methylation have enduring effects because methylation (as others epigenetic marks) are mitotically heritable, this means, the offspring from a cell with a specific pattern of methylation will inherit the same pattern of marks that mother cell had at the time of division unless these marks are modify during sensitive periods (periods in cycle cell when occurs the epigenetic reprograming and epigenetic marks are removed). The sensitive periods of development are the epigenetic reprograming in germ cells and early development and also the active remodelling of epigenetic marks during differentiation. Treating patients during these periods could be deleterious for the offspring of the patient because epigenetic drugs act on every tissue but specially in those that are actively dividing or differentiating. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an DNMT1 inhibitor, It prevents the hypermethylation at the cpg islands  (and silence of tumour suppressor genes) observed in tumour cells, causing decrease of methylation and allowing expression of tumour suppressor genes. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>To the H19/Igf2 cluster:</div><div>In a normal cell: In the maternal allele ICR of the H19 is unmethylated and permit the  binding of  the insulator CTCF, CTCF insulate Igf2  silencing Igf2, so enhancers act on H19 expressing It. In the paternal allele the ICR of the H19 is methylated blocking the binding of CTCF, so nothing insulate Igf2 and being that enhancers have preference for Igf2, Igf2 is express and methylation of ICR spreads to H19 causing its silence.</div><div>In Wilm's tumour ICR is methylated in maternal and paternal allele, so enhancers will act on Igf2 of both alleles resulting in expression of the two alleles. </div><div>Many imprinting genes are involved in growth, eigther growth promoting or growth supressing and in the specific case of Igf2, this is a growth promoting, an oncogen. In Wilm's tumour we have overexpression of an oncogen due to loss of imprinting. </div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In the normal cell cpg islands are hypomethylated , (because these  regions are more transcriptional active ( expressed) while the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are highly methylated to maintain genome stability. </div><div>In contrast, in a cancer cell cpg islands tends to be more methylated and this causes silence of tumor supressor genes in a previously normal cell, and due to  DNA methylation is mitotically heritable this silence allows the cells resist to die, divide faster and spreading the epimutation rapidly. On the other hand intergenic regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated both of these causes genome instability for example by activating surrounding genes.</div></div>
