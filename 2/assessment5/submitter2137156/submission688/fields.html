    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation,
therefore, they are hypomethylated. Usually,they are in promoters so they are
vital for regulation of gene expression due to altered binding of transcription
factor with respect to the methylation. Some CpG islands are dynamically
methylated between cell types and via their proper methylation they enable
inactivation of X chromosome as well as ensure mitotic heritability due to symmetrical
methylation of nascent (new) DNA strand. Also, proper methylation is
indispensable in forming regular chromatin conformation via its interaction with
chromatin remodelers.</p>

<p>In cancer, some CpG islands become hypermethylated and if these islands
happen to be in promoters of tumor suppressor genes, that can lead to silencing
of tumor suppressor gene. Due to the fact that this change usually involves
enhanced proliferative potential, cells with above described epimutation divide
faster and quantitatively overcame normal cells. Also, specific tumours have
specific methylation profiles (specific CpG islands methylated) and CpG island
hypermethylation progresses with time.</p>

<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated
what usually leads to more condensed chromatin structure and is actually
silencing repeats by prevention of their transposition. Moreover, methylated cytosine
is easily mutated what affects function of genes for transposition of repeats. That
ensures genomic stability because it prevents deletions, insertions and
translocations. Also, this hypermethylation silences cryptic transcription
start sites or cryptic splice sites what prevents irregular gene expression and
transcriptional interference from strong promoters. </p>

<p><span> In cancer, intergenic regions and
repetitive elements become hypomethylated what results in genomic instability
because it can allow illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of
repeats and their transposition, disruption of coding regions of genes,
activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes. Also,
hypomethylation of intergenic regions can lead to deletions, insertions and reciprocal
translocations.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted control region is methylated on paternal allele what prevents
binding of CTCF insulator and enables binding of enhancers on promoter region
of Igf2 which leads to expression of Igf2. Imprinted control region is unmethylated
on maternal allele so CTCF insulator can bind and prevent communication of Igf2
promoter and enhancers what silences gene Igf2 on maternal allele.</p>

<p><span>In Wilms tumour, ICR on maternal allele becomes hypermethylated and that
results in overexpression of Igf2.  Due
to the fact that Igf2 is oncogene which promotes growth, its increased amount
can lead to uncontrolled cell division what is one of the hallmarks of tumorigenesis.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine
belongs to DNA-demethylating agents because, as cytidine analog, it
incorporates in DNA and it inhibits DNA-methyltransferase what makes the whole
genome, in non-specific  manner,
susceptible to hypomethylation. In other words, promoters of tumor-supressor
genes, in decitabine treatment, become hypomethylated what results in proper
expression of these anti-tumour proteins and prevents tumorigenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because
epigenetic changes are passed on daughter and granddaughter cells during cell
division so tumor cells don’t have to be eradicted if they endure permanent treatment/recovery.
A sensitive period is defined by increased sensitivity to the regulatory
effects of epigenetic mechanisms and in human development there are two
sensitive periods: pre-implantation period in early development and during germ
cell development. Treatment with epigenetic drugs in sensitive periods can lead
to altered, abnormal methylation patterns in tumor cells but also in primordial
germ cells and germ cells in young patients because they are non-specifically
affected by drug and this change involves the whole organism potentially
developing from affected germ cell so this can have long lasting consequences –
in terms of tumorigenesis or some other disorder. </p>
