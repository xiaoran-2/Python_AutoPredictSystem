    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, proper DNA methylation is critical to genome stability. It is used in gene silencing and in gene activation depending on cell type and context and assists in chromosome silencing in the case of X inactivation. Methylation marks are laid down by DNA methyltranferases (DNMT3a/3b) and maintained through mitosis by DNMT1. CpG islands (promotors at actives genes) are normally unmethylated (hypomethylated), while CpGs in intergenic regions, which comprise most of the genome, and at repeats (transposons), are heavily methylated (hypermethylated). In much of the genome, DNA methylation along with histone methylation results in the formation of tightly compacted heterochromatin, providing structure to the genome. Cell growth, mitosis rates and cell lifetimes are properly regulated. Tumor suppressors are active.<br /><br />In cancer, this gets turned on its head:  We see hypermethylation occurring at CpG islands (exacerbated by aging, where this gradually happens over time) and CpG island shores. Genes which should be active (e.g., those involved in regulation of cell growth and tumor suppression) are silenced; those which should be inactive, such as oncogenes, get activated and are able grow without restraint. We also see hypomethylation genome wide, leading to repeats being activated and running amuck, interfering with normal cell function, illegitimate recombination, a loss of heterochromatin structure and overall chromatin instability. When this happens at imprint control regions (ICRs), we also see loss of imprinting with bad patient outcomes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In healthy cells, imprint control regions (ICRs) bring about imprinted gene expressions by various mechanisms. In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster on human chromosome 11, imprinted gene expression is brought about by enhancer blocking on maternal allele and DNA methylation on the paternal allele. On the maternal allele an insulator protein, CTCF, binds to the ICR, preventing enhancers from activating Igf2 upstream of the ICR, but allowing the expression of H19, a long non-coding RNA.  However, DNA methylation of the ICR on the paternal allele, prevents the binding of the CTCF protein and silences H19. The enhancers are able to loop back and activate Igf2, a growth promoter.<br /><div><br />In cancer, when hypermethylation of the ICR occurs, both the maternal and paternal alleles are affected: The ICR of the maternal allele is also methylated, preventing CTCF from binding, causing the it to behave in the same manner as the paternal allele described above. As a result, H19 is silenced and Igf2 is activated on both alleles. Monoallelic imprinting is lost, resulting in a double dose of igf2, a growth promoter. This results in Wilm's tumor (a kidney cancer in children).</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of DNA methylation in cancer growth is very much context dependent. In cancers driven by uncontrolled growth (hypermethylation of tumor suppressors), then a reduction in DNA methylation would help stimulate activation of silenced tumor suppressors, which in turn may help to arrest cancer cell replication and suppress tumor growth. In cancers driven by chromatin instability (as a result of genome wide hypomethylation), then an increase in DNA methylation would be helpful. The <em>Economist</em> article discusses the former and how overmethylation can be detrimental. The drug Decitabine belongs to class of DNMT inhibitors (DNA demethyating agents), which reduce the effect of the DNA methyltransferases, reducing DNA methylation at the CpG promoters of tumor suppressor genes, allowing them to be activated and inhibit cancer cell and tumor growth. This allows standard chemotherapy, perhaps in smaller doses, to be more effective.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG sites are the most abundant across mammalian genomes. In general, DNA methylation is laid down on these sites during development by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT3a/3b). As cells replicate, the daughter alleles are unmethylated. DNMT1 has an affinity for these hemi-methylated strands and methylates the daughter alleles. Thus, DNA methylation is a stable, mitotically heritable epigenetic mark.  if a combination of epigenetic drugs, which inhibit over methylation, along with standard chemotherapy are effective at arresting/reversing cancer growth, then these results may be heritable across subsequent cell generations via this mechanism.<br /><br />The exception to the process described above is during "sensitive periods" ( during early embryonic and primordial germ cell development), where both paternal and maternal alleles are demethylated and these epigenetic marks are cleared/reset. Treating patients during these sensitive periods is inadvisable because of the unknown affects this may have on imprinting or the clearing or resetting of these epigenetic marks. In the worst scenario, these drugs may promote rather than retard cancer growth (e.g., loss of imprinting) and may then affect subsequent cell generations. Because one of the "sensitive periods" is during PGC development, who knows what effect this might have on meiotic heritability or viability of offspring.<br /></div>
