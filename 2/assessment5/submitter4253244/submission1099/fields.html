    <div class="field-value">CpG island are DNA regions, found in  60% of the promotors, containing a high proportion of CG nucleotides. Methylation of CpG island leads to silencing of the gene. <br />In normal conditions, CpG islands remain mainly unmethylated. Methylation at CpG island happen in the maternal or paternal allele of imprinted genes, leading to the silencing of this allele. <br />However, in cancer, there is a characteristic hypermethylation at CpG Islands. <br />Hypermethylation at CpG island contributes to cancer. Indeed, hypermethylations are found at the CpG island  in the promotor of tumor suppressor genes. This is leading to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes.<br />Hypermethylation of CpG island leads alsol to a loss of imprinting. The maternal and the paternal allele of the gene are both methylated and this can cause cancer like for instance in Wilm's tumor.<br /><br />In normal conditions, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. Methylation of repeats is necessary to protect genomic integrity.  Their silencing prevents transposition and illegitimate recombination. Intergenic regions are also methylated, silencing cryptic transcription start or splice. There is as well methylation in the non-CpG island promotors.<br />In cancer, there is a general hypomethylation of the genome. The promotors of oncogenes are found hypomethylated, leading to their activation. Hypomethylation of intergenic region and repetitive elements leading to genomic instability. Indeed, hypomethylation of intergenic elements will lead to activation of cryptic promotors and perturbation of the neighboring genes.  Hypomethylation of repeats leads to illegitimate recombination  and transposition of these repetitive elements. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of imprinting can contribute to cancer. One classical example is the loss of imprinting at the H19/ Igf2 cluster that lead to Wilm's tumor.<br />In normal condition, the paternal allele is methylated. <br />In absence of methylation (maternal allele), CTCF can bind DNA insulator region between Igf2 and its  downstream enhancers. The enhancers will then activate H19 and Igf2 will be silenced.<br />In the paternal allele, methylation occurs at the insulator region, preventing binding of CTCF. Without CTCF, the enhancers are able to activate Igf2 expression. And there is propagation of the methylation until H19 promotor leading to its silencing. <br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, there is a loss of imprinting. Both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated. Both alleles are then expressing Igf2. This is leading to Igf2 overexpression and loss of H19 expression. Igf2 is a growth factor, so its overexpression leads to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs targeting epigenetic processes are now started to be use to treat cancer. For instance, Decitabine is already used to treat myelodisplasic syndrom. Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is inhibiting DNMT1 enzyme, avoiding to the inheritance of methylation by unmethylated strand. Administration of decitabine to patients leads to a general decrease of DNA methylation, especially at CpG islands that are hypermethylated in cancer.<br />Hypermethylation at CpG island in cancer was shown to silence tumor suppressor genes. In the presence of decitabine, tumor suppressors genes are no longer silenced and thus, decitabine prevent/slow down cancer proliferation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Indeed, DNMT1 is able to recognize hemi-methylated DNA and then restore the methylation on both strands of the DNA.<br />Altering DNA methylation during cancer treatment will have effects that last even after the treatment because the unadequate DNA methylation will continue to be inherited thanks to DNMT1.<br />A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are removed and reprogrammed, ie early development of the embryo and development of the gametes. For a patient, it will be during the pregnancy and the childhood.<br />Treating patients with epigenetic machineries targeting drugs wouldn't be advisable because the alteration due to the drugs will not be only heritable during the lifespan of the patient but will be as well transmitted to future generations.<br /><br /></div>
