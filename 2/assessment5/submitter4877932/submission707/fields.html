    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at the 5 position of cytosine is corelated with gene expression. DNA methylation typically occurs in CpG dinucleotide context and non-CpG methylation is found in some extend in embryonic stem cells. Unmethylated CpGs are often grouped in clusters called CpG islands and present in many genes.<br />However in cancer cells CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated which causing gene silencing. This kind of epigenetic mutation is dangerous when especially genes that regulate the cell cycle are silenced. In this case cells may grow uncontrollably and lead tumorigenesis.<br />Importantly DNA methylation in different genomic regions may exert different influences on gene activities. One of the main roles of DNA methylation within intergenic regions is to repress the expression of harmful genetic elements such as retro virus.  <br />Repetitive elements present a large portion of human genome and contain much of the methylation in human tissue. Repeat sequences are such as DNA satellites, that are found commonly in pericentromeric or subtelomeric heterochromatin and help to maintenance closed chromatin structure and genomic integrity. DNA methylation represents a defense mechanism against selfish DNA elements, preserves the structural integrity of the genome by “masking” repetitive sequences, and contributes to transcriptional repression and gene silencing. <br />The CpG poor regions found in repetitive elements within the intergenic regions of the genome are methylated and thereby maintain a closed chromatin structure. In cancer and on the inactive X chromosome many CpG islands become methylated forcing these regions into a closed chromatin structure. When CpG islands located within promoters are methylated, the corresponding genes are persistently silenced. In contrast, the CpG poor regions become hypomethylated allowing for an open chromatin structure. As a consequence of hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, transposable elements may become active and contribute to the genomic instability observed in cancer cells.<div><div><br /></div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypometylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltranferase. When there is an increase in DNA methylation, this can result in the blockage of the activity of suppressor genes. When the suppressor genes are blocked,cell division becomes unregulated and it can promote cancer. Decitabine is interfering with DNA methylation as a demethylating agent and by this way restoring the function of the tumor suppressor genes. R<span>eactivation of tumor suppressor genes in tumor cells leads inhibition of tumor growth. </span><br /><span><br /><br /><br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>

    <div class="field-value">The IGF2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called insulin-like growth factor 2. This protein plays an essential role in growth and development before birth. T<span>he </span>IGF2 gene is inherited from paternal allele is methylated and maternal allele is not methylated. IGF2<span> is part of a cluster of genes that undergo genomic imprinting. Another gene in this cluster, </span>H19 <span>is also involved in growth and development. A nearby region of DNA known as imprinting center 1 (ICR 1) or the H19 differentially methylated region controls the parent-specific genomic imprinting of both the </span>H19<span> and </span>IGF2 genes. Methylation is excluded from the maternal allele by CTCF binding. The presence of CTCF complex an<div>insulator function upon the ICR, which blocks access of the IGF2 promoters to the enhancers downstream of the H19 gene . This function is lost on the methylated paternal chromosome and this enables IGF2 expression by allowing the promoters to access the enhancers.<br /><br /></div>In some people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, the ICR1 region is hypermethylated.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drug resistance is one of the major problem in treating the cancer. It is an important limitation for the efficiency of chemotheraphy. Drug sensitivity is influenced by alterations in genes such as DNA repair, drug uptake apoptosis and cell cycle checkpoint. Recently it has been found that epigenetic alteration has as well an important role in drug resistance. Due to increase the success of chemotheraphy, we may use the epigenetic drug. Unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic alterations are reversible. More importantly epigenetic changes are  passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells untill they actively erased. Unlike the other form of gene regulation epigenetic changes are stable and heritable changes. This can help to maintain the alteration in DNA methylation due to epigenetic drugs during the chemotheraphy.<br />However epigenetic drugs may interfering with the normal epigenetic programming especially during critical steps of development. In this respect treatment with an epigenetic drug would be inadvisable in pregnant women and in early childhood due to a lot of epigenetic reprogramming.<br /></div>
