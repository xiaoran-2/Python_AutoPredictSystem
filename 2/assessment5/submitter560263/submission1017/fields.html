    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands
are not normally methylated, but when they are this leads to silencing of gene
expression.</p>

<p>The DNA
methylation in cancer are seen as locus specific DNA hypermethylation at CpG
islands and a genome-wide DNA hypomethylation at repetitive elements and CpG
poor promoters. Both are seen at ICRs with loss of imprinting as a result.</p>

<p><span>So when comparing
a normal cell to a cancer cell we see a shift in methylation.  In normal cells the CpG islands are hypomethylated,
whereas the intergenic regions,repetitive elements and also the introns are
methylated. In contrast the cancer cells are likely to be methylated at the CpG
islands and hypomethylated at the intergenic regions, repetitive elements and
introns.</span></p>

<p>When the
CpG islands are hypermethylated in promoters of tumor suppressor genes this
lead to gene silencing and the cancer cell can grow freely.</p>

<p><span>The
function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic
integrity and also to silence cryptic transcription start sites as well as
cryptic slice sites. In the repetitive elements the DNA methylation also
functions to maintain genomic integrity. Silencing of repeats are needed to
prevent transposition, as are mutations of the repeat (meC to T) and to avoid
transcriptional interfering from strong promoters. The methylation of repeats
may also prevent illegitimate recombination. The concequences of
hypomethylation is activations of all these, leading to genomic instability and
oncogene expression (cancer growth).</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting
control regions (ICRs) are subjected to DNA methylation alterations, either
hypo- or hyper-methylation, that can lead to loss of imprinting. This loss
leads to the loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression
of growth promoting genes.</p>

<p>The H19/Igf2
cluster is paternally imprinted and acts by enhancer blocking. The paternal
allele is methylated at the ICR and without binding of the CTCF (the insulator
protein) the methylation spreads to the H19 promoter and silence the gene. The
enhancers are free to access and activate the Igf2. The maternal allele is not
methylated at the ICR and CTCF can bind. This prevents the downstream enhancers
to get to Igf2 and instead they access and activate the H19 gene. </p>

<p><span>In Wilm’s
tumor we see a hypermethylation of ICR resulting in the maternal allele
expressing the Igf2 so there is a double expression of the gene, and no
expression of the H19 gene. As Igf2 is a growth promoting gene we get
uncontrolled cell growth leading to cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine
belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents, also known as DNA-methyltransferase
inhibitors (DNMTi). The DNMTi is a nucleoside analogue that binds to the DNA
strand and is incorporated into the DNA by replication. It then binds the
methyltransferase irrevesebly when that come along to copy the methylation to daughter
cells and cannot be released again. And since cancer cells divide more they are
also more prone to this hypomethylation. When given at a low dosage the
Decitabine has a good anti-neoplastic effect, killing the tumor cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />Sensitive periods are when active remodelling of the epigenome occur. It takes place during Primodial germ cell development and the early embryonic development, as a removal and laying down of epigenetic makers. It is at this time that altered environments can have an effect on the genetic control.<br />Treating young patients during sensitive periods would make the alterations take place in they germ cells.</div>
