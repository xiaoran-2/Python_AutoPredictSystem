    <div class="field-value">There is no one simple way in which DNA methylation is altered in cancer.  DNA methylation plays a variety of roles in maintaining genomic order, and so many different alterations to DNA methylation can contribute to cancer pathogenesis.  In normal functioning, DNA methylation exists in regions of the genome known as CpG islands, where the pairing of a cytosine next to a guanine.  These regions are often found in the promoter region of various genes and hence they help to determine the gene's expression level.  Methylation of a CpG dinucleotide leads to transcriptional silencing via the recruitment of methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) bearing proteins and the subsequent formation of heterochromatin.  Therefore, cancer can be caused/exacerbated by either hypomethylation or hypermethylation if the gene in question is either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, respectively.  If an oncogene is hypomethylated, cellular activity and mitosis can increase, leading to runaway growth and eventually metastasis.  Alternatively, hypermethylation of a tumor suppressor removes the fail-safes that normally prevent such occurrences.  <br /><br />Two elements of the genome which can contribute to cancer following epigenetic errors are the regions between genes (intergenic regions) and long sequences of recurring repeats (repetitive elements).  Under normal conditions, intergenic regions are stretches of noncoding DNA, which both contribute to genomic stability.  Silencing of repetitive elements additionally prevents mutagenic transposition, transcriptional interference and illegitimate recombination.  Global hypomethylation is seen in cancer in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which contributes to genomic instability and increased activity of transposable elements.  This can result in insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocations, which disrupt proper cell functioning.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In Wilm's tumor, a disruption of genomic imprinting has been shown to contribute to tumorigenesis.  Under normal conditions of genomic imprinting, methylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster is relatively high in the maternal allele and relatively low in the paternal allele.  On the maternal allele, under normal conditions, the Igf2 imprint control region is unmethylated, thereby allowing CTCF to bind the insulator element, which leads to downstream enhancers acting on H19 rather than Igf2.  Hence, on the maternal allele, Igf2 is silenced.  On the paternal allele, under normal conditions, the imprint control region is highly methylated, which prevents CTCF binding, thereby leading the enhancers to be directed to Igf2, up-regulating its expression.  In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele is hypermethylated, which leads to expression of Igf2, effectively granting a double dose of that growth factor, thereby contributing to cancerous growth.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, which is an analog of cytidine, is a hypomethylating agent, and is used to prevent acute myelogenous leukaemia by treating myelodysplastic syndromes, their precursors.  When decitabine is incorporated into a DNA strand, it acts to inhibit DNA methyltransferase and thereby demethylate the DNA.  <span>In combination with a histone deacteylase inhibitor, decitabine slowed tumor growth in some people with advanced lung cancer.  It is therefore likely that decitabine acts to demethylate tumor suppressor genes, allowing them to contribute to the body's intended anti-cancer functions.<br /></span><span><br /><br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetics is generally defined as a stable condition of the proteins, marks and other signal associated with regulating how and whether DNA is transcribed.  Therefore, it is not hard to imagine that epigenetic drugs can produce lasting alterations that endure past the period of treatment.  Once set, either in development or by the environment, epigenetic marks are maintained to some degree, and hence the persistence of these drugs' effects.  However, because there are only very specific time periods where epigenetic change is 'expected', clinicians must exercise caution when prescribing such drugs.  We already know of the importance of sensitive periods in development, which are time-spans where epigenetic changes occur naturally, such as in embryonic development and in primordial germ cells.  During these sensitive periods, epigenetic marks may be reset or laid down de novo (for instance, in imprinted genes during both embryo development and meiosis in primordial germ cells), which makes them especially vulnerable to drugs which affect epigenetic regulation.  Unintended side effects of the use of such drugs during a sensitive period would result in epigenetic changes being more widely spread across the genome which could persist for life and even into the next generation.</div>
