    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Usually in the maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster, there is no methylation of the imprint control region, therefore CTCF can bind the imprint control region. This allows the downstream enhancers to act upon the h19 whereas CTCF blocks the promotion
of Igf2, meaning Igf2 will be silent. Normally the cluster is paternally imprinted, so the imprint control region is methylated, CTCF can't bind and the enhancers act on Igf2 which means Igf2 i expressed. In Wilm's tumour, there is hypermethylation, so
both imprint control regions are methylated, which means there is a double dose of Igf2 being expressed. Igf2 is growth promoting, and therefore can over cell growth which contributes to a tumour in cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG  islands usually functions to silence genes and is also found in x inactivation. However in cancer CpG islands can be hypermethylated which causes silencing of more genes than necessary. The promotors of tumour suppressor genes are often found in CpG Islands, so if these promotors are silenced, tumour suppressor genes can't be expressed, and consequently cancer cells can grow and multiply (and this serves as one of the 'hits' to DNA that contributes to cancers). 

Normally repetitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated to ensure that genetic stability is maintained. Repeats are methylated and in a heterochromatin format to ensure they don't bind repeats with high homogeneity and recombine, but in cancer they become hypomethylated, which allows for chromosomes to be transposed, they can recombine to form potentially carcinogenic combinations and have bases inserted and deleted. Cryptic promotors can also be activated. Overall this causes the genome to become unstable and the genome therefore has a higher propensity to become cancerous. This combined enhances tumorigenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor that reduces the amount of DNA methylation in cancers. One of the contributions to cancer is that CpG Islands, and other locus specific areas are hypermethylated. If the tumour is dependent on tumour suppressor promotors being hypermethylated in CpG islands, then by reducing that global DNA methylation, the tumour suppressor genes will once again become active, and have an anti-tumour effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation marks are mitotically heritable to offspring, and can be maintained by both active and passive methylation. Acquired DNA methylation by periods of famine in women who are in a sensitive period can be passed down to their daughters, and even their granddaughters. A sensitive period is a period in development when environmental effects can have a lasting effect on both epigenetic control and epigenetic marks for various genes. Those periods are as follows: embryogenesis, gametogenesis, and ages 9-12 in boys and 8-10 in girls. If a person's epigenetics are altered due to famine, for example, whilst they are in a sensitive period, the foetus, and even the primordial germ cells can be effected, for example, they can adjust to a lower caloric intake, which then can cause obesity in later life.  Treating patients during these sensitive periods could cause DNA methylation to be added or modified when epigenetic marks are being established for the next two generations and that could cause the effects of the methylation to be transgenerationally inherited.</div>
