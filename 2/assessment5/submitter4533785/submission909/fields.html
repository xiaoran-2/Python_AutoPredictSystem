    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually found at gene promoters and are
normally rarely methylated, independent of whether they are active or not. In
many cancers the CpG islands (and so called “CpG island shores” at their edges)
are hypermethylated which leads to silencing of the genes controlled by the
promoter. These genes are very often tumour suppressor genes which, such as ER
in retinoblastoma or BRCA1 in breast cancer, which are involved in cell cycle,
apoptosis or DNA repair. Epigenetic silencing of tumour suppressors is actually
more common in cancer than their mutation. Hypermethylation at different CpG
islands can be specific to a given tumour type and often increases with time as
tumour grows.</p>

<p>Intragenic regions and repetitive sequences in the genome
are methylated in healthy cells, which prevents the expression and activation
of retroviral transposons and ensures genomic stability. Genome-wide
hypomethylation and especially the intergenic regions and repeats is common in
cancer, which leads to genomic instability (e.g. recombination between repeats
which are no longer in heterochromatin), activation of cryptic promoters and sometimes
disruption of neighbouring genes. Genomic instability is the primary cause of
many cancers, as it can lead to duplication or disruption of genes (e.g.
oncogenes) and with time to accumulation of genetic changes.</p>

<p>Role of DNA methylation is context dependent – some cancers
are more driven by hypermethylation of tumour suppressors and their promoters,
other by hypomethylation and resulting genomic instability. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting means expression from either the maternal or the paternal allele. This is
achieved by methylation of imprint control region (ICR) on one of the
alleles. In case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR at the paternal
allele is methylated, which blocks
binding of CTCF protein to the ICR. CTCF is an “insulator” protein which
protects Igf2 from enhancers downstream, acting probably by chromatin looping. When CTCF is not bound, the methylation
spreads to the neighbouring H19 promoter and the enhancers drive
expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele. In contrast, the ICR at the
maternal allele is not methylated and it can be bound by CTCF protein. This
insulates Igf2 from the action of enhancers (which loop with the non-methylated
promoter of the H19 non-coding RNA instead driving its expression) and as a
result Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele.</p>

<p>Igf2 promotes cell growth, so it’s an oncogene. It is
upregulated in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome where the maternal allele behaves
like the paternal one and the ICR is methylated.
As a result, Igf2 is expressed from both alleles, which leads to uncontrolled
cell growth and predisposition to embryonic and childhood tumours,
e.g. Wilm’s tumour in the kidney.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, inhibiting
DNA methyl transferase. It is a cytidine analogue (Wikipedia) which is incorporated into DNA during
replication and irreversibly binds DNMT blocking its action and leads to  reducing the overall levels of methylation. </p><p>

</p><p>It is approved for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, which
is a precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia. While it is toxic and
non-specific at high concentrations, affecting all dividing cells, at low doses
it has good effect on blood-derived cancers such as AMS, as they are often
driven mainly by hypermethylation of tumour suppressors. It is being tested for
therapy of solid tumours in combination with other drugs targeting epigenetic processes
(histone deacetylase inhibitors).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and can be passed
stably during the cell division, either in the body or during clonal tumour
growth. As altered DNA methylation is often associated with the tumour
progression, metastasis and overall patient prognosis, “priming” the tumour by
methylation or demethylation therapy can have an effect on the tumour growth,
which might make it more responsive to standard chemotherapy. </p>

<p>Altering DNA methylation at one time point can thus have a
lifelong effect on the epigenome of an organism, especially if it is given
during a sensitive period when new epigenetic marks are usually laid down. Two
main sensitive periods in development are: precursor germ cell development when
the paternal and maternal imprinted genes are set in eggs and sperm and
pre-implantation embryonic development when paternal and maternal genomes are
re-set. There is also some sensitivity during later growth when tissue-specific
epigenetic marks are set. Treating patients during these sensitive periods
(e.g. in childhood when germ cells still develop or in early pregnancy) with
agents altering DNA methylation balance could result in disruption of
imprinting, improper re-setting of methylation levels or demethylation of genomic
repeats which remain methylated during both sensitive periods.</p></div>
