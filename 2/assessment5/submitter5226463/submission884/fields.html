    <div class="field-value"><span>Some genes controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair are known as cancer suppressor genes. Their promotor regions - containing such CpG islands - should have their DNA hypomethylated, so that they remain active or in open frame.  If they are hypermethylated they become silenced and therefore the suppressor genes no longer operate. By contrast, in the intergenic regions and in repetitive regions, the normal chromatin his more heavily methylated than these same regions in chomatids which suffered oncogenic transformation. It's a general feature of the cancer cell that it's DNA is overall less methylated than the normal counterpart. Since methylation is one of the ways a cell keeps certain specific traits from one cell (somatic) generation to the other, it is not surprizing that cancer arises or progresses when these regulatory features are no longer in their proper places. DNA methylation is also critical in fixing another epigenomic signals, like chromatin structural designs and chomosome display inside the nucleus. It's involved with genes important for the epigenome. The repetitive regions may provoke illegitimate and catastrophic recombinations either within the same chromosome or between neighbouring chromosomes. The removal of DNA methylation protection make these abnormal events much easier to occur and indeed one can find lots of aberrant chomosomal structure in all types of cancer cells.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The <i>H19</i> appears to function as a RNA oncogene as it is activated in many types of cancer. In the normal embryonic development the paternal allele is silenced. In the normal individual this allows the expression of the <i>IGF2 </i>paternal allele. In a number of cancer pathologies one observes that the<em> H19</em> paternal allele has undergone activation. This is correlated with the loss of methylation at the <i>IGF2</i> regulatory site in the maternal allele.  In the Wilms tumour the expression of both <i>IGF2</i> alleles occurs. According to studies in mice without methylases genes, the non-methylation of <em>H19</em> promoter also silences <em>IGF2</em>. It's product - the Insulin-like growth-factor - is produced in double dosis in the oncogenic cell. This enables oncogenic cells to grow faster than other neighbours. It functions as a selective agent for the cancer cell. Many cancers show enhanced expression of H19 possibly because it is correlated with high <em>IGF2</em> expression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabin is a methyltransferase inhibitor. It's an analog to cytidine. Probably, it is incorporated during DNA replication in place of cytidine and it is not recognized as a substrate by the enzyme methyltransferase and the CpG sites remain unmethylated or hypomethylated. In the Economist article this drug is cited - among others-  for myelodysplastic syndromes treatment. Such syndromes are precursors
of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Perhaps by removing the CpG methylation in some clusters inside promoter regions, this drug allows tumor suppressors to be expressed in great number. If this happens in pre-oncogenic cells, it won't allow these cells to go a step beyond. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is largelly maintained in the adult. It seems to progress slowly with aging but essentially it is a mechanism that enables the cells to remain committed to their functions, to remain differentiated as it should. It is necessary to reproduce in each cell type the same pattern of methylation along multiple cell cycles. The disruption of this may trigger a cascade of epigenomic unforeseen and undesirable events. I know that the first period of embryogenesis is a sensitive period aswell as the latter stages in faetal development when many germ-cell precursors are built. But I don't believe that pregnant women would even be subjected to such treatments in any case. I think a most delicate situation is when adults really need to be treated with methylation altering drugs. They must think of their gonads if they wish to keep their reprodutive capacity. If they need such treatment and want to have children, it's necessary to collect their gametes so that they still have the option of having children without epigenomic risk. It could be a very subtle thing not easy to detect with very nasty effects in their life or even in the children's children lifetime. </div>
