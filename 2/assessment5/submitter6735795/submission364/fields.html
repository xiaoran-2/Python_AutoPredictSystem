    <div class="field-value"><p>English is not my first language. I used Google-Translator.</p><p><span>Cancer involves changes in DNA methylation levels. CpG islands are found in
about 60% of promoters regions [1]. In this regions the high density
of CpG are hypomethylated and therefore the genes are transcribed. In cancer cells,
promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes
silencing of the genes. They are not all methylated, but they are more
methylated than in a normal cell, the level of methylation is higher.</span></p><p>Because CpG islands are methylated, if they are in the promoter regions of
the tumor suppressor genes (TSG), this gene is inactivated. If CpG islands in
both alleles of a TSG are methylated the cell can, with another number of
factors, became a cancer cell.</p><p>In a normal cell, the intergenic regions and
repetitive elements are heavily methylated and they belong to heterochromatin. Therefore,
illegitimate recombination between repeats is not possible because the DNA is
too densely packaged for recombination to occur. Cancer cells have s hypomethylation
of these repetitive elements or the intergenic regions. Illegitimate
recombination can occur because they are not densely packaged down into
heterochromatin. The repeats have the capacity to make copies and jump around
the genome or transpose. This genetic instability and reciprocal translocations
between chromosomes can result in subsequent problems. When transposable
elements jump they may disrupt the coding region of a gene (TSG) but it also
may activate neighboring genes (oncogenes) causing cancer.</p><p> </p><p>Electronic References

answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The hypermethylation of imprint control regions (ICR) in cancer cells
causes the loss of imprinting for some important genes like the H19. The H19
gene is expressed exclusively on one parental allele. In normal cells H19 gene is
only transcribed from the maternally inherited allele; the paternal H19 allele
is not expressed [1]. The methylation of the promoter region in
paternal allele cause is silencing.</span></p><p>The protein CTCF is involved in controlling the expression of the gene, by
binding to the H19 ICR in the mother allele. This CTCF biding limits downstream
enhancers to access to the Igf2 region. The H19 gene is transcribed in mother’s
allele and a normal H19 protein is made. If the mother allele loss is
imprinting, caused by the hypermethylation of is ICR, the Igf2 is also expressed.
In this case, both alleles produce the Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell.</p><p><span>The major role of IGF-2 is as a growth-promoting hormone during gestation [2].
In Wilm’s tumor, a childhood kidney cancer, both parental alleles of Igf2 are active

overexpression [3].</span></p><p>Electronic References cited</p><p>[1] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H19_(gene)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H19_(gene)</a></p><p>[2] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_2">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_2</a></p><p>

    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,

cancer due to increase in histone methylation which silence the expression of TGS’s.
An EZH2-targeting drug inhibits the progression of cancer in clinical trials [1]</span></p><p><span>Decitabine is a new class of drugs known as DNA-demethylating agents. When TSG’s
are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. Decitabine's
anticancer effects are believed to be twofold. One way that it works is by
demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA. By this process of
demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus
restoring the control over cell growth [2], [3].</span></p><p><span>Decitabine is used to treat cancers like Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The drugs that alter DNA methylation, like azacitidine and decitabine, have
effects beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic marks are
mitotically heritability and help to maintain the cell’s identity [1].</span></p>

<p>During cell reprogramming, epigenetics marks are erased. In these periods, call
the sensitive periods, germ cell development and early embryonic development, the
DNA epigenome is erased.</p>

<p>During the sensitive periods is an inadvisable uses anti-cancers drug
because DNA demethylation can affect some important heritability epigenetic
marks. For example, during pregnancy, is inadequate the use of these drugs
because is a sensitive period of embryonic development. Latter in
the germ cell development in the fetus can be disrupted.</p>

<p>If oncologists use anti-cancer drugs during these periods, the future newborn
can have more probability to some problems due to epigenetic reprogramming
problems during the sensitive stages. The use of contraception drugs may result
in these cases.</p>
