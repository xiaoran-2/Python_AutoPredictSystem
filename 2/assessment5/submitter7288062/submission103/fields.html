    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation happens on CpG by addition of a 5' methyl group to the cytosine. In mammals, it's is almost only found on C followed by G to respect symmetry on both strands of DNA : CpG dinucleotides. <br />DNA methylation is an inactive epigenetic mark (it silences gene expression). It is set up by DNMT3a and b and is maintained by DNMT1 and is mitotically heritable.<br /><span>Changes in DNA methylation are seen in different types of cancer, especially on CpG islands (CGI) and in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br /><br /><b>CpG islands</b><br /></span><ul><li>CGI are regions of DNA with a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides. CGI are usually not methylated : they are not silenced. CGI are generally found in the promoter of tumor suppressor gene : when they are not methylated, the tumor suppressor gene operates.<br /></li><li>Methylation is a reversible epigenetic mark  : epimutations can occur rapidly and are quite frequent. Moreover, DNA methylation increases with age, so CGI methylation progresses with time.</li><li><b></b>Hypermethylation of these CGI leads to silencing or inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene. Both copies of inactive tumor suppressor gene is one hit of the Knudson hypothesis, and occurs frequently in tumors (and so contribute to cancer).</li></ul><b>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements</b><br /><ul><li>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated : they are silenced.</li><li>Methylation of intergenic regions and repeats can be removed by deletion of DNMT1 or mutations in DNMT3a and b.</li><li>Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions leads to genomic instability (the chromatin is not packaged down enough) and contributes to cancer by illegitimate recombination, activation of repeats or cryptic promoters that produce abnormal karyotypes.</li></ul><b></b><ol><li><b></b></li></ol></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting is the expression of only one allele depending on the parent-of-origin allele. The expression of the allele is controlled by the imprint control region (ICR), which is differentially methylated.<br />Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, as we can see with the example of H19/Igf2 cluster on chromosome 11. This cluster is composed of a coding region called Igf2, an ICR, a region called H19, and enhancers (localized downstream).<br /><ul><li>Paternal allele : the ICR and H19 are methylated, they are silenced. The enhancers act directly on Igf2, which is activated.</li><li>Maternal allele : ICR and H19 are not methylated. The ICR is bound by an insulator protein called CTCF : CTCF insulates Igf2 and the enhancers only act on H19, which produces a long non coding RNA.</li></ul>Therefore, Igf2 is only expressed from the paternal allele, and H19 only from the maternal allele.<br /><ul><li>Disruption in Wilm's tumour : imprinting is lost : the ICR is methylated on both alleles, Igf2 is expressed from both alleles : it is over expressed ; and H19 is not expressed anymore. </li><li>Cancer : Igf2 is a growth promoting gene. When it is over expressed, is is associated with Wilm's tumour (childhood kidney cancer).</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.</li><li>Decitabine acts on an enzyme that methylates DNA (an enzyme that places a methyl group on DNA) : it inhibits the activity of the enzyme. Therefore, using decitabine make the amount of methylation decrease when the cells divide (as methylation is a mitotically heritable mark).</li><li>Cancers can be caused by overexpression of a methyltransferase. Indeed, if the enzyme is overexpressed, part of the DNA that shouldn't be methylated, and therefore, part of the DNA that shouldn't be silenced, are methylated and silenced. For example, hypermethylation can lead to silencing of a tumor suppressor gene : there is no mechanism to control cell growth anymore. Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome : it has be found that DNMT3 was mutated in this syndrome. Decitabine blocks DNMT3 activity, methylation decreases while cells reproduct, tumor suppressor gene can be reactivated, tumor cells decrease.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome : DNA methylation is indeed a mitotically heritable epigenetic mark. Hypomethylation or hypermethylation of a part of the DNA will be passed to all the offspring cells produced by mitosis.</li><li>A sensitive period is a period during which a major part (but not all) of the epigenetic marks is removed and reprogrammed. Repeats always stay methylated.</li><li>Pre-implantation developpement and germ cells développement are sensitive periods. Imprinting marks are only removed and reprogrammed during germs cells developpement.</li><li>Treating parents during sensitive periods would be inadvisable. Cancers and various syndromes are due (in part or not) to mistakes in the epigenetic marks, and especially mistakes in DNA methylation. Treatment during sensitive periods can disturb the epigenetic mechanisms : abnormal methylation of repeats would lead to genomic instability (that may produce abnormal karyotype), or some imprinting marks can be lost, especially while pre-implantation period, period during which imprinting marks shouldn't removed and reprogrammed. E.g. Will's syndrome, a childhood cancer, is due to mistakes in DNA methylation : loss of imprinting by methylation of the maternal allele.</li></ul></div>
