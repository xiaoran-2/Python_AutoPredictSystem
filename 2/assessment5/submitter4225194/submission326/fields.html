    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is altered in many different ways in cancers. In one case, normally, DNA methylation is limited at CpG islands of the tumor suppressor genes, which are often allowed to be expressed for proper control of cell proliferation. However, in cancers, at these promotors, the CpG islands are hypermethylated, which mollifies the expression of these critical regulatory genes. Additionally, in cancers, oncogenic promoting genes may have their promotors become <em>hypo-</em>methylated, allowing over expression of tumor promoting genes.<br /><br />In a separate phenomenon, DNA methylation normally occurs in high levels at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This serves to suppress translocations and promote general chromosome stability. However, in cancer cells, DNA is globally hypomethylated, which allows for genome instability that contribute to the development of cancers. Specifically, repeats are activated and aberrant transposition of chromosomes occurs, which can be characteristically identified by abnormal karyotype profiles. There is also overall disruption to expression important genes such as V^xy and Axin^fu, as well as activation of undesired, cryptic promotors or splice sites.<span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can lead to cancers because alterations in DNA methylation at imprint control regions (either hypo- or hypermethylated) can lead to loss of control for growth restricting genes and/or overexpression of growth promoting genes. These regions have lost being tightly regulated by losing their monoallelic imprint patterns, now having overriding DNA hyper- or hypo methylation patterns on both alleles.<br /><br />In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the maternal allele is normally not methylated at a CTCF binding site. This allows CTCF to bind there, insulating the enhancers from promoting the expression of the upstream Igf2 while the general lack of methylation in the region allows for normal expression of H19. Thus, Igf2 is turned off for a normal maternal allele.<br /><br />Meanwhile, for a normal cell, the paternal allele is methylated at a CTCF binding site, which prevents CTCF from binding at the same site. The lack of CTCF, as well as the methylation of the promotors of H19, allows the same downstream enhancers to instead enable the expression of the now uninsulated upstream Igf2. <br /><br />When imprinting is lost in the region, this is known as Wilm's tumor. There is methylation on both alleles, which blocks CTCF from binding on both alleles and causes the overexpression of Igf2. <span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used for acute myeloid leukemia. It works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), thus it is part of a class of drugs known as DNMT inhibitors.<br /><br />On a global scale, while DNA methylation is decreased in cancer cells, certain imprint control regions that drive tumour growth may have hypermethylation. Decitabine targets this particular trait of certain cancers, such as many haematological cancers, that are hypothesized to be dependent on tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond treatment because they may alter the epigenetic landscape of the genome, which bears heavy influence on the regulation and expression of genes. Precisely because of this, it is imperative to be wary of using these drugs on younger patients or on germ cells, as these drugs may affect and alter development, which in turn may have aberrant lifetime consequences. Particularly sensitive epigenetic periods include the periods where epigenetic reprograming is occurring, such as in early development or in germ cell development. In addition, the coordinated differentiation of cells during development and just overall development in general depend heavily on tightly-controlled epigenetic machinery.<br /><br /><br /></div>
