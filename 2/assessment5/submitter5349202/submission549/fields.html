    <div class="field-value">A normal cell has hypomethylated CpG islands while a cancer cell has CpG islands that are more likely to be hypermethylated. In a normal cell the rest of the genome's intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. In cancer cells the rest of the genome's intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. DNA methylation acts as an alternative to mutations in genes that can silence the tumor suppressor genes (epimutations). If both copies of a tumor suppressor gene are knocked out, this can cause cancer, along with the activation of oncogenes. Hypermethylated CpG islands are different depending on the tumor. There is also hypermethylation of the CpG island shores (the regions surrounding the island). Alterations in the DNA methylation can prevent growth restricting genes from functioning properly or can cause growth promoting genes to overexpress. This can contribute to cancer. <br />Usually DNA methylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements promotes genomic stability. Hypomethylation causes different problems depending on what part of the genome it occurs on. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic intervals causes illegitimate recombination between repeats. Repeats can also be activated and transpose, activating neighboring genes or causing other types of disruption. You end up with additional deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations, all of which lead to genomic instability. <br />Histone modifications will also be present in cancer with genome-wide effects. Here we see added silencing marks and deleted activation marks at the methylation CGIs. Issues arise at every level of epigenetic control.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Cancer genes demonstrate a loss of imprinting. Genes that should demonstrate parental allele expression do not. They are either expressed from both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles. In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the typical methylation pattern of the paternal allele is for the paternal allele to be methylated, with Igf2 expressing on that allele. On the other hand, the maternal allele is unmethylated and Igf2 will be silent on the maternal allele. In Wilm's tumor we can see this loss of imprinting and so instead of having expression of Igf2 on only the paternal allele, it is also expressing on the maternal allele because of hypermethylation. Igf2 is growth promoting and the double expression leads to Wilm's tumor, which is a childhood kidney tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that causes hypomethylation. It turns off DNA methyltransferase, which then turns on tumor suppressor genes. With the tumor suppressing genes working properly, cell growth can be controlled properly, preventing tumor growth. Decitabine is also an anti-metabolite, which prevents the cancer cells from multiplying. If cancer cells cannot reproduce, they die, which will stop a tumor from growing.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The laying down or removing of epigenetic marks can have lasting effects on the epigenome by turning genes on and off.You would not want to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during "sensitive" periods of development, which are periods when epigenetic reprogramming occurs. These sensitive periods are during preimplantation development, when marks are being reset according to cell type, and also during primordial germ cell development. Epigenetic reprogramming occurs during both germ cell development and early embyronic development. Treating a patient during sensitive periods could alter the epigenome in unintended ways. This is especially a concern with younger patients who may be going through germ cell development.</div>
