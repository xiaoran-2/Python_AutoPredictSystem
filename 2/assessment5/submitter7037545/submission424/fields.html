    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In a normal cell the cell methylates
the intergenic regions, repetitive elements and in some instances the introns
of some genes. While the CpG islands, especially those of the tumor suppressor
genes, and most genes are not methylated. CpG islands tend to be found at gene
promoter sites and therefore are protected in most cells from methylation. Methylation
is used as a way to effectively silence specific genes and regions while maintaining
the ability to pass this information on mitotically to daughter cells and retain
the genome. In a cancer cell the methylation seems to be the opposite of a
normal cell, hypermethylation of the CpG islands, and general hypomethylation
of the whole genome. The effects can be dramatic. The cancer cell methylates
the CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes effectively shutting down apoptosis
of the cell allowing for rapid unregulated growth. Although each type of tumor has
different characteristics one of them is different methylation of different CpG
islands of different tumor suppressor genes.  Methylation of the introns, repetitive
elements and intergenic regions effectively maintains intergenomic stability in
a normal cell. Hypomethylation of the genome causes instability. The instability
can cause deletions, recombinations, and insertions. This can cause over
production or activation of oncogenes and or micro RNAs that can target specific
tumor suppressor proteins. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 are unique proteins and
imprint control regions. In a normal cell it is necessary to silence the
maternal copy of Igf2 while expressing the paternal copy. The cell does this by
having the insulating protein CTCF bind the maternal allele. To prevent the paternal copy also
having CTCF bind the cell methylates the imprint control region. The cell also methylates the H19 gene to preventing
paternal expression by heterochromatin spread. Chromatin looping of the preferred gene Igf2 is downstream of the enhancers. CTCF insulates the enhancement of the maternal allele, and promotes the expression of the secondary gene H19. In the paternal copy
the downstream enhancers promote the Igf2 gene while methylation of the H19
gene further insulates it from over expression in the cell. An imprinting disruption
of the H19/Igf2 cluster causes over expression of Igf2 which is an important
growth protein, and why it is heavily expressed during fetal development. Over
expression of this important growth factor causes tumor development. When the
H19/ Igf2 cluster is disrupted it leads to fetal and infant Wilm’s tumor. This
kidney tumor is commonly found in children suffering from Beckwith Wiedemann
syndrome, or a disruption in the H19 / Igf2 cluster.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that binds to
DNA methyl transferase and acts as an inhibitor, by binding to the DNATs it effectively
blocks the cell ability to methylate. This drug blocks DNAT in all cells. But, due
to the fact that cancer cells are rapidly dividing and growing, this effectively
blocks slows the cancer spread. Decitabine is used in AML where the T-cells are
already rapidly developing and the lymphoma causes an over production of T-cells.
This drug blocks by being incorporated into the nucleosome and as the DNAT
comes along it get bound irreversibly to the Decitibine. At appropriate doses
it dose cause DNA demethylation in cancer cells but it can also have other long
term effects and actions that are not yet described.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>We know that epigenetic marks are maintained through
mitotic growth periods in cells and also as cancer progresses we see a global
decrease in methylation while we have an increase in CpG island methylation.
Cancer is also known to be caused by unregulated dividing cells. By targeting
cells methylation and demethylation machinery we can slow tumor growth. Dr. Stephen
Baylin study used a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) and a DNATi, he was
able to slow the growth of the tumor and also allow the cells own machinery to
produce those proteins that are turned off by CpG island methylation to invoke
apoptosis when exposed to chemotherapy. Further the targeting of HDAC also
slows the tumor growth because it is allowing the cell to retain that tight
chromatin modeling around the areas that allow for rapid growth. Because these
drugs affect all the cells of the body globally we would not want to use these
drugs during sensitive periods. The sensitive periods occur when epigenetic reprogramming
occurs in pre-implantation development, also during primordial germ cell
development. Targeting the epigenetic machinery during these periods would be disastrous
from inhibiting x-chromosome inactivation to having both inherited alleles active
like in Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome.<br /></p></div>
