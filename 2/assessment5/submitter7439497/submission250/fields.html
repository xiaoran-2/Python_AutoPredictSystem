    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are usually unmethylated in normal cells. CpG islands usually are included in the promoters, and their methylation leads to silencing of gene expression. There is a hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores in cancer and it differs by tumor type. Hypermethylation of tumor supressor genes leads to their silencing and that can contributes to cancer.<br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated in normal cells, maitaining genomic stability. There is a hypomethylation in intergenic regions and<b> </b>repetitive regions in cancer. This cause genomic instability, and genomic instability can cause cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the parternal allele. So, enchancers are able to influence Igf2 on the parternal allele, and there is expression of Igf2 (H19 is not expressed). The ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele and there is expression of H19 but no expression of Igf2. Hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele, leads to expression of Igf2 both on the parternal and the maternal alleles, and this happens in Wilm's tumor. This contributes to cancer, as Igf2 is growth promoting.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), so it leads to DNA demethylation and that's why this drug can initiate expression of tumor supressor genes and other genes, that are silenced due to hypermethyation of the CpG islands. But all ways of the drug's effect are probably still unknown. Decatibine is similar to 5-azatydine. It binds DNA, then DNMT1 binds the nucleotide so strong that it can never be released. So, the drug depends on replication. As tumor cells replicate very fast, it influences mostly these cells. The drug is used now in rather low dosage, because in high dosage it is very toxic. Decitabine has a good anti-neoplastic effect at these low doses.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark, which is generally associated with gene activity. So, altering DNA methylaton leads to altering gene expression. Dr Stephen Baylin used azacitidine, <span>DNA-demethylating agent. In this case there should be increasing activity of genes, that have hypermethylated CpG islands in their promoters. So, for instance, tumor supressor genes schould become active.<br />Sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogrammng. There are two sensetive periods: early embryonic development and during germ cell development. Treating during sensitive periods with epigenetic drugs will cause mistakes in resetting of epigenetic marks.</span></div>
