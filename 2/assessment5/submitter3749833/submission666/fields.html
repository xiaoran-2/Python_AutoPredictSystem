    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is important to normal cell regulation during gene transcription and X inactivation and the maintenance of imprinted genes at ICR's.  DNA methylation of CpG island is disrupted in cancer by either hypomethylation of  intergenic and repetitive regions or hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes.  Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG island and CpG  island shores contributes to cancer by gene silencing of tumourusuppressor genes, as I mentioned, and are both more frequent and more reversible than mutations in cancer.  This aberrant epigenetic effect increases over time and with age and, as the Knudson hyposthesis states, cancer requires multiple hits in order to manifest.  The aberration of Genome wide hypomethylation in cancer takes the normally methylated intergenic or repetitive regions, destabilizes the genome and is common in tumour-genesis.    Disrupting the intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to transpositions of gene coding or turning on neighbor genes, additional deletions and insertions leading to genomic instability.  Hypomethylation of CpG poor promotors leads to oncogene activation.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors called the DNMT inhibitors which target the epigenetic machinery.  It is an anti-neoplastic drug that is FDA approved for Hematopoetic cancers and being studied for other cancers.  Used in combination with a histone-deacetylase inhibitor it has both treated tumors successfully and/or made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy by somehow changing the tumor cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of imprinting is an early event in cancer.  Disruption of X inactivation leads to aberrant expression of both maternal and paternal alleles  leading to over or under expression.  In Wilm's Tumour hypermethylation of ICR H19/lgf2 cluster causes  the loss of X inactivation, loss of expression of the growth restricting gene and over expression of growth promoting genes.  Normally the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.  CTCF will bind on ICR and H19 will act to silent the expression of the paternal allele.  With loss of X inactivation there will be a double dose of over expression leading to Wilm's Tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">It's all about down stream effects.  Drugs that disrupt the epigenetic machinery could have downstream implications.  For adult cancers the emphasis is on survivability and quality of life and not side effects, as much.<br />Sensitive periods of development should be avoided when treating patients as they are when epigenetic marks are being established. A single cell with an uncorrected error can have down stream consequences.</div>
