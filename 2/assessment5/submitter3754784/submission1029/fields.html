    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell CPG island are hypomethylated in general. Methylation in CPG islands means silencing of gene expression. Small subset of CPG islands that are dynamically methylated between cell types, most retain unmethylated status. Metylation at CPG islands have been mainly studied for the inactive X chromosome.<br />In cancer cells there is a locus specific hypermethyslation in CPG islands and CPG islad shores of tumor suppressor cells. This DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumor suppressor genes in cancer.<br />In a normal cell intergenic regions and repetitive elements are metilated to mantain the genomic stability.<br />In a cancer cell intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. The consecuence of this are illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The methylation pattern of the<b> paternal</b> allele is <b>methylated</b>. So DNA methylation imprint is in the paternal chromosome. CTCF is an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. 
DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding. Without CTCF, DNA
 methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access
 Igf2 to activate. <br /></div>The methylation pattern of the <b>maternal</b> allele is <b>unmethylated</b>. Igf2 will be silenced for the maternal allele because CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers.<br />In Willm´s tumors maternal allele is also methylated and Igf2 is active in both alleles, maternal and paternal. So now you have double dose of Igf2 in comparison to what you saw in a normal cell. In summary, Hypermetylation of ICR produces Igf2 overexpression in Wilm´s tumor. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). Is approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome that is progressed to cute myeloid leukemia or AML.<br />Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, therefore replication dependent.<br />Methytransferase is bound irreversible and it can no longer be released. This means that the action of these methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent so you have to have the cell replicating. So this means that cancer cells which are dividing much more rapidly than most of the other cells in the body will be more severely afected because they are replicating more.<br />The mechanism of action is still unclear and there is a lack of specificity inherent to their machanism of action, it is still unknown if Decitabine could have long term effects on normal cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A senstitive period is a period where epigenome is demethylated to clear epigenetic marks.<br />The sensitive periods of development are Early development (gametes, fertilised egg, blastocyt, epiblast) and PGC  development (primordial germ cells and gametes)<br />Treating patients during sensitive  periods would be inadvisable because it will afetc to their offspring.<br /></div>
