    <h1>Submission 654 from Anon (session_user_id: 7d50c06686b9d3c77d0f653b865ac27a821acb9c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of inhibitors that inhibits DNMT (DNA-methyltransferase).  Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating (hypomethylating) agent and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which is the precusor of acute myelogenous leukaemia.  Decitabine hypomethylates (demthylates) DNA by inhibiting DNA-methyltransferase.  This inhibition would revert the hypermethylation induced gene silencing of tumor suppressor and hence restore the tumor suppressor function.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation governs the basic epigenetic functions, e.g. imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation and formation of heterochromatin.  DNA methylation of the promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expressions -- higher methylation corresponds to increase in gene silencing.  However, the CpG islands which are found in about 60% of the promoters, are generally kept free of methylation.  In cancer cells, promoter CpG islands become hypermethylated which causes silencing of the corresponding gene expressions.  DNA methylation in intergenic and repetitive elements in normal cells maintain <span>suppression of repetitive element transcription and transposition as part of the normal function.</span>  Hypomethylation (demethylation) at normally heavily methylated repetitive elements, including satellites repeats, would therefore lead to genomic instability and oncogene activation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Both Igf2 and H19 genes are imprinted in a complementary manner where paternal chromosomes only express IGF2 and maternal transcribe H19 only.  In paternal allele, the DNA methylation causes the ICR unavailable for CTCF binding and that also silence the H19 promoter and block the H19 expression.  This allows enhancers to access and activate Igf2.  Conversely, in the maternal allele, unmethylated ICR allows CTCF binding, enabling H19 expression and suppressing Igf2 expression by insulating the enhancer from Igf2.  For patient with Wilm's tumor, there is a hypermethylation of ICR, that will result in nonbinding of CTCF to ICR site in the maternal allele.  That means, like paternal allele, H19 in maternal allele will not be expressed but Igf2 will be and results in an excessive overexpression of Igf2.  Disrupting this imprint means a loss in the growth restricting genes (H19) expresssion and overexpression of growth promoting genes (Igf2).  This reduction in tumor suppression ability is one of the factor contributing to cancer, in addition to oncogene activation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There are two potential effects due to DNA methylation: Genome wide hypomethylation and tumor suppressor hypermethylation. Since such epigenetic changes are passed on mitotically, the effect can be endured until it is erased.  Sensitive period can be defined as a period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals or a period of epigenetic reprogramming, i.e. the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks.  The drug probably should not be used during the early period of development, as the specificity and selectivity of the drug that alters DNA methylation is somewhat uncertain and therefore, long term effect on normal cells is also questionable.  </div>
