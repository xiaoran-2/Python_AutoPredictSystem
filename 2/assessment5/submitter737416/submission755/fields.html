    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation
at CpG islands in the promoter regions of genes generally has a gene silencing
effect.  In cancer, global DNA hypomethylation
of CpG islands in the promoters of oncogenes can lead to their activation e.g.
R-RAS in gastric cancer, and hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter
regions of tumour suppressor genes leads to silencing of those genes.  Silencing of DNA repair complexes can result
in microsatellite instability.  </span></p>

<p><span>DNA
methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps to maintain
genomic integrity.  Hypomethylation of
these regions in cancer can lead to genomic instability. Illegitimate
recombination between repetitive elements can generate potentially dangerous insertions
and deletions, while activation of repeats can lead to their transposition
elsewhere in the genome.  Activation of
normally silenced promoters in intergenic regions can interfere with the expression
of neighbouring genes, leading to transcription and translation of aberrant
peptides.</span></p>

<p><span>Changes in DNA
methylation status are mitotically heritable and rapidly selected, but the
contribution of DNA methylation to the development of a particular tumour is dependent
on the origin, type and location of the tumour, and the stage of the disease.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypo- or
Hypermethylation of imprinted genes can lead to an increase in the expression
of growth-promoting factors or a decrease in the expression of growth-suppressing
factors, both of which are commonly seen in pre-neoplastic tissue.</p>

<p><span>In the
H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal ICR is methylated.  This methylation blocks the binding of the
insulator protein CTCF at the ICR and allows DNA methylation to spread to the downstream
H19 promoter which silences it.  This in
turn allows enhancers downstream of H19 to act on Igf2 and activate expression.</span></p>

<p><span>The H19/Igf2
ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated, allowing CTCF binding and expression
of H19.  Igf2 remains inactivated.</span></p>

<p><span>Hypermethylation
of the ICR on the maternal allele means CTCF cannot bind and so both Igf2 alleles
are active; the resulting over-expression of Igf2 is seen in a condition known
as Wilm’s tumour, a cancer of the kidneys commonly found in children.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNMTs
provide a mechanism for the maintenance of methylation marks in daughter cells during
replication. Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor (DNMTi) that leads to replication
dependent hypomethylation.  Decitabine is
an analogue for the nucleoside cytidine, and is incorporated into the genome
where it binds DNMTs and prevents DNA synthesis from continuing during
replication, leading to cytotoxicity.  As
tumour cells replicate faster than normal tissue such drugs may be used to specifically
target and kill cancer cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation
is mitotically heritable due to the action of DNMTs, so there is a strong chance
that any additional DNA methylation would be passed on to daughter and grand-daughter
cells during replication until such marks were actively erased enzymatically.  However, once DNA methylation marks are removed
they are permanently erased, so the effects of a de-methylating drug could last
longer than the treatment period.</span></p>

<p><span>During development
there are periods of epigenetic reprogramming known as ‘sensitive periods’, such
as early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development, where any
treatment with drugs that alter DNA methylation could disrupt the establishment
of correct parental imprinting and affect subsequent growth and
development.  It would be safest to avoid
treating any child going through puberty, and likewise any pregnant woman or a man
who was trying to father a child.</span></p></div>
