    <h1>Submission 217 from Anon (session_user_id: b275c9c772d15f99ef954952a984e154f98f86ea)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine belongs to DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi) which among the first epigenetic drugs proposed for use as cancer therapeutics.<br /></div><div>These nucleoside analogs get incorporated into the DNA of cells during replication and inhibit DNA methylation by binding DNA methyltransferases irreversibly.</div><div>Low dosage of Decitabine induced DNA demethylation activates tumor suppressor genes aberrantly silenced in cancer. In this way, Decitabine causes growth inhibition in rapidly dividing tumor cells.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><div>In normal cells, CpG islands are generally unmethylated and kept free of methylation independent of their activity state, allowing for a transcriptionally active open chromatin structure. <br />However, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated that contribute to a silent chromatin structure. </div><div>During tumorigenesis, tumor suppressor gene promoters with CpG islands become hypermethylated, resulting in the formation of silent chromatin structure and aberrant silencing of the underlying genes. In contrast, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated which resulting in their aberrant activation .</div><div>DNA site-specific hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters can leads to inactivation of their downstream targets. Epigenetic silencing of such tumor suppressor genes can lead to tumor initiation by serving as the second hit in the Knudson’s two-hit model.</div><div>Loss of DNA methylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions leads to aberrant activation of such genes and non-coding regions that promoting chromosomal rearrangements, thus increasing genomic instability. This DNA hypomethylation increased genomic instability contributes to cancer development and progression through a variety of mechanisms.</div></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>H19/Igf2 is a cluster of genes that undergo genomic imprinting. A region of DNA known as imprint control region (ICR) controls the parent-specific imprinting of both the H19 and Igf2 genes. </div><div>Normally, ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated and bound by a protein called CTCF. CTCF is an insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. So the maternal copy is inactive. <br />In contrast, ICR is methylated on the paternal allele which blocks the binding of CTCF. Without insulator action, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter while downstream enhancers are free to act on Igf2 to promote Igf2 expression. In a word, Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele.</div><div>In Wilm’s tumour, hypermethylation of ICR leads to a loss of imprinting (LOI). H19/Igf2 cluster is no longer paternal imprint, both the paternal and the maternal copies of the gene are active, increasing the production of Igf2. </div><div>This hypermethylation-induced pathological biallelic expression results in an increased amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 which stimulates the growth of tumor cells and prevents damaged cells from being destroyed. In this way, LOI associated with overexpression of Igf2 plays an important role in the onset of human cancers.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable because DNMT1 recognises hemi-methylated DNA and restores methylation on both strands; TET proteins involved in active demethylation are only expressed at very restricted times in development. </div><div>The drugs that alter DNA methylation like Decitabine, binding DNA methyltransferases(e.g.DNMT1) irreversibly leads to the failure to maintain methylation. DNA methylation changes by epigenetic drugs leads to enduring effects on the epigenome beyond the period of drug treatment by its mitotically heritable feature.</div><div>Sensitive period is when altered factors like drugs have an effect on epigenetic control. </div><div>I think there are two sensitive periods of development. One is in primordial germ cell development, the second is the pre-implantation and later specific stages of differentiation. In these two periods, epigenetic marks are removed and reprogrammed.</div><div>Treating patients during sensitive periods may disturb the normal active remodelling of the epigenome, leads to other diseases and potentially transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.  As DNA methylation is mutagenic but helps to maintain genomic stability and essential for viability, it is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods. </div></div>
