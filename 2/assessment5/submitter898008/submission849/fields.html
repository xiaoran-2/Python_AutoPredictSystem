    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:

    <div class="field-value">In normal cell, most CpG islands in the promoter area. So when these CpG islands be methylated, let DNA steam binding tightly with histones. Then, transcription factors can't bind onto promoter, so DNA silence. In the other hand, some methylated of intergenic regions upregulated DNA exporession, because of methylated in these regions are also the position histone be methylated. Then, histones can't bind on DNA prefectly. <br />In cancer cell, due to disruption of DNA methyltransferase, let normal regions of CpG islands in the promoter can't be methylated. Then, histones can't still bind tightly with DNA stream, and transcription factors can bind on the promoters. So, in cancer cell, DNA always be expressed, and can't stop in normal downregulated methods.Contrast with normal DNA intergenic regions, these regions be methylated in cancer cell, In this situation, can upregulation gene expression in cancer cell.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine in an anti-cancer drug, it belongs a demethylation drug by increasing DNA methylation to inhitior gene expression.It is a chemical analogue of the cytosine nucleoside used in DNA, and at low dose,it inhibition of DNA methyltransferase then causing hypomethylation of DNA to inhibit cancer gene expression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Genomic imprinting is resulting in parent-of-origin-dependent gene expression, which mainly achieved by DNA methylation. IGF is form paternal and H19 is from maternal. </span>H19 is a large non-comding RNA, when it be promote, it can inhibit IGF2 methylated to let IGF2 silence. On the other hand, when IGF2 methylated , it can be expressed and inhibit the expression of H19, </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">He shown that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. This result was notable for two reasons, one is epigenetic drugs had been deployed successfully against a solid tumour and, second, some of the participants in Dr Baylin's study who did not show much response to the trial itself then went on to show an unexpectedly good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them next.The <span>epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased,so this is why epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</span></div>
