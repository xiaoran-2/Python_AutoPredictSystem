    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><i><span>In normal cells CpG islands are hypomethylated whereas introns,
intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. In cancer cells
what we see is the opposite:  CpG islands
are hypermethylated and introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are
hypomethylated. Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands can contribute to
cancer as it can for example silence a tumor suppressing gene or also enhance
the expression of an oncogene. Moreover, alteration of methylation in
intergenic regions and repetitive elements cause DNA instability and can lead to
mutations.</span></i></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><i><span>In H19/Igf2 cluster, ICR is methylated in paternal allele. This way
enhancers act promoting Igf2 expression (an oncogene) and silencing H19
expression (a tumor suppressing gene). Additionally, ICR methylation spreads to
promoting region of H19 contributing to its silencing. In maternal allele, ICR is <strong>not
</strong>methylated, which enables CTCF to bind to it modulating enhancers that now activates
H19 expression rather than Igf2. Wilm’s tumor is characterized by the occurrence
of both alleles methylated at ICR (duplicated paternal imprinting), thus there will twice as many expression of
the oncogene Igf2 and no expression of the tumor suppressing gene H19, leading to cancer.</span></i></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><i>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic
syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. This kind of cancer is characterized by the hypermethylation of specific regions of DNA. The treatment with Decitabine prevents hypermethylation </i><i>of DNA by inhibition of a class of enzymes called DNA methyltransferases, thus having an anti-tumor effect.</i></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><i><span>During the pre-implantation period and primordial germ cells development it happens a series of epigenetic events that will endure on the epigenome. These periods are called sensitive because it is when epigenetic marks are more likely to be altered by different factors (including some drugs) and transmitted mitotically to daughter cells. Once these marks (DNA methylation for example) are acquired during these periods, they will be preserved and cannot be modified anymore. That's why the effects of some epigenetic drugs used for treating cancer last even after treatment is over. For the same reason, treating patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods would be inappopriate. The changes on the epigenome would be maintained and trasmitted with possible severe risks even to future generations.</span></i></p></div>
