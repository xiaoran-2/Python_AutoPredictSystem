    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands are normally unmethylated or hypomethylated; whereas, in cancer cells CPG islands have been disrupted and are more likely to be methylated or hypermethylated.  Normally CpG island hypermethylation may occur in association with a single gene or in groups of genes CIMP or CpG island methylator phenotype.  These are places in the genome where higher levels of methylated CpGs than normal are found.  In general, these disruptions or insults contribute to cancer because hypermethylated CPG islands, in the promoters of tumour suppressing genes, silence both copies of those tumour suppressor genes which when active would normally stop or slow down tumour growth or oncogenes multiplying rapidly.  Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are more frequent areas in the genome than CpG islands and they are normally methylated in normal cells and help keep the genome stable, but in cancer cells they become hypomethylated and so promote genomic instablity which is a characteristic of cancer.     </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In general the disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer because both parental alleles are expressed or silent, instead of normally only one parental allele being expressed while the other is silent.  In cancer, imprinted genes get expressed from both parental alleles because of either hypomethylation or hypermethylation at imprinted control regions (ICR) associated with them. An imprinted gene which normally restricts growth may be silenced or an imprinted gene that normally promotes growth may be activated too much. Disruption of the H19/Igf2 cluster is associated with Wilm's tumour.  In a normal cell, Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele, but silenced on the maternal allele. Igf2 is active on the paternal allele because it is activated by the effect of enhancers downstream.  Igf2 on the maternal allele is silent because the enhancers are blocked by CTCF which is bound to the ICR.  In a Wilm's tumour cell, the ICR on the paternal and maternal alleles are both methylated: i..e., on the maternal allele no CTCF is bound, the enhancers are not blocked and Igf2 gets expressed too. The result is that Igf2, a growth promoting gene, gets expressed twice or over-expressed and that promotes more rapid tumour growth.     </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Re the class of epigentic inhibitors, decitabine is a DNMT or DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  DNMT normal lays down methylation on DNA wrapped around the histones and the drug, decitabine, counteracts this activity of DNMT or demethylates the DNA. The drug is being used to treat patients with haematogical tumours.  This type of cancer is driven by too much methylation of tumour suppressor genes thus rendering them silent.  Athough the mechanism underlying decitabine is not completely known, it has been successful in targetting DNMT, counteracting its methylation, and activating the tumour suppressor genes.     </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Long-lasting effects on the epigenome may occur because alterations to DNA methylation are mitotically heritable and cancerous cells have a competitive advantage over other (normal) surrounding cells, thus allowing the cancer cells to divide and spread.  Drugs targeting specific epigenetic machinery may succeed in reversing alternations in DNA methylation while setting up inheritable changes in cells multiplying free of cancer. But, in adult with cancer, the sensitive periods (primordial germ cell and embryonic development) are not in play.  In those periods, the epigenome is more susceptible to changes through the reprogramming of certain epigenetic marks (clearing and establishment).  In adult cancers, along with other contributing factors or additional insults to the patient, it may have been initially just one bad cell that divided and multiplied into a tumour.  Using drug therapies on other patients at one of these sensitive periods (e.g., pregnant women or young children with maturing eggs or sperm) would not be a good idea, because the drugs' effects on other (normal) cells in the body are not well understood in many cases.  So, although they may succeed in counteracting certain adverse epigenetic marks associated with specific cancers, they could set up long-lasting, detrimental effects in those patients.     </div>
