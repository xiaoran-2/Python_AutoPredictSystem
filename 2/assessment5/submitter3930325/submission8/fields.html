    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands generally serve to silence the expression of the gene to which the CpG island is attached.  This may serve to suppress expression of a gene whose protein product is not required for that cell type (eg the neurotransmitter genes are likely to be silenced with CpG island methylation in gut epithelium).  In general, normal cells show a pattern of mostly unmethylated CpG islands.<br /><br />In cancer CpG islands are generally hypermethylated.  This leads to silencing of the expression of many genes including tumour suppressor genes.  In fact, often tumour suppressor genes are selectively silenced in cancer cells.  When these genes are silenced and not expressed there is dysregulation of the cell cycle leading to increased cell survival and proliferation.<br /><br />The normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to ensure chromosome stability and genomic integrity.  Repetitive elements often have strong promotors which, if not methylated, lead to transcription of RNA and the ability to transpose to other regions in the genome.  If not bound up in heterochromatin these regions also have a tendency to allow illegitimate recombination between chromosomes (resulting in a translocation).  In this way, methylation of these regions ensures genome integrity.  Methylation in addition to other epigenetic marks at intergenic regions contributes to chromosome stability by providing structure, eg centromeres and telomeres.<br /><br />In cancer, there is a tendency to genome wide hypomethylation at these regions.  By the mechanisms listed, this leads to translocations, deletions, duplications and insertions by eliminating the stabilising function of methylation at these regions.  Some cancers are driven by genomic instability, and also in this way epigenetic changes can lead to genetic changes by providing further tumorigenic events in the form of activating translocations whereby a strong promotor is spliced to an oncogene which is usually silenced.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele at the IGF2/H19 cluster has a methylated ICR.  This methylation does not allow binding of the insulator factor CTCF.  Downstream enhancers are able to bind to the IGF2 gene and allow its expression.  Hence IGF2 is expressed on the paternal allele. Methylation also spreads downstream to H19 silencing it also.<br /><br />The maternal allele at the IGF2/H19 cluster has an unmethylated ICR.  CTCF can bind to this region and acts as an insulator.  Downstream enhancers are prevented from binding to their preferred site at IGF2 and are instead directed to H19 which is expressed on this allele.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour there is biallelic methylation at the IGF2/H19 cluster.  CTCF is prevented from binding at either allele and IGF2 is expressed from both alleles.  This leads to overexpression of IGF2 which contributes to cell proliferation and increased survival.  This is an early event in the development of Wilm's tumour and can be seen in nephrogenic rests before they transform to malignancy.  Further "hits" are needed for malignant transformation.  Disrupted imprinting at this cluster is seen in the germline in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  Not surprisingly children with this syndrome have an increased risk of Wilm's tumour as well as other malignancies.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that acts as a DNA hypomethylating agent by being incorporated into DNA at replication and irreversibly binding DNMT1 leading to its degradation - probably through ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation.  Although it is referred to as a demethylating agent it does not actively demethylate DNA, rather it prevents methylation of daughter DNA strands at DNA replication.<br /><br />Cancer genomes are generally hypomethylated, but there may be hypermethylation associated with tumour suppressor genes, silencing them and leading to increased cell proliferation and survival and hence tumourogenicity.  If this methylation can be reversed, or at least prevented from propagation in daughter cells this may prevent the cells from continuing to proliferate and may, in fact, induce apoptosis.  This seems to be the case in MDS and AML where improved outcome is reported.  Caution is needed however as inducing hypomethylation in normal cells may have unintended consequences.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">By their definition epigenetic marks must be mitotically heritable.  Alterations in the epigenome in cancer cells lead them to immortalisation and rapid turnover by the mechanisms explained above.  The alterations are passed to all daughter cancer cells.  Epigenetic alterations can also lend resistance to standard chemotherapeutics.  If the altered epigenetic state of every cancer cell is changed back towards normal - for example by preventing DNA hypermethylation - then this alteration will also be passed on when the cell divides, even without the ongoing presence of the epigenetic drug.  Altering the epigenetic state may reduce resistance to standard chemotherapy in an ongoing way by this same mechanism.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a period of time where epigenetic changes in normal cells are happening rapidly such as during early embryonic development and during the development of primordial germ cells ie pregnant women and children.  Any environmental effect - diet, cellular stress, drugs - which has an potential influence on epigenetic state is likely to have a more potent effect on the epigenome during these periods.  Drugs which target epigenetic state may have devastating effect on normal cells during this period by preventing the clearing or laying down of necessary epigenetic marks.</div>
