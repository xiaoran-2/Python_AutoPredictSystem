    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">In cancer cells, DNA methylation aberrations include hypermethylation in promoter regions of umour suppressor genes, and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. DNA methylation in CpG islands are associated with gene silencing. In normal cells, these CpG islands in promoter regions are usually free of methylation. However, in cancer cells, these CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which causes silencing of the associated genes, typically in the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes, causing uncontrollable growth of cancerous cells. Moreover, cancer cells show hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements which are usually methylated to maintain genomic stability. The hypomethylation in these regions in cancer cells, cause illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats, transposition and cryptic promoters, and disruption of neighbouring genes. These genomic instability could in turn give rise to more mutation in favour of cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The alteration in DNA methylation in cancer cells, either hypermethylation or hypomethylation can cause loss of imprinting, and these imprint genes are usually associated with cell growth. For example, the H19/Igf2 cluster, in paternal allele, the DNA methylation in ICR (imprint control region) blocks CTCF (an insulator protein) binding so that the downstream enhancers can activate Igf2 expression. In maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, CTCF is therefore able to bind and insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers. The enhancers instead activate H19 expression in maternal allele, which is not expressed from paternal allele. In Wilm's tumour, because of hypermethylation, both ICRs in paternal and maternal alleles are methylated, resulting Igf2 expression from both alleles. Because Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, this over expression cause Wilm's tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. As nucleoside analogue DNMT inhibitor,<span> Decitabine</span> irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA upon replication, therefore cause DNA demethylation. Because its action is replication dependent, and cancer cells are replicating a lot more than normal cells, they will be affected the most.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Because epigenetic marks are mitotic heritable, they are passed to divided daughter cells. When epigenetic drugs affect the epigenome of the tumour cells, the changes are long-lasting till the affected cancer cells are erased. However, normal cells could also be affected during the treatment and these affects are also long-lasting. Therefore, treating patients during sensitive periods, i.e. periods of epigenetic reprogramming should be cautious. The sensitive periods include early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. In these periods, because the epigenetic marks are actively reprogrammed and sensitive to environment changes, epigenetic drugs will greatly affect this programming and cause harmful effect to developing embryos or developing germ cells</span>.</div>
