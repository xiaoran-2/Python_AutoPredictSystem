    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">When normal tissue turns into cancerous tissue the overall level of DNA methylation decreases genome wide , but at specific loci it increases. <br /><br />Specific loci:<br />Normally CpG islands do not have DNA methylation, and the genes they promote are active. In cancer DNA methylation of CpG islands is very common. The identity of the hypermethylated CpG islands varies by tumour type, but it happens at tumour suppressor genes, DNA-repair genes, genes coding for apoptosis, genes involved in cell cycle development etc. As the DNA metylation will silence such genes, the cell will not be able to suppress tumour growth.<br /><br />Genome-wise:<br />Normally genome wide DNA hypermetylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements occurs. This gives genomic stability. In cancer, as a general rule, there is a genom-wide hypomethylation and as the cancer invasion develops, the DNA methylation decreases.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting of the H19/lgf2 cluster can lead to Wilm's tumour. In a normal cell the paternal allele expresses lgf2 as its imprint control region (ICR), which acts as a suppressor for lgf2, is methylated and therefor inactive, whereas the maternal allele does not express lgf2 as the IRC is unmethylated and hence active.<br />If the ICR in the maternal allele gets methylated, it will act as the paternal allele and both alleles will express lgf2. In such case of hypermethylation, lgf2 will be overexpresed. Lgf2 is a growth promoting gene and overexpression of it is associated with a form of cancer known as Wilm's tumour.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an DNA methyltransferace inhibitor. When decitabine is used there will be less DNA-metylation in the cells. In case of a cancer cell of the kind which is driven by suppressing the cell's tumour suppressers, this kind of drugs will have anti-tumour effects. It is because the inhibition of DNA-methylation of the CpG-islands at the promoters of the tumour suppressor genes, will enable the tumour suppressors to be active and act towards suppressing the tumour.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As altered DNA methylation will be passed on to the following cell generations through mitosis, the effect of epigenetic drugs will last beyond the period of treatment and can have permanent effects on the epigenome. However, as epigenetic drugs act on all cells in the organism, not only on the cancer cells, care must be taken to avoid devastating side effects.  For this reason treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable. A sensitive period of an organism's development is a period with <span>heightened epigenetic sensitivity, such as in early development right after gestation and during germ cell development. Therefor treatment with epigenetic drugs should not be given to pregnant women as it will affect the unborn child. Other sensitive periods are after birth and during childhood as different tissue develop and mature at different times during childhood, including the gamets, and therefor alterations of the epigenome will have effects not only for the lifetime of that person, but also for future generations.</span><br /><br /></div>
