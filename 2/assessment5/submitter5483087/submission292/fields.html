    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the 5th Carbon and a common form of epigenetic programing that almost exclusively occurs at CpG dinucleotides in mammals. This occurs symmetrically on complementary strands of DNA, making the epigenetic marks mitotically heritable. In mammals, this feature occurs because DNMT3a and DNMT3b (DNA methyltrasnferases) methylate hemi-methylated strands upon DNA replication. CpG islands, clusters of CpG dinucleotides, are most commonly associated with gene promoters and methylation silences these genes through either the formation of a repressive chromatin structure or competitive inhibition of sites normally bound by transcription factors. In addition, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually silenced through methylation due to their contribution to genomic instability (transposition, cryptic promoters, illegitimate recombination). <br /><br />Common hallmarks of cancer include a corruption of these processes - specifically, locus-specific DNA hypermethylation and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. The progression of cancer includes the increased expression of oncogenes and a decreased expression of tumor suppressor genes. In turn, there is an increase in DNA methylation (silencing) at specific tumor suppressor gene promoter CpG islands. Clusters of genes have been described for various forms of cancer showing consistently and frequently silenced tumor suppressor regions (CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP)). This can also extend to neighboring region 'island shores'.<br /><br />Finally, a common hallmark described in cancer is a genome-wide reduction in methylation. This reduced silencing of repetitive elements and intergenic regions contribute to genomic instability through increased transposition, cryptic promoters and illegitimate recombination. In addition, hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can activate specific oncogenes which aid in cell survival and replication - promoting tumor growth. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Monoallelic gene expression is created through clusters of genes that are imprinted in a parent-of-origin manner. These imprinted genes are determined and controlled by Imprint Control Regions (ICRs) and are maintained through the organisms lifetime, only being reset in primordial germ cell development. Although ICR DNA methylation varies with each locus, one form of the molecular mechanisms is the silencing of Igf2. Methylation on the paternal ICR prevents the insulator protein CTCF from binding 'spreads' to the adjacent H19 promoter, silencing its expression. In turn, nearby enhancers are available to act on the Igf2 gene and allow expression. On the maternal allele, CTCF binds, and the enhancers promote H19 expression - Igf2 expression is not promoted. <br /><br />One hallmark of cancer is the hypermethylation of ICRs and the subsequent loss of imprinting and genomic stability. For the H19/Igf2 cluster, hypermethylation results in ubiquitous prevention of CTCF binding and in turn, over expression of Igf2 (an oncogene). Increased Igf2 increases the rate of cell growth, thereby propagating tumor growth and proliferation. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that is currently on the market to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which eventually progresses to myelogenous leukemia. As aforementioned, hypermethylation of specific locus', usually correlated with tumor suppressor genes, is a common hallmark of cancer. In order to counter this action, Decitabine removes the silencing DNA methylation marks and allows the expression of tumor suppressor genes that can combat the high rate of growth and proliferation seen in tumorous cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation, or any epigenetic mark, has enduring effects on the epigenome due to its mitotic heritability. Epigenetic marks are passed on from parent to daughter to granddaughter cells because DNMT3a and DNMT3b act on hemi-methylated replicated strands of DNA, preserving the silencing/activating signals. <br />However, there are critical periods in an organisms life where these epigenetic marks should not be altered - 'sensitive periods'. During primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development, epigenetic marks are removed and reapplied or 'reprogramed'. This is when the organism is most susceptible to environmental influences and where drug administration can have a significantly pronounced effect. If a drug prevents or degrades methylation and it is administered during these periods, there could be genome-wide hypomethylation (another hallmark of cancer) and the appropriate epigenetic marks that silence repetitive elements, intergenic regions, imprinted genes or others would not be laid down. In turn, there would be a significant increase in genomic instability and the chance of tumor formation and other conditions resulting from aberrant genetic stability. </div>
