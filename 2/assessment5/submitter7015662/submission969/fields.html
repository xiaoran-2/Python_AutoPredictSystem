    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands are found in around 60% of gene promoters and they usually are hypomethylated independently of the activation state of the gene. In cancer, it as been observed hypermethylation of CpG island, which often occurs in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. This hypermethylation on tumor suppressor genes promoters leads to a silenced expression of this genes, which contributes to cancer. Moreover, since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and epimutated cells are rapidly selected over the normal cells, the disruption of DNA methylations at CpG islands represent an important "hit" in cancer development. <br />Otherwise, DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to genomic stability, preventing the chromosomes to suffer deletions, translocations and insertions. In cancer cells, there is a hypomethylation on intergenic regions and in repetitive elements, inducing genomic instability, which leads, for example, to develop ICF syndrome, where is hypomethyletion of peri-centromeric repeats. This syndrome in particular, occurs because of a mutation of the enzyme DNMT3B, which is a "de novo" methyltransferase, but all the DNA methylation alterations in cancer, such as CpG islands hypermethylation and <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements hypomethylations, are due to mutations in epigenetic regulators like DNA methyltransferases and proteins that have methyl-binding domains, for example.</span><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, the imprinted control region (ICR) is methylated, which produce that enhancers favors the expression of Igf2, while in the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, so CTCF "insulates" the Igf2 expression, and allows the enhancers to favor the expression of the H19 gene. In Wilm's tumour, both alleles had their ICR methylated, which produces that also maternal allele expresses Igf2, leading to a cell that have double expression of Igf2. Since Igf2 is a growth promoter factor, the double expression of this gene induce overgrowth of the tissue, inducing tumor progression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a cytidine analog which works as an DNA-demethylating agent. Briefly, it reduced the DNA methylation by inhibiting the DNA methyltransferases activity. As the article says, patients treated with azacitidine, a drug very similar to decitabine, in combination with a histone-desacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), shown a slow in tumor growth in patients with lung cancer. This implies that, as azacitidine, decitabine combined with an HDACi could reduce tumor progression and maybe have a anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Given the fact that DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects even in the "daughter cells" if the treated is actively dividing. This implies that, if a particular drug changes the methylation state of the DNA in a dividing cell, as cancer cells, all the cell lineage generated by this cell will have the same DNA-methylation state even in the absence of the drug. Because of this, it is important to have in mind that there are certain periods when an organism is sensitive to changes in DNA methylation since it can affect the imprinted genes, for example. This sensitive periods are mainly two; the early development of the embryo, and in the development of primordial germ cells. Treating the patients in this sensitive periods would affect the cell reprogramming, having several effects over the correct gene expression in the whole organism.<span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>
