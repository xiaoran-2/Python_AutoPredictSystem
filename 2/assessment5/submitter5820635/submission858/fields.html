    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"> Methylation at CpG islands is important phenomenon is locking the genes.it plays role in gene expression and is known for years but recently DNA methylation is for cell differentiation and embryonic development..reference,(Suzuki &amp; Bird, 2008),Due to silencing of tumor suppressor genes the cell cycle disturbes and allow the cells to grow uncontrollably .This is due to Hypermethylation of promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Normally the genome is hypomethylated but at some points it shows hypermethylation this is due to micro-organism infection from inflammation or cigarette smoking etc.which slinences the promoters of genes needed to control the growth of cells. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. There is DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer. Hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contribute to disease by causing genome instability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting is the transfer of specific genes from paternal or maternal allele.Maternal allele copy of H19 which is non coding RNA and suppresses growth and Insulin growth factor-2 which is paternal allele copy stimulates the growth.but in cancer they both loose their imprinting as a result there is tumor formation.loss of imprinting in wilim's tumor is due to activation of maternal allele of Igf2 and silencing of maternal H19 allele and aberrant methylation of a differentially methylated region (DMR) upstream of the maternal copy of H19. The protein CTCF is involved in repressing expression of the gene, by binding to the H19 imprinting control region (ICR).There may be parental disomy, where two copies are inherited from one parental chromosome.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating class of epigenetic inhibitors. Decitabine reduces the amount of histone overmethylation. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect because a decrease in histone methylation will allow the expression of previously silenced tumour suppressor genes and therefore stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent.It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.In cancer, decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hDNA methyltransferase inhibitors such as Decitabine trigger demethylation of DNA hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation.It reduces the cell proliferation due to hypomethylation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A particular periods when epigenetic marks are cleared.sensitive periods include germ cell development and early embryonic development. epigenetic marks are being established and inhibiting DNA methylation could have more pronounced effects on the genome at these times thats why it is inadvisable.<br /></div>
