    <div class="field-value"><p>·       CpG islands present in ~60% of promotor regions in normal cells are usually unmethylated.  This is true, whether the gene is active or silent.   Methylation of these regions silences their genes in a tissue-specific manner.  Methylationin other regions is critical in developmental processes such as imprinting, X-inactivation and silencing of repetitive elements.</p><p> CpG islands in cancer cells are likely to be hypermethylated silencing the genes involved.   Hypermethylation of CpG
islands may silence tumour suppressors, such as <i>myc or RB</i>.  The products of these genes are involved with regulation of cell cycle, directing DNA repair or initiating apoptosis when all else fails.  Conversely, hypomethylation of CpG-poor promotors  results in activation, as in the R-RAS oncogene in gastric cancer. CpG island shores surrounding CpG islands have been found to be hypermethylated in cancer cells, altering gene expression .   In some tumours, unusual hypermethylation of CpG-rich sites, termed CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype), first identified in colorectal cancer, identifies a distinct subset of tumours.  </p><p> In normal cells, silencing by methylation of intergenic regions, satellite repeats and repetitive elements such as LINES and SINES in humans  prevents
transposition of transposable elements as well as inappropriate recombination and results in
heterochromatization thereby maintaining genetic stability.  These regions tend to be globally hypomethylated in tumour cells resulting in genetic instability. Genome-wide
hypomethylation supports tumours that are driven by chromosomal instability.  The alterations seen in the cancer epigenome also affects histone modifications and results in deregulation of lncRNAs and changes in nuclear architecture. The alterations in the epigenome seen in cancer cells are useful for diagnosis and prognosis as well as directing theraputic strategies.</p><p></p><span> <br /></span><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>·        
.  <span>Methylation
of the ICR and the H19 promotor on the paternal allele allows downstream
enhancers access to <i>Igf2</i>, activating
its expression.  </span><i></i>The unmethlyated ICR on the maternal allele allows the insulator protein
CTCF and its cofactors to bind, blocking access by enhancers to <i>Igf2 </i>thereby inhibiting its expression.  · </p><p><span>Wilm's tumour, a rare cancer of the kidney seen in children, results from the loss of imprinting due to methylation of
the ICR on the maternal allele resulting in inappropriate expression of <i>Igf2.  </i><i> </i>As a result,</span> a double dose of Igf2 (a growth promoter)
from both maternal and paternal alleles is present, supporting tumour growth., .  Loss of imprinting on the paternal allele would mean a total absence of the growth promotor, Igf2.</p><p></p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>·        
.  Decitabine
is a cytadine analog that functions as a methyltransferase inhibitor. The maintenance of somatic epigenetic marks is accomplished by DNA methyl transferases such as DNMT1.  As a result of inhibiting DNMT1, maintenance
of methylation is lost.    ·Decreasing  methylation of promotor regions of tumour
suppressor regions may result in activation of these genes, creating an
anti-tumour effect.  However, the contribution of DNA methylation depends upon the tumour involved.  For example, demethylation of intergenic regions, satellite repeats and transposable elements may occur in cells that are cycling, like tumour cells, leading to genomic instability. Tumours that are driven by chromosomal instability may be enhanced.</p><p></p><p></p><p> <br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>·        
. Because
DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, changes in the epigenome introduced
by drugs continue to be expressed in daughter cells. Therefore, the effect of epigenetic drugs that may make cancer cells more susceptible to standard chemotherapy will be maintained in subsequent generations of cells.  </p><p>Periods of development when epigenetic
marks are being laid down are particularly sensitive to environmental
influences such as these drugs.  Sensitive periods include mid-gestation, when primordial germ cells are
developing, during maturation of gametes and early development when reprogramming
occurs and epigenetic marks are established in a lineage specific manner.  Drugs that result in alterations of
epigenetic marks during these periods may target other regions of the epigenome
with serious effect.</p><p></p> <br /><p></p></div>
