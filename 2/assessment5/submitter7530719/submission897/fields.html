    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation has many important
roles when looking at CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements
in normal cells. CpG islands are regions of DNA that contain –C-phosphate-G –
repeats that can be methylated. Methylation at CpG islands is almost always
associated with gene silencing (turning genes off). CpG island methylation is
used by our cells to regulate gene expression, something cancer cells take
advantage of. In cancer cells, CpG islands within tumor suppressor genes can be
over methylated while oncogenes are hypomethylated. This change to CpG islands
causes up-regulation of cancer promoting gene expression while shutting
down/dampening gene expression that would limit growth.<p></p>

<span>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and
repetitive elements within normal cells also play a role in gene regulation. Intergenic
regions are areas of DNA that surround genes. Often referred to as “junk DNA,”
these regions have been known to contain gene promoters and enhancers. There is
a growing body of evidence that shows increased methylation not only atCpG
islands but also around them in cancer cells. Methylation can be used as a
biomarker for detection and identification of cancer cells. Increased
methylation of intergenic regions may also be used in the future as a biomarker
and may prove more sensitive than current methylation s for the detection of
cancer cells. Repetitive elements within normal cells are regions of varying
size of repeats (depends on the type of repeat) that are generally found to be
methylated. Repetitive elements within DNA that are not methylated tend to
increase genome instability which is why they tend to be methylated. In cancer
cells you see a hypomethylation phenotype at repetitive elements which promotes
uncoupling of a lot of regulatory functions in cells that can give rise to
cancer cells.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>When looking at both parental alleles of the
H19/Igf2 cluster, you can notice epigenetic differences. The maternal allele has
its IRC region un-methylated which allows the protein CTCF to bind it. This
binding insulates the ICR and shields the gene for Igf2 from downstream
enhancers. This causes the downstream enhancers to act on the un-methylated
H19, driving its expression.  The
paternal allele has its ICR methylated which prevents CTCF from binding.
Because of this, we see methylation of the H19 gene and no shielding of the
Igf2 gene. The enhancers now instead of acting on H19, act on Igf2, driving its
expression and promoting cell growth. In cancer cells, the ICR of the maternal
allele is also methylated, preventing CTCF from binding. Now both alleles drive
the expression of Igf2 (H19 on both alleles is methylated), promoting cell
growth which is awesome for cancer cells. One of the hallmarks of cancer cells
in uncoupling cell growth from cell regulation. This causes rampant cell growth
and cell proliferation, as seen in many cancers including Wilm’s tumor.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating drug that is
currently used as a treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome and cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma. Decitabine acts as a genome-wide DNA-demethylating agent by binding DNA
methyltransferases. Cancer cells have been shown to have an increased amount of
DNA methylation, usually at genes that down-regulate cell growth and
proliferation. Since these modifications are happening generally later in life
of an individual, there is likely up-regulation of methyltransferase activity.
Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferases by binding to them which would slow
down cancer cell growth and proliferation as regulatory gene methylation is
decreased.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Cancer
cells when treated with Decitabine could be more susceptible to standard
chemotherapy because genes that would be silenced by methylation and allow
cells to be susceptible to chemo may now not be silenced. This would be passed
on to daughter cells, opening the doorway for chemotherapy to have an effect. Many genes are methylated in
normal cells to regulate a plethora of functions (Igf2 expression from the
paternal allele in normal cells). Sensitive periods during development are when cells undergo epigenetic
reprogramming, where DNA is un-methylated and then as time passes, is
re-methylated. This happens during early development of a fertilized egg,
pre-implantation and during primordial germ cell development. A pregnant woman
would not be advised to be on this medication as these sensitive periods could
be affected by Decitabine, destabilizing the genome. An example of increased genome
instability during development with Decitabine could be attributed to IRCs being
de-methylated during development. IRCs are methylated
throughout development – you do not see epigenetic reprogramming of IRCs like
you do other regions of the genome. This could change if Decitabine was
present, inhibiting DNA methyltransferases, affecting the rapidly
proliferating cells of the developing fertilized egg. </span></div>
