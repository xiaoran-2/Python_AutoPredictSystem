    <div class="field-value"><p>In general a genome-wide loss of methylation is observed in cancer cells
compared to normal cell. There is an exception, however,  in case of CpG
islands (CGIs) which are observed to be highly methylated in some cancer cells.
CGIs occur often upstream from promoters (ąprox 60% of them) and in
normal/healthy cells are usually not methylated regardless of the gene
activity. Methylation of CPIs is inversely correlated with downstream promoter
activity thus with gene expression. Frequently seen hypermethylation of CGIs in
cancer cells is believed to play role in silencing tumour-suppressor genes.
Mitotically heritable methylation can ensure the down-regulation of
tumour-suppressor genes for the cancer cell line and thus protect them from
apoptosis, stimulate uncontrolled growth or give it other advantages over
neighbouring cells. <br /></p><p>In
case of normal cells, intra- and  intergenic
regions as well as repetitive elemets are usually methylated. Methylation of
CpGs in inter and intragenic regions ensures correct transcription start
arresting alternative starting sites, inhibit antisense transcription and
regulate splicing by marking intron/exon sites. Hypermethylation of repetitive elements (observed for the whole lifespan of healthy individyals) directs their
location to heterochromatin. Overall hypomethylation of genome in cancer in intergenic
regions can influence alternative transcription start, level of antisense
transcripts or splicing. What can have more severe implications is, however,
hypometylation of repetitive elements which results in relaxed chromatin in
repetitive element loci and in case of transposable elements can result in
their activation.  Repetitive
 elements brought into an euchromatin due to their frequent occurrence in
a genome (multiple copies) can stimulate chromosomal rearrangements. Activated
transposable elements can moreover cause insertions, by exciting themselves and
pasting in a new locus (transposons) or by pasting a new copy in a random new
locus (retrotransposons) or can influence neighboring genes expression through
strong promoters located in their terminal repeats.    </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Taking as an example H19/Igf2 cluster we can conclude that changes
in methylation levels can disrupt imprinting. In case of paternal allele
imprint control region (ICR) is obligatory methylated which protects from binding
of insulator protein CTCF to Igf2. Methylated ICR serves an origin loci from
which methylation progress to the promoter of H19 (coding lncRNA). Enhancers
located downstream from H19 can bind to unprotected by CTCF igf2 stimulating
its expression. In case of maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated which allows
CTCF to bind to Igf2 protecting it from enchancers and therefore silencing its
expression. Enhancers choose H19 as their second choice target and stimulate expression
of H19 lncRNA. Igf2 is regarded as oncogene due to its growth promoting
activity. Methylation of maternal ICR causes disruption of imprinting and
result in two parental-like alleles. Igf2 up-regulation (Igf2 is expressed from
two loci instead of one) leads to Wilm’s tumour.    </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is FDA approved drug acting as DNA methyl-transferase  inhibitor (DNMTi). It is a cytosine analogue
that is incorporated into DNA. During replication, DNMT binds to this modified
base irreversibly losing its function, which subsequently results in not
copying the methylation pattern to the newly synthesized strand. Methylation
levels of a cell dilutes in following cell generations. Therefore, rapidly dividing tumor
cells will quickly reduce methylation levels upon exposure to decitabine. Effect of the drug will be more severe to cancer cells than healthy, more slowly dividing cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p><p><span>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable therefore once established can be
sustained by daughter cell lineage. Since many cancer types  show hypermethylation of CGIs causing
silencing of tumour suppressor genes, decrease in methylation can positively
correlate with expression of those genes. When further treated with
chemotherapy newly activated tumour suppressor genes can lead for example to
apoptosis. This woulnd’t be a case when abovementioned genes were silenced by
hypermetylation. </span></p><p>

</p><p>Drugs inhibiting DNA methylation pose a danger since they are not tumour-specific
and acting systemically. As it is known DNA methylation plays important
role in X-chromosome inactivation, autosomal imprinting as well as in regulation
of gene expression and during specialization of embryonic stem cells into
different tissue types. Alteration to DNA methylation can have lethal or severe
life lasting consequences when occurring during sensitive periods of which
pre-implantation period from fertilization to blastocyst formation and primordial
germline development are the most crucial. In these periods epigenetic marks removed and re-established with additional re-establishment
of  imprinting patterns during primordial
germline development. Furthermore, some cell lineages like hematopoetic develop
later in prenatal life or like germline before reaching adolescence. For some cell-types therefore any period before adolescence may be sensitive.  </p></div>
