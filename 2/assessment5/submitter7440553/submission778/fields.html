    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal, non-cancerous cells, CpG islands are typically
hypomethylated (low methylation). Their regulation is an alternative mechanism
of gene regulation, as when they become methylated, downstream genes are
silenced. In cancer cells, CpG islands become hypermethylated (highly
methylated), which can silence genes which oppose tumorigenesis. Target genes
include tumor suppressors, such as Rb or MLH1, which normally oppose cancer
cell proliferation. Once silenced by CpG methylation, these genes are no longer
expressed and cancer cells divide uncontrollably.</p>

<p>In contrast, DNA methylation at intergenic sequences is
typically highly methylated in normal cells and hypomethylated in cancer. Under
normal, hypermethylated conditions, intergenic regions act to maintain genomic
stability by limiting chromosomal rearrangements and closed heterochromatin
state. In cancer, there is an increase in transposition, activation of cryptic
promotoers as well as disruption to neighboring genes. One example of this is
the mutation of DNMT3B, which leads to ICF syndrome and genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer, there is a loss of imprinting which can contribute to pathogenesis One example of this is at the H19/Igf2 cluster. Under normal conditions, the paternal allele is methylated, leading to a lack of CTCF binding and subsequent enhancer expression and increased IGF2 expression. conversely, at the maternal allele, there is a lack of methylation, leading to CTCF binding to H19, resulting in a lack of IGF2. In Wilm's tumor, the paternal allele is still methylated, but the maternal allele also becomes methylated. This results in increased levels of IGF2, which is proliferative. This contributes to cancer through increased cancer cell division and tumor growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Through the inhibition of DNA methylation, decitabine reverses hypermethylation of pro-tumorigenic genes, such as tumor suppressors, restoring proliferative control and apoptosis (cell death) sensitivity. This can render tumors more susceptible to treatment with other anti-oncogenic drugs.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can be mutagenic, as it is prone to cytosine deamination to thymidine. This can results in permanent genetic mutations. Additionally, DNA methylation is symmetrical and can be maintained through cell division through the action of DNA methylatransferases which act upon hemi-methylated DNA. <br /><br />DNA methylation is altered during sensitive periods (a developmental window when the epigenome is sensitive to environmental influences), such as during early development when DNA methylation is cleared in the blastocyst or primordial germ cells). It may be unwise to treat patients during these sensitive periods, as there may be abnormal clearing of epigenetic marks resulting in cancer or other diseases, or mutations which only become apparent in the offspring of patients.</div>
