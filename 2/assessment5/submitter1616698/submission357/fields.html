    <div class="field-value">   Although CG nucleotide are relatively sparse in the human genome, they are  found throughout it.  The majority (99%) of CG dinucleotides are methylated (hypermethylated),. A small percentage (&lt; 1%) are grouped in densely packed CpG islands. These CpG islands are mostly (60%) found on gene promoters . In normal cells, these islands are unmethylated (hypomethylated).  This keeps the way free for these genes to be expressed.<br /><br />   In cancer, on the other hand, CpG islands  are hypermethylated.  As a matter of fact, these hypermethylation is a hallmark of all cancers.  It is viewed as an epigenetic alternative to a genetic mutation , and, since it is mitotically heritable, it is locked in all the cancerous cells.  Since the hypermethylated CpG islands are often found silencing the tumor suppressor genes, the epimutated genes  have an advantage and rapidly take over.  Hypermethylation in cancer spreads from the CpG islands in both directions  for  about 2 kb in what is called the CpG island shores That correlate with gene expression.<br />Different cancers  have particular hypermethylation patterns that are specific to each tumor type.<br /><br />As mentioned above, CG nucleotides found in intergenic regions and in repetitive elements are globally methylated in normal cells. This silencing maintains genomic stability by heterochromatization.  This makes recombination and other illegitimate insults to genomic integrity less likely since these mostly need open chromatin to happen.<br /><br />In cancer, these integenetic and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.  The consequent open chromatin allows  transcriptional errors, transpositions, translocations, deletions, duplications, and insertions.  In short, the hypomethylation of the CGs lead to genomic instability, another salient feature of cancer.  This impaired stability results in aberrant nuclear structure and abnormal gene expression.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at ICRs (Imprinting Control Regions)often behaves differently from methylation mechanism at other CpG islands.  It does not always imply silencing of gene expression.  A good example is the H19/Igf2 cluster of genes. This cluster is paternally imprinted. The DNA methylation is on the paternal ICR which prevents it to bind to the CTCF protein.  This is significant because CTCF is an insulator protein which would block Igf2 from the downstream enhancer.   Since there is no obstacle, DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter. Now that H19 is silenced, the enhancer reach Igf2 and activate it. Thus Igf2 is paternally expressed although the ICR is paternally imprinted.<br /><br />In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated. This allows CTCF to bind to it and prevents the enhancer to reach Igf2 and.<br />in consequence it is not activated.<br />The up regulation of Igf2, an oncogene and growth promoting gene has  important consequences for cancer.<br /><br />In Wilm's Tumor the hypermethylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster results in the loss of imprinting and both alleles are expressed as if they were two paternal alleles with an extra up regulation of the Igf2 growth promoter gene.<br /><br /><b></b></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine  belongs to the class of DNA demethylating agents. It acts as a demethylation drug on the hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes.  During replication, cells incorporate this chemical which inhibits  a protein needed for methylation causing demethylation of that sequence. Since hypermethylation is found predominantly on promoters of tumor suppressor genes, the Decitabine induced hypomethlation of these promoters restores the normal function of the targeted genes.<br /><br />It was also found that in cases in which this drug and others of the same class did not have the desired effect, patients who continued treatment with conventional therapies showed an unexpected improved positive reaction to the treatments.  This could mean that the demethylating agents changed the epigenome in ways that are not completely understood but that may hold promise for the future.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The epigenetic drugs altered the epigenetic markers on cells that will replicate and through the mitotic heritability of the epigenetic state will maintain  that cell identity beyond the periods of drug treatment.<br />Cell identity is maintained in adult cells and marks are conserved. On the other hand, there are periods of active epigenetic reprogramming when marks are erased and new marks are laid down.  These are called sensitive periods. The most important sensitive periods are the time of primordial cell development through the production of mature eggs and sperm. Another sensitive period occurs during pre-implantation and early post implantation.<br /><br />There is also a period of active reprogramming of epigenetic marks during cell differentiation and  also after artificial reprogramming  of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells.<br /><br />These epigenetic drugs work by altering DNA synthesis and/or changing histone behavior and genomic architecture.  Like traditional chemotherapy these mechanism would alter normal epigenetic programming and reprogramming in germ cells and during embryonic development pre and post implantation.  In addition men and women of childbearing potential could also experience genetic and epigenetic  insult.</div>
