    <div class="field-value">Methylation at CpG islands is important for regulating gene expression.  CpG islands are typically found clustered around gene promoters.  Methylated CpG islands lead to gene silencing.  In general, CpG islands are protected from methylation.  Different patterns of CpG methylation are correlated with specific cell types.  Methylation occurs via de novo DNA methyl transferases, and is mitotically heritable.  In certain cancers CpG islands are hypermethylated.  Hypermethylation tends to be locus specific, particularly occurring at tumor suppressor genes.  This leads to silencing of the tumor suppressor, thereby promoting cancer growth.  According to the Knudsen hypothesis, multiple abnormalities are necessary for tumorigenesis.  Silencing of tumor suppressors by CpG methylation may be an important epigenetic contributor to tumor growth.  In contrast, DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements function to promote genomic stability.  In intergenic regions DNA methylation silences cryptic promoters, thereby preventing the transcription of aberrant proteins or by silencing cryptic splice sites to prevent recombination.  DNA methylation of repetitive elements maintains genomic integrity by silencing repeats to prevent transposition either directly by methylation or by the mutation of meC to T, by silencing repeats to prevent the transcription of illegitimate proteins, or by methylation of repeats to prevent inappropriate recombination events.  Hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is frequently observed in cancers.  Hypomethylation releases the silencing functions described above, thus contributing to genomic instability.  Types of genomic instability include illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes leading to abnormal gene, and thus protein, expression.  In addition, deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations are all possible outcomes of disrupted genomic integrity.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Different patterns of methylation are associated with the H19/Igf2 cluster on the maternal and paternal alleles.  Normally, the paternal allele is methylated at both the imprint control region (ICR) and the H19 promotor.  Methylation of the ICR blocks binding of the CTCF insulator protein, allowing downstream enhancers to promote transcription of IGF2.  Methylation of the H19 promotor silences its ability to initiate transcription.  In contrast, the maternal allele is normally unmethylated.  The H19 promotor is active.  Furthermore, CTCF is free to bind to the ICR, thus insulating IGF2 from the downstream enhancers. Instead the enhancers act on the H19 promotor.  In Wilm's tumor, hypermethylation leads to altering the maternal allele so that it now functions similarly to the paternal allele.  The H19 promotor is blocked, and the downstream enhancers are free to activate IGF2 expression.  Importantly, IGF2 is now expressed from both alleles, resulting in an excess of IGF2.  IGF2 is a growth factor, and excess growth factors are one cause of the uncontrolled growth that are associated with some types of tumors.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent that belongs to a class of drugs known as de novo methyl transferase inhibitors (DNMTi).  These drugs act by irreversibly binding methyl transferases.  Inhibiting methyl transferases blocks the passing down of methylated marks during mitotic cell division.  This type of treatment can be effective for reversing the hypermethylation that occurs in certain types of cancers.   Hypermethylation, such as that seen at CpG islands, can silence tumor suppression genes.  Reduced methylation at these CpG islands reverses the silencing of the tumor suppressor, and thus may have an anti-tumorigenic effect.   Knudson's hypothesis says that cancers appear to be due to the cumulative effect of multiple insults to the normal mechanisms that regulate cell division. Drugs targeting abnormal epigenetic processes may therefore have profound therapeutic benefits by decreasing the overall number of abnormalities that underlie a particular cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks, by definition, are stably inherited marks that are passed down mitotically.  For example de novo methyl transferases function to ensure that methylated marks are faithfully transferred to newly formed DNA strands during semi-conservative DNA replication. Thus, not only will the tumor cells exposed to drugs that alter DNA methylation be effected, but their progeny will continue to express the altered epigenetic state even after drug treatment is halted.  However, it is important to remember that there are times during the normal life cycle that epigenetic marks need to be erased and re-set. These times are what are known as "sensitive periods".  Sensitive periods occur during early development between fertilization and implantation, and during formation of primordial germ cells. Offspring exposed to epigenetic drugs during the sensitive period between fertilization and implantation would be susceptible to acquiring abnormal epigenetic marks than could effect their further development.  Furthermore, medication exposure during PGC development could result in abnormal epigenetic marks that lead to defective gametogenesis or abnormally imprinted genes thus negatively impacting a patient's offspring.</div>
