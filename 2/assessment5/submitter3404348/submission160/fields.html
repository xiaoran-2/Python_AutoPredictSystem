    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated.<br />In cancer cell, CpG islands are hypermethylated.<br />CpG islands are promoters of tumor suppressor genes.<br />In cancer cell hypermethylated CpG islands couldn't work  as promoters of<br />tumor suppressor genes, it could happen epigenetically silencing of tumor suppressor genes.<br />In normal cell, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are densely packed,<br />it protect from illegitimate recombination.<br />In the context of cancer we have hypomethylation of these repetitive elements or the intergenic regions. <br />Repetitive elements can also be activated because of the hypomethylation. <br />This means that the repetitive elements have the capacity to actually make a copy of themselves. <br />And jump around the genome or transpose. <br />This can result in consequent problems  where they jump into, that cause disrupt the coding region of a <br />gene and it also may activate neighboring genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In paternal allele, methylated ICR (imprint control regions) is not able to bind insulator element of CTCF. <br />So, Enhancers can make expression of Igf2 genes.<br />Promoter of H19 genes are hypermethylated and inactivated.<br />In maternal allele, ICR is hypomethylated, it can bind CTCF on ICR, it insulate expression of Igf2 by Enhancers.<br />Hypomethylated promoter of H19 genes are expressed by Enhancers.<br />In the case of Wilm’s tumour, maternal allele of ICR is hypermethylated that become no binding of CTCF element <br />then enhancer can access Igf2 to activate and DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence.<br />It become uniparental disomy -paternal UPD- , double dose of Igf2 is growth promoting and <br />this is associated with Wilm's tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.<br />Decitabine inhibit copy of the methylation to the daughter strand, it become demethylated, activated.<br />In case of cancer, tumour suppressor genes are methylated, inactivated.<br />To treat cancer, for example, myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML),<br />much lower doses of Decitabine is good for anti-neoplastic effect (killing the tumour cells),<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation of CpG island, ICR, intergenic region and repetitive element cause altering gene expression,<br />that effects on the epigenome and may causes expressing tumour genes or silencing suppressor genes.<br />For example, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying suppressor gene.<br />To cure cancer by dosage of epigenetic drugs, care about patients age for sensitive period.<br />Sensitive period is a period that environmental changes are strongly affect for developments.<br />Sensitive periods in developments are during primordial germ cell development, early embryonic development and younger age in developing germ cells.<br />Epigenetic drugs are affected not only cancer cells but also every cells.<br />So, dosage of epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.<br /></div>
