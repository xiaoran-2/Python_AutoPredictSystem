    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to repress transcription from the associated gene promoter, i.e. to silence the gene.<br /></li><li>In cancer, there is an increase in the amount of hypermethylation at CpG islands.<br /></li><li>This contributes to cancer by silencing genes that are normally supposed to be active. For example, tumour suppressor genes that inhibit cell growth and division can be turned off by CpG island hypermethylation, allowing the cell to divide out of control.</li><li>The normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to silence the repetitive elements and contribute to genome stability, and to help suppress some genes and miRNAs.</li><li>In cancer, there is a decrease in the amount of methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</li><li>This contributes to cancer by causing the expression of some genes that are normally supposed to be inactive, e.g. by turning on genes that promote cell growth and division. It also causes genome instability by allowing inappropriate recombination between repetitive elements, and increases the DNA mutation rate by blocking the activity of DNA repair enzymes.</li></ul><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>On the paternal allele, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated. This means that the CTCF insulation protein can't bind to the ICR, which means that the gene activation signal from nearby enhancer elements can spread over the ICR to reach the Igf2 gene that's on the other side of the ICR. So the methylation of the ICR means that the Igf2 gene is active / expressed from the paternal allele.<br /></li><li>On the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated. This means that the CTCF protein can bind the ICR, and blocks the gene activation signal from the nearby enhancer elements from reaching the Igf2 gene. So lack of methylation of the ICR means that the Igf2 gene is silenced / suppressed from the maternal allele.<br /></li><li>In Wilm's tumour, there is hypermethylation of the ICR, i.e. both alleles now resemble the methylated paternal allele<br /></li><li>This contributes to cancer by giving the cell a double dose of the Igf2 gene, which causes cell growth and division.<br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.<br /></li><li>Decitabine reduces the amount of DNA methylation.<br /></li><li>DNA demethylation by Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by re-activating genes (such as tumour suppressor genes) that have been silenced by the inappropriate CpG island methylation that's seen in cancer cells.<br /></li></ul><span><br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation patterns are mitotically heritable. i.e. every time a cell that's been treated with drugs that change the DNA methylation pattern divides, it passes on that altered pattern to its daughter cells. The daughter cells pass it on to their offspring. So the effects of the drugs persist through generations of cell divisions.<br /></li><li>A sensitive period is a time during which the genome is especially sensitive to changes in DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks.<br /></li><li>Sensitive periods include early embryonic development (i.e. pre-implantation), and during the development of the germ cells. Both periods are associated with the reprogramming of epigenetic marks.</li><li>Treating patients during sensitive periods could potentially cause off-target, non-specific epigenetic changes that then persist in the body long past the time when treatment stops. If these changes occur in the germ cells, they may potentially also be passed on to the next generation.<br /></li></ul></div>
