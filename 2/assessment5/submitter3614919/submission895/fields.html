    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is one of the main mechanisms of epigenetic control. The CpG dinucleotide can have the hydrogen substituted with methyl in the cytosine base and this alters the binding properties of the DNA substrate. 
<p> The CpG islands are regions of the DNA with heavy density of CpG sequences. A large portion of gene promoters (60%) have CpG islands but these are usually not methylated regardless of the promoter activity state.The CpG islands role is gene imprinting. Imprinting controls less than 1% of genes by allowing expresion from just one of the two alleles and this is an inheritable feature of gene expression.
</p><p> The intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are normaly methylated. This is called genome-wide methylation and provides stability of the genome. When present it repesses transcriptional noise from alternative start sites and inhibits antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing.
</p><p>In cancer, DNA methylation patterns are changed, the CpG islands are hypermethilated while at the same time a hypomethylation is observed genome-wide. Both these changes favor cancer and because methylation is inherited through cell division they are selected features in tumorgenesis.
CpG islands hypermethylation is associated with promoter inhibition which leads to gene silencing. Sometimes the GpG islands shores are methylated rather than the islands with the same effect of gene silencing.Silencing tumor suppressor genes alows cancer to develop by disabling one mechanism that keeps it in ckeck.
</p><p> The genome-wide demethylation increases the genome instability. We observe illegitimate recombinations between repeats, deletions, translocations and insertions. All these are mutations which will alter at some point the expression of either oncogenes by promoting uncontrolable growth or tumor suppressor genes by silencing/deleting them.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells  there is a difference of methylation at an imprint control region (ICR) between the maternal and paternal allele which controls the expression of Igf2 (which is a growth factor).
<p>On the paternal allele the insulator is methylated and doesn't allow binding of a control proteine - CTCF. Enhancers, which are located downstream, will skip the H19 region and act on the Igf2 gene allowing its expression.
</p><p>On the maternal allele there is no methylation of the insulator and this binds with the CTCF proteine. In this case the downstrean enhancers will act on the H19 gene while keeping the Igf2 silent.
</p><p>In Wilm's tumor case both alleles are methylated so that CTCF cannot bind on either chromosomes. In this case both alleles will express the Igf2 gene so they will produce twice as much of the normal amount. Igf2 encourages cell growth and therefore acts as an oncogene. Later in the individual's life when other tumor marks are met these cells will start a cancer of the kidneys called Wilm's cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The decitabine drug is sold as Dacoden by a Japanese company and belongs to a group of DNA-demethylating-agents drugs.
These drugs inhibit methylation and inhibit tumor proliferation by reactivating tumor suppresed genes. In cell division if a cancer daugther cell loses the hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes will revert to a cell which does not divide uncontrollably and the cancer slows its growth.
This drug has been succesfuly used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which lead to myelogenous leukaemia.
<p>Unlike mutations, the epigenetic changes induced by cancers are reversible if they are targeted with a suitable chemical compound which restores the normal epigentic state of a cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is inherited in cell division by the action of the DNMT1 enzime which copies the methylation state of one strand of DNA to the other. The methylation state is preserved through cell lineages in all somatic cells. Methylation is also preserved meiotically by gene imprinting and reprograming of imprinted genes. Altering DNA methylation has efects which can last for several generations.
<p>The periods in development when altered environments have the most effects on epigenetic control are called sensitive periods. There are two most sensitve periods in mammals development: 
</p><ul><li> - the blastocyst stage when the DNA is demethylated genome-wide and cells reach the pluripotentcy state</li></ul><ul><li> - the creation of the primordial germ cells when the imprinted genes are reprogramed</li></ul>
Beside these periods there are other cell specific sensitive time intervals. They are usually childhood periods when certain organs mostly develop. As an example a correlation has been observed between nutrition patterns of 9-12 years old grandfathers and the longevity of the grandchilds.
<p>It's a bad idea to treat patients with epigenetic altering drugs during sensitive periods because each change will be inherited by all daugher cells of the one that is altered and this can also be passed to subsequent generations.
