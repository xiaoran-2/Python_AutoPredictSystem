    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are genome regions with a
higher likelihood of having CpG sites (guanine nucleotide following cytosine
nucleotide in the ADN), and they work as a genetic switch. A CpG island is
usually a gene promoter at the beginning of a gene, and when it is methylated,
the associated gene is inactive and DNA is tighter packaging (heterochromatin).
Conversely, if CpG island is not methylated, gene is active and DNA is looser
packaging (euchromatin).</p>

<p>In normal cells, CpG islands are
globally hypo-methylated. When CpG islands are not methylated, gene promoters
are active, so genes are transcripted producing either associated proteins
through RNA messenger or non-coding RNA in charge of regulation of protein
production. However, in cancer, CpG islands are overall more methylated than
they are in normal cells. This means that gene expression is repressed.</p>

<p>If the gene promoter at these
methylated CpG islands is associated with a tumour repressor gene, this gene
will not be expressed, that is to say, it will not be transcripted, and tumour
cells will grow.</p>

<p>The intergenic regions and repetitive
elements are generally methylated. When intergenic regions and repetitive
elements are methylated, genomic stability is maintained since heterochromatin
is more dense and it avoids gene insertions, deletions or translocations.</p>

<p>However, in tumoral cells, intergenic
regions and repetitive elements are less methylated (or hypomethylated -DNA
methyltransferases decrease) leading to genomic instability. In this case,
chromosomes may be gained or lost, as well as deletion or insertion in a
chromosome. Besides, illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes or
reciprocal translocations between repeats might be produced.</p>

<p><span>Once
genetic instability is laid down, aberrant DNA repair is produced in
heterochromatin, tumour cells are divided without control and cancer
progresses.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The Imprinted Control Region (ICR) in
the paternal allele is methylated: the insulator protein CTCF cannot bind into
it, so enhancers can get to the Igf2 gene, expressing this protein. The
promoter in CpG island of H19 is also methylated, so this gene is not
transcribed (associated lncRNAH19 is not expressed).</span></p>

<p><span>Maternal ICR is not methylated: insulator
protein CTCF can bind to it and enhancers cannot reach the gen Igf2, so that
protein is not generated by the maternal allele. CpG island associated with H19
is not methylated, so H19 can be transcribed (lncRNAH19 is produced) by
maternal allele.</span></p>

<p><span><span>In Wilm’s tumour,
whereas the paternal allele does not change (both ICR and promoter of H19 in
CpG island methylated), the maternal allele is altered (working as paternal
does): both ICR and promoter of H19 in CpG island are now methylated.</span> <span>Maternal
allele produces now Igf2 and doesn’t produce </span> lncRNAH19.</span></p>

<p><span>Long
non coding RNA H19 is produced neither in the paternal allele nor in the
maternal allele, and on the other hand, paternal and maternal allele are
producing Igf2, so there is a double dose of this protein. Igf2 is a growth
promoter, so Wilm’s tumor cells grow uncontrolled.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It
is a DNMTi, that is to say, an enzymatic inhibitors of DNA methyl transferases.
Decitabine is a small molecule which binds to DNA methyltransferases. In
addition to that, Decitabine has also a cytotoxic effect on rapidly dividing
cancer cells.</p>

<p><span>Once that Decitabine  and DNMT are bound, DNA methyltransferases
cannot methylate DNA (transfer of a methyl group to DNA is not possible).
Therefore, DNA will be hypomethylated, as it is in normal cells.</span></p>

<p><span>Some
types of cancer are caused by an over expression of DNMT, so DNA methylation is
pathological high in those cases, 
<span>producing silencing of genes. If those silenced genes are growth
suppressors, the net result is cell division and growth, generating cancer.
However, joining Decitabine to DNA methylatransferases, the amount of effective
DNA methyltransferases available is reduced, cell methylation gets back to
normal levels, and uncontrolled cell growth is suppressed.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are mitotically
inheritable, so they passes from one cell generation to the next one, even
though the treatment has been stopped.</p>

<p>A sensitive period is a stage during
the cycle of life in which the epigenetic reprogramming is higher and with a
global scope, therefore the epigenetical changes are more likely produced.</p>

<p>There are two main globally sensitive
periods: the early development (from the join of sperm and egg until the
blastocyst stage) and the Primordial Germ Cell Development when those cells are
developed in the foetus. There can be other periods in where epigenetic changes
can happen but associated to specific lineages, not globally.</p>

<p><span>Epigenetic
treatments trying to change epigenetic marks in cells. During those sensitive
periods epigenetic changes can potentially affect  <span>to the whole organism, and the result of a
drug not only hit the tumour cells but other normal cells in which epigenetic
effects can be negative, so it is not advisable treat patient in these stages.</span></span></p></div>
