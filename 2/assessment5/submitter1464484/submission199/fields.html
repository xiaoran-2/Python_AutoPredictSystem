    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.- Describe the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands</p><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands regulate the expression of genes in the region. Basically a high dna methylation in the CpG islands will silence CGI promoters related to that island.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2.- Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer. AND</p><p>3.- Explain how disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.</p><p>Cancer disrupt DNA methylation of CpG islands n many ways in some cases/areas the CpG islands are de-methylated allowing the expression of genes that normally should not be expressed and possibly allowing onco genes to express. In the other way (High DNA methylation on CpG islands normally not methylated) will cause genes that normally express in the cell to be silenced possibly some tumor suppressor genes. If oncogenes are expressed it can cause overgrowth (depending on what oncogene is over expressed) and if some tumor suppressors genes are silenced at the same time the the grow cycle of the cell will be disrupted and cells would not be able to repair or kill themselves.</p><p></p><p></p><p>4.- Describe the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p><p>Again the function is to regulate the expression of genes</p><p><br /></p><p></p><p>5.- Describe how DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer. AND<br /></p>6.- Explain how disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to cancer<p>With cancer there is a general hypo methylation in the affected cell which will generally de-methylate intergenic regions allowing onco genes to express.</p><p><br /></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.- Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines        Igf2 expression status.</p><p>The paternal lgf2 allele is hyper methylated preventing enhancers to activate H19 but instead activating lgf2.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2.- Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines        Igf2 expression status.</p><p>The maternal lgf2 allele is not methylated allowing the CTFC insulator to bind allowing enhancers to activate H19 but not activating lgf2.</p><p></p><p>3.- Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour AND</p><p>4.- Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.         </p><p>With Wilm's tumour both allele are methylated causing lgf2 to be expressed in both alleles generating a double dose of lgf2 and disrupting cell growth generating cancer cells.</p><p><br /></p><p></p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1.- Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.              <br />histone-deacetylase inhibitor 2.- Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation. They do de-methylate histones that in cancer are over methylated possibly causing tumour suppressor genes not to express.<br />3.- Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.  It will modify the epigenome of cancer cells by de methylating histones and allow genes to express as normal, or at least making cells more susceptible to chemotherapy.<br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.- Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the        epigenome.</p><p>Because the epigenome is hereditable to daughter cells but changes in epigenetic marks will not come back.<br /></p>2.- Define what is meant by a sensitive period. <p>Sensitive periods are periods where epigenome can be widely affected.</p>        <br />3.- Identify sensitive periods of development. In girls at the time where ovocytes are been created, and in boys at aound age 9 when sperm genesis cells are been developed.         <br />4.- Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable. This can trigger an epigenetic disruption in all cells and as well that disruption could be pass to future generations.<br />    </div>
