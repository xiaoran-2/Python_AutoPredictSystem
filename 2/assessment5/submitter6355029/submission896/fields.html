    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands silence gene expression by creating a repressive chromatin structure and/or by forbiding transcription factor binding that leads to gene expression disruption.<br />DNA methylation is disrupted in cancer because of a locus specific DNA hypermethylation affecting tumor suppressor genes and because of a genome-wide DNA hypomethylation at repetitive regions CpG poor promoters and ICRs related with oncogenes.<br />DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands can lead to silencing of tumor suppressor genes. DNA hypermethylation at CpG island is often observed in tumours because it DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and epimutations (like hypermethylation) are rapidly selected through abnormally, rapidly, dividing cells lineages. <br />DNA methylation in repetitive elements serves as genomc integrity maintainer by silencing of repeats to prevent transposition or illegitimate recombination. Also it is suppsed to act as an genome defense agent preventing transposable elements. DNA mathylation in intergenic regions is also thought to maintain genomic integrity silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice cites.<br />In cancer, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elemnts is found to be genomic-wide hypomethylated, occurs in all tumour types tested and progresses with tumorigenicity. <br />This abnormality in methylation leads to genomic instability associated with illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats, transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neughbouring genes by genetic deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations. Genomic instability related with DNA hypomethylation is related with oncogens activation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation pattern of the paternal allele allows the expression of lgf2. This is because methylation of H19 gene occurring silence CTCF, that insulates lgf2 from downstream enhancers. In the maternal allele, H19 gene is not methylated and its expression leads to CTCF recruitment. CTCF is an insulator protein that isolets lgf2 from downstream enhancers. lgf2, therefore, is repressend in the maternal allele. <br /><br />As DNA hypermethylation of ICRs occurs in cancer cells, H19 ICRs gene in the maternal allele is also methylated so there will be a double lgf2 expresion, from paternal and maternal allele. lgf2 overexpression leads to Wilm's tumour, because is an growth promoting gene. This DNA methylation alteration is common, early observed in pre-neoplastic tissue. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an DNA-demethylating agent (DNMT<em>i</em>). As a DNMTi, Decitabine irreversibly binds DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA. Once binded, Decitabine inhibits irreversibly DNMTs actions and methylation epigenetic marks of that cancer call are not mitotically inhereted. Therefore, Decitabine have an anti-tumour effect preventing epigenetic marks abnormalities being inherited through cancer cell lineages present in tumours. It is such a kind of epigenome resetting.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epimutations are reversible, unlike mutations. It means that we can target DNA methylation-related epimutations to achieve restoring, enduring effects on cancer-related epigenomes. However, treating epigenetic machinery has inespecific actions in all the tissues, canceroginc or not. That constitutes a problem because epigenetic drugs are going to develop side effects. Although our primary aim, as clinicians, is the patient survival, side effects could be criticall for some sensitive periods. An epigenetic sensitive period is means a temporary strip where altered environments or certain agents (as cancer drugs) can have an effect on epigenetic control. And even more, once time the sensitive period is finished, the alterations can remain on the epigenome for the rest of the life. There are two major sensitive periods in the epigenome: early embrionic stages (before blastocyst formation) and germ cells production stages. Both epigenetic repprograming periods. <br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because epigenetic drugs could critically alter the special epigenetic machinery occurring during sensitive periods. Such alterations could lead to embrionic development disruptions or infertility by germ cells alterations. Therefore, pregnant and younger patients should be avoided for epigenetic cancer treatments. </div>
