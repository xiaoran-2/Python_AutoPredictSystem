    <div class="field-value">CpG islands (CGI) are present at the promoter site of certain genes, for instance genes that regulate the cell cycle (such as oncogenes). In a normal cell, theses CGI are methylated and hence epigenetically silence the gene and maintain the "closed" state of the corresponding heterochromatin. In a cancerous cell, this methylation is reversed and hence disrupted such that sites that were originally silenced through CGI methylation become unmethylated and achieve an active and open euchromatic state. Genes corresponding to these unmethylated CGIs are now open to expression. In cases where CGIs corresponding to oncogenes have been unmethylated, the oncogenes are expressed and result in uncontrolled cell proliferation thereby leading to the formation of a tumour. <br /><br />Along with CGIs, intergenetic regions (introns) and repetitive elements are also methylated. Methylation of introns ensures that genes properly expressed such that only the exons are expressed and introns are repressed. Expression of introns may lead to an aberrantly expressed sequence leading to an aberrantly/ non functioning gene and product. <br /><br />Repetitive elements within a sequence are prone to translocation owing to their repetitive nature. matching repetitive elements may form "loop" structures, or even translocate or "jump" to regions further away that match their sequence. Both these events lead to the silencing of that particular region of the DNA. Translocation of repetitive elements is particularly deleterious if the translocation happens to occur within a gene whose translation is required for normal cell functioning.  <br /><br />In a normal cell, these repetitive elements are methylated and hence silenced preventing them from forming loop structures and also from translocating. Hence normal functioning of these DNA regions may take place. In a cancerous cell however, the methylation marks are removed leaving the DNA exposed to aberrations such as those explained in the previous paragraph.<br /> <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">  The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted such that the paternally imprinted cluster is methylated while the maternally inherited cluster is not. The methylation mark on the paternal cluster is on the ICR as well as the H19 region. The unmethylated ICR on the maternal cluster is bound by a protein CTCF (which is an insulator). This prevents binding of downstream enhancers on the Igf2 gene (located upstream of ICR) and hence prevents expression on maternal Igf2. Since the ICR on the paternal cluster is methylated, CTCF does not bind it leaving the enhancers free to bind the Igf2 gene and allow its expression. Igf2 is an oncogene. Hence disruption of imprinting leading a lack of silencing of Igf2 on the maternal cluster results in expression of this gene from both maternal and paternal clusters which when combined with repression of the tumour suppressor gene Cdkn1c may lead and contribute to cancer due to over-expression of the oncogene Igf2 and the under-expression of tumour-suppressor Cdkn1c. Up regulation of the oncogene Igf2 along with lack of tumour suppressor expression also predisposes one to embryonic or childhood tumours (not adult tumours) such as the Wilm's tumour in the kidney. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> In a normal cell, pro-tumerogenic genes such as oncogenes are hyper-methylated by DNA methyltransferases in order to silence them, anti-tumerogenic genes such as tumour-suppressor genes are hypo-methylated. The presence and absence of methyl marks on the respective genes ensures that a normal cell cycle takes place.  However, in cancerous cells the presence and absence of methyl marks is reversed such that tumour-suppressor genes are now hyper-methylated and oncogenes are hypo-methylated. This results in the uncontrolled proliferation of the affected cells which in turn results in tumour formation. <br /><br />Decitabine is a hypo-methylating agent which acts by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases. <br /><br />Upon the addition of the hypo-methylating agent Decitabine, in cancerous cells, the hyper-methylation on tumour-suppressor is removed (the drug does not affect the already hypo-methylated oncogenes). Decitabine induced hypo-methylation of tumour-suppressor genes activates them hence ensuring the anti-tumerogenic activity of tumour-suppressors. The active oncogenes may be tackled using other methods. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Once epigenetic marks are laid during "sensitive" periods i.e. early embryonic development and germ cell productions, the marks are maintained throughout the life of the cell and are also transferred scrupulously to the exact same locations in the daughter cells where again the maintenance and transfer process is repeated. DNA methylation is one such epigenetic mark that helps to silence gene expression in most cases. <br />Sensitive periods, as mentioned above, are periods in development where epigenetic marks are at first removed and then added de novo. This occurs whenever the cell needs to change its lineage, such as during early embryonic development (blastocyst stage) or function, such as during germ cell development. <br />When tumorous cells are treated with epigenetic drugs during these "non-sensitive periods" the change can last for the lifetime of the cell and even transferred to its daughter cells since no new epigenetic marks are being laid down. <br />Since during sensitive periods epigenetic changes are taking place in cells, such that marks are being removed and new marks are being added, treating patients during these periods will be of no avail since any changes caused by the drug will be over-ruled by the inherent epigenetic machinery. </div>
