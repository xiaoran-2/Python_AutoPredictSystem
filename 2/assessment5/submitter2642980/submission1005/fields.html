    <div class="field-value">In healthy cells, CpG islands are mostly protected from methylation. However, some CpG islands are methylated between cell types, leading to silencing of gene expression. In cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated than in normal cells, normally at the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. CpG island hypermethylation can lead to the silencing of tumour suppressor genes, and in most tumours is more frequent than genetic mutations. This allows the cells to divide more rapidly than other cells and grow into a tumour. As the cancer progresses, there is increased methylation of CpG islands associated with tumour suppressor genes. Some examples of genes that are hypermethylated in cancers are BRCA1 in breast cancer, MGMT in gliomas and colorectal tumours, and RB in retinoblastoma. CpG island shores (about 2kb regions on either side of the island) are also often hypermethylated in cancer. <br /><br />In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to protect the genome from transposable elements. In cancer, there is genome-wide hypomethylation in these regions, which progresses with tumorigenecity. It is most common at repeats, leading to illegitimate recombination between repeats. Alignment between repeats and having open chromatin due to hypoethylation can lead to recombination. The repeats can also be activated, make copies of themselves and jump around the genome, potentially destroying coding regions of genes and activating neighboring genes and cryptic promoters. All of this contributes to genomic instability, which is an enabling characteristic of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprinted control region (ICR) is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele (paternally imprinted).  H19, a long non-coding RNA, is produced from the maternal allele. CTCF, a protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers, binds to the unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele. These enhancers are therefore free to act on H19 instead of Igf2, enhancing H19 expression. CTCF does not bind to the methylated ICR on the paternal allele, allowing the enhancers to promote the expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele. Methylation of the ICR spreads to the H19 promoter, silencing its expression. Therefore, H19 is normally expressed only from the maternal allele and Igf2 only from the paternal allele. In Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, there are two paternal-like alleles and loss of maternal-like allele: the ICR is methylated in both alleles. This leads to the the overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth promoting oncogene. Its overexpression can therefore lead to predisposition to childhood tumours, such as Wilm's tumour, which grows in the kidney. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, i.e. it demethylates DNA. It has an anti-tumour effect because it decreases hypermethylation at CpG islands and thus inhibits the silencing of tumour suppressor genes. In particular it is used for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia  and myelodysplastic syndromes.<br /><br />sources: Kantarjian et al.: Decitabine improves patient outcomes in myelodysplastic syndromes: results of a phase III randomized study (2006)<br />Malik and Cashen: Decitabine in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia in elderly patients (2014)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation has an enduring effect because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. However, global treatments like this may have adverse effects, especially during sensitive periods, that is, periods or epigenetic reprogramming. Epigenetic marks have to be cleared between generations to restore totipotency. During development there are two phases of reprogramming: one during pre-implantation development of the early embryo and the other during primordial germ cell development. It would be inadvisable to treat pregnant women because this could interfere with the development of the embryo.</div>
