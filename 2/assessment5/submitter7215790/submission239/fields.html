    <h1>Submission 239 from Anon (session_user_id: 35b447622962de444e0adee40b2ce61ff8e03b43)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an enzymatic epigenetic regulator, an inhibitor of so-called de-novo methyltransferases (DNMTs) and works - as a nucleoside analogue and after incorporation into DNA - via binding irreversibly to DNMTs, hence inhibiting their function of laying down DNA methylation. Due to incorporating into DNA, this class of drugs is dependent on replication and has as such the most impact on methylation pattern in highly-replicating cells such as cancer cells, where it causes demethylation. Due to the described mechanism, this however is unspecific. While its exact anti-tumour effect is still unknown, one can imagine that it may work against one of the hallmark features of cancer cells - especially those of haemtological malignancies - i.e. hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene promotors. Decitabine (trade name: Dacogen, manufacturer: Eisai, Japan) has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in one group of such haematological malignancies, i.e. myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-value">Methylation of DNA happens by adding a methyl group to the carbon atom at position 5 of cytosine, which is one of the four essential DNA bases. Regions of DNA where cytosine (C) follows guanine (G) in a linear way on the same strand (C-G) as opposed to their pairing in the DNA double strand (C=G) are termed CpG sites (short-termed for C-phophate-G). Regions with high abundancy of such CpG sites are called CpG islands. Such CpG islands appear frequently in gene promotors that regulate expression of the gene. While methylated promotor regions are generally associated with decreased gene expression, CpG islands within promotor regions are practically little methylated in normal cells. In contrast, cancer cells display relative hypermethylation also within these promotor CpG islands in comparison to normal cells, resulting in gene silencing. If this occurs e.g. in so-called tumor suppressor genes, this may be associated with increased risk of cancer. Examples for these would be<i> BRCA1</i> in breast cancer or <i>RB</i> in retinoblastoma. As this happens to differ between certain cancers in a locus-specific way or with regard to whole sets of genes, this can be of diagnostic use. <br />Other than CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements (satellite repeats, short or long interspersed elements - SINEs or LINEs, respectively) are usually methylated in normal cells. In cancer cells however, such DNA regions are relatively hypomethylated. If this relative hypomethylation occurs in oncogene promotor regions, this may lead to their enhanced expression and increased risk of cancer. Furthermore, there is an increased chance of DNA transcription from alternative start points or alternative splicing, thus elevated transcription noise. Relative hypomethylation of intergenic regions or repetitive elements may further be associated with altered chromatin compartmentalization in the nucleus and general genomic instability due to the increased risk of non-homologous crossing over.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Any alteration in methylation patterns of imprinted regions, i.e. any disturbance in monoallelic, parent-of-origin-specific gene expression can result in decreased expression of growth-restricting genes or in increased expression of growth-promoting genes. Depending on the gene looked at, loss of imprinting can happen by either hyper- or hypomethylation of imprint control regions (ICRs) leading to silencing or expression of both the maternal and paternal allele. <br />Loss of imprinting in the H19/Igf2 cluster serves as an example, as it is associated with nephroblastoma in children (Wilm's tumour). In normal cells, the maternal allele displays no methylation of the ICR, leading to binding of the insulator CTCF to the ICR, resulting in expression of H19 due to the action of downstream enhancers and no gf2 expression due to the insulating effect of CTCF. In contrast to this, the paternal allele displays methylation of the ICR, such that CTCF cannot bind and insulate the Igf2 promotor from the effect of downstream enhancers, resulting in expression of growth-promoting Igf2. In the specific case of Wilm's tumour, loss of imprinting leads to methylation of the ICR on both the maternal and the paternal allele, thus resulting in Igf2 expression in both alleles in a doubled dose. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alteration of DNA methylation patterns may have a lasting impact on the epigenome because this epigenetic regulation works in an replication-dependent way and as such is heritable. This means that any change of methylation pattern is passed on to the next generations of cells during cell division. Hence, after the effect is established it will last in following cell generations until epigenetic marks can be reset during certain periods of development. Such periods occur before implantation of the embryo and during germ cell development . Because of the fact that specific epigenetic marks need to be erased (e.g. X-inactivation during pre-implantation of the fertilized egg)  and others to be newly established (e.g. epigenetic imprints during gametogenesis) these periods are therefore termed sensitive periods as they are susecptible to any exposures that may interfere with these actions, e.g. by drugs acting upon DNA methylation pattern. This is especially true for drugs that work an unspecific way such as azacitidine or decitabine, which work by irreversibly inorporating into DNA as nucleoside analogues in a stochastic manner. Although such drugs seem to be sustainably effective in low doses with decreased risk for side effects, their use would be currently imprudent during such sensitive periods.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
