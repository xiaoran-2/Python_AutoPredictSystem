    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During the transition from normal to malignant tissues a progression of locus
specific hypermethylation and genome-wide hypomethylation can be observed. In normal
tissues the CpG islands in the promoter regions are not methylated, that
ensures the expression of the genes. However in cancer cells the CpG islands
and CpG island shores are hypermethylated that prevents the expression of tumor
suppressor and other genes. Notable examples of hypermethylation in the
promoter region are BRCA1 gene in breast cancer, MLH1 gene in colorectal
cancer, RB gene in retinoblastoma. The CpG island hypermethyaltion is often
more frequent than genetic mutations. The CpG island epimutations are
reversible and used as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of
tumors.</p>

<p>In contrast to the CpG islands, the intergenic CpG dinucleotides in
normal tissues are cytosine-5 methylated. This epigenetic modification prevents
the expression of repetitive elements and proto-oncogenes. Upon development
from normal to malignant tissues, the level of intergenic CpG methylation
decreases. The genome-wide hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic intervals
can cause transposition of mobile elements and rearrangements that can enhance
the tumorogenesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster is an example for imprinted region in the human
genome. The cluster consists of the Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) gene,
imprinting control region (ICR), H19 long non-coding RNA and enhancers. In
normal cells, the paternal allele of the cluster is methylated at the ICR and
H19 regions that prevent the binding of the insulator protein CTCF. In the
absence of CTCF the downstream enhancers assess the Igf2 and activate it. On
the other hand there is no expression of Ifg2 from the maternal allele, because
the ICR is not methylated and the CTCF is bind on it. The insulator prevents
the access of the enhancer to the Igf2 and the gene is silenced. However the
enhancers can access and activate the nearby upstream locus H19 at the maternal
allele, which promoter is not methylated. Therefore in normal cells the H19
lncRNA is expressed from the maternal allele and the Igf2 gene from the
paternal allele. In Wilm’s tumor cells there is loss of imprinting and the ICR
is hypermethylated. That blocks the binding of CTCF on both alleles and causes
overexpression of the growth promoting Igf2 gene.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor that belongs to the class of
DNA-demethylating agents. Chemically, decitabine is a cytidine analog and it
hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. The drug functions in a
similar manner to azacitidine, although decitabine can only be incorporated
into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA
chains. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursor of acute
myelogenous leukemia.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA
methylation in the genome is one of the epigenetic aberrations seen in cancer.
This epimutation is associated with either locus specific DNA hypermethylation
or genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. These epigenetic changes are passed on
during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells therefore they can
have enduring effects on the epigenome. However upon environmental factors like
diet, chemical exposure or drugs the epimutations can be actively erased. Once
erased, they do not return. It might be therefore that epigenetic therapies can
effect changes, which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all the
cells. </p>

<p>The periods
of establishments of epigenetic marks (reprogramming) are defined as sensitive.
During the development there are two waves of reprogramming – the
pre-implantation period (early embryonic development) and the primordial germ
cell development. Active remodeling of epigenetic marks can also occur during initiation
and progression of disease, when the somatic cells are reprogrammed. </p>
