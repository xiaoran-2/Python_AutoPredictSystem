    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands, which
are regions with high percentage of GC, tend to be in the promoter of genes,
where they are usually unmethylated, allowing the expression of genes (their
methylation tigger the silencing of gene expression). Some CpG islands are
methylated in some cells but not in others allowing the expression of some
genes in some type of cells only. Methylation of CpG islands allow, as well, the
inactivation of one X chromosome in mammal females.</p>

<p>In cancer,
methylation at CpG islands located in the promoter of tumor suppressor
genes becomes more dense (we also have
hypermethylation of the regions surrounding these CpG islands called CpG
shores), giving to cells the
advantage to divide more rapidly or not die. As cancer progresses,
there is an increase on methylation of these CpG islands.</p><p>At the same time there is an accumulation of epigenetically silencing
marks in histones.</p>

<p>On the other
hand, in general, in a normal cell, CpG are methylated in the repetitive
elements, in the intergenic regions and in the introns of genes, allowing their
heterochromatinization and thus the maintenance of genomic stability. But in
cancer these regions are hypomethylated (the hypomethylation progresses with
time) allowing that they misalign and recombine (because they are not packaged
down into heterochromatin). This illegitimate recombination may produce the
loss of chromosomes, gain of chromosomes or other mutations. Moreover, because
of the hypomethylation, the repeats can adquire the ability to make a copy of
themselves and transpose. And this can result in the disruption of the coding
region of a gene, it may activate neighboring genes or it may produce
delections or insertions.</p>

<p>So, in cancer alterations in DNA methylation cause an <span>uncontrolled
cell growth</span> and produce genomic instability and mutations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, cells show loss of imprinting so that some genes (lots of
them are growth promoting or growth suppressing genes) no longer show a monoallelic
parent-of-origin-specific expression but they become either expressed from both
parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles. In the case of the
H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region is unmethylated on the maternal
allele. That’s why CTCF binds its insulator element. It means that the
enhancers will act on H19 (this gene will be expressed) but Igf2 will be
silent. On the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated and
CTCF can’t bind the insulator element. Then, the enhancers can act on IGF2 but
H19 will be silent.</p>

<span>Nevertheless, if there is
loss of imprinting, you can see hypermethylation of the imprint control region
on the maternal allele as well, so that there is expression of Igf2 on both
alleles. Then, we have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to what we saw in a
normal cell. Igf2 act as a growth promoting and this double dose is associated
with Wilm's tumour. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is
used as a drug to treat cancer by removing the methyl groups attached to
histones by some damaged proteins. These damaged proteins add to histones more
methyl groups than usual, causing the silencing of the genes they surround,
including tumour suppressor genes so that the uncontrolled cell growth that
causes cancer happens. Therefore, Decitabine prevent the uncontrolled cell
growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that
last beyond the period of treatment because epigenetic changes are passed on to subsequent cell generations, so they are mitotically heritable. This means
that the changes are maintained. </p>

<p>I would avoid treating patients with such drugs
during the sensitive periods (during germ cell development and during early
development), which are periods when changes in the environment have a big effect
in epigenetic reprogramming, because the treatments in these periods could affect
and alter the epigenome. Alterations in DNA methylation during these periods
may produce diseases or disorders.</p></div>
