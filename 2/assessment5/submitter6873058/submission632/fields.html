    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands (promoters) are hypomethylated
while the introns, intergenic regions, and repetitive elements in the genome
are hypermethylated. These epigenetic marks are laid down to demarcate biological
functions: allowing normal expression of genes associated with the CpG islands;
inhibition of expression of repeats and aberrant expression of
proximal genes due to associated cryptic promoters.  Anomalies in the epigenetic signatures occur
in cancer cells: global hypomethylation of repeats, intragenic regions, and
introns; and locus specific hypermethylation of CpG islands (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908412001927#" title="Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908412001927#">Hassler et al, 2012</a>). Global hypomethylation could result to
transcriptional activation of normally silent regions (eg. oncogenes,
transposons, imprinted genes) which could result to genomic instability
(promotes insertions, deletions, illegitimate recombination), abnormal transcriptome, and ultimately tumorigenesis; and abnormal nuclear organization due disrupted
chromosomal structure (eg. pericentromeric regions) resulting to aneuploidy and
illegitimate recombination. Genes associated with hypomethylation in cancer
cells are usually involved in growth and developmental regulation (eg.
imprinted genes), wherein misregulation could have consequences of cell hyperplasia
and invasion. The locus specific hypermethylation of CpG islands could result
to (point) mutations, allelic loss, and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.
These events could culminate to tumor genesis and eventually cancer
progression (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.25482/pdf" title="Link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.25482/pdf">Daniel et al, 2011</a>).</p>

<p>These aberrant methylation landscapes are brought about by
genetic mutations in the DNMTs (loss or gain of function), which laid down
incorrect epigenetic marks probably early events on neoplastic tissues. Also, impaired
DNA demethylation machinery (TET proteins) is recently being linked to cancer
development as its proper function is involved in the maintenance of normal DNA
methylation status (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897214/pdf/nihms443973.pdf">Yang et al, 2012</a>; <a href="http://genomebiology.com/content/pdf/gb-2012-13-10-173.pdf">Song et al, 2012</a>).  These anomalies have
substantial repercussions, since DNA methylation status is associated with other
epigenetic elements: reading-out of aberrant DNA methylation marks with
subsequent overlaying of wrong epigenetic signatures will ultimately locked
down the cancer epigenome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Most of imprinted genes (eg. <i>H19/Igf2</i> locus) are involved in growth and development and are regulated by imprint control regions (ICR) which are marked
by differential methylation. The maternally-expressed <i>H19</i> and paternally
expressed <i>Igf2</i> share common enhancer and the uniparental expression of the
imprinted genes is regulated by CTCF binding to the ICR: employing insulator
mechanism. The ICR on the maternal allele is usually unmethylated, allowing binding of CTCF. This interaction prevents looping of the enhancers to
the <i>Igf2</i>, thus allowing the enhancers to act on <i>H19</i> and activate expression. However, ICR on the paternal allele is methylated which prevents binding of CTCF to the ICR. In conjunction with <em>H19
</em>promoter methylation, these would allow interaction of enhancer with <i>Igf2</i> and promote
its expression (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3314145/pdf/nihms343596.pdf" title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3314145/pdf/nihms343596.pdf">Abramowitz et al, 2012</a>). Expression of<i> H19/Igf2</i> locus is deregulated in Wilms’
tumor: the ICR in maternal allele is also hypermethylated. This consequentially
allows the enhancer to access<i> Igf2 </i>on both alleles and promote its
expression in a biallelic fashion (paternal uniparental disomy). Lack of <i>H19</i>
expression could result to cell overgrowth (or cancer) since<i> H19</i> was found to
be a tumor suppressor <i>in vivo</i> (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2527926/pdf/zpq12417.pdf">Yoshimizu
et al, 2008</a>).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the epigenetic drugs that inhibits
DNMTs. These nucleoside analogs (at a particular dose) get incorporated in to the genome during DNA
replication of actively proliferating cancer cells. These
inhibit DNA methylation by binding the DNMTs onto the DNA, concurrently
declining the concentration of free DNMT enzymes resulting to heritable demethylated DNA. As a consequence, hypomethylation occurs on succeeding cell division and follows activation of tumor suppressor genes that were previously silenced
in cancer cells and could ensue restriction of the tumor growth. Since this drugs gets included in the DNA, concerns are raising as to the long term adverse effects of the drug that have not yet surfaced. Since these drugs target cells that proliferate rapidly like cancer cells, it should have "acceptable risks" for the considerably slow-dividing normal cells (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2802667/pdf/bgp220.pdf" title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2802667/pdf/bgp220.pdf">Sharma et al, 2010</a>).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNMT inhibiting
drugs ensue heritable hypomethylation to the next generations of cancer cells,
this might have long-term effects. This drug-induced epigenetic modification
confers susceptibility of treated cancer cells to other chemotherapeutic agents
without necessarily killing it, but stops the progression. Concomitantly, these
drug-induced epigenetic modifications could also happen to other tissues, and
its effects could surface on the future, or even next generations (if gametes
were affected, or the embryo for pregnant women). Administration of drugs
should consider the condition of the patient, particularly on aspects of
sensitivity of the epigenetic machinery to environmental cues (sensitive
periods): the early embryonic development (for pregnant women), and
primordial germ cell development. Clearing
of epigenetic marks and resetting of appropriate epigenetic profiles occur on
these sensitive periods. Treatment with epigenetic therapy during these periods
could adversely affect epigenetic machinery and inappropriate reprogramming of
epigenetic signatures could commence which could result to another cancer, or
imprinting disorders if aberrations took place on the gametes. Affecting the
germ cells could have a transgenerational inheritance of the abnormal
epigenome. Epigenetic therapy at these sensitive periods is inadvisable. </p></div>
