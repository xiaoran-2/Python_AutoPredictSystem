    <h1>Submission 207 from Anon (session_user_id: b7a8b0602874ee17a18ecc847ba9e9f333125aef)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine  belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents.</p><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside and when incorporated into the DNA it will inhibit  methyltransferases resulting in demethylation and thus effectively in hypomethylation.</p><p>CpG Island hypermethylation can be associated with silencing of tumor suppresor genes. By demethylation of these hypermethylated regions this silencing can be overcome. Thus decatibine might be a useful agent in those instances where hypermethylation is involved in the occurrence of cancer</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cellsmethylation of CpG islands is generally associated with silencing of genes.</p><p>In cancer cells it is often seen that CpG islands are hypermethylated. </p><p>This can contribute to cancer when  this occurs near tumour suppressor genes. As the expression of these genes (that would normally impair cancer formation) will now be silenced,and will favor / enhance tumour formation.  </p><p>In normal cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements will be methylated. Therebye preventing transposition of these repeats and the activation of cryptic promoters present within  the intergenic region.</p><p>In cancer cells these regions can get hypomethylated. This can result in genomic instability. This genomic instability can arise by the activation of cryptic promoters and thus the disruption of gene expression of genes present in that area. By the activation and transposition of repetitive elements (transposons) And moreover, removal of methylation can promote recombination between repeats which can result in chromosomal rearrangments such as deletions, insertions and translocations. </p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer as it can result in overexpression of genes promoting growth (oncogenes) or in downregulation of tumour suppressor genes / growth restricting genes.</p><p>Within the <strong>paternal </strong>allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster the imprint control region (ICR) is normally methylated therebye <strong>preventing </strong>the binding of CTCF. Subsequently enhancers  <strong>can't</strong>  bind to promote H19 expression. <strong>Instead Igf2 will be expressed</strong>.</p><p>Within  the<strong> maternal allele </strong>of this cluster the ICR is normally <strong>not methylated</strong>.Thus CTCF can bind to this region and enhancers can act to <strong>promote H19 expression</strong>. These enhancers can't affect Igf2 and this will not be expressed. So normally the paternal Igf2 allele will be expressed and the maternal Igf2 allele won't.</p><p>In Wilms tumour both maternal and paternal ICR will be (hyper)methylated. This will result in expression of both the maternal and paternal Igf2 and thus in overexpression of Igf2.</p><p>As Igf2 is involved in promoting growth (insuline like growth factor) overexpression of this protein will result in excessive growth which is on of the characteristics of cancer. </p><p><br /></p><p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration of methylation state can have enduring effects when these drugs are applied to cells that will not undergo any epigenetic reprogramming, Or in other words cells that have an etsablished/ fixed epigenetic state. This means either cells that are fully developed / differentiated or cells that won't replicate,(are in G1 phase). Changing the methylation status in these cells will have a long lasting effect. Thus, these drugs should not be used during sensitive periods.</p><p>A sensitive period is a period in development where epigenetic reprogramming occurs. Sensitive periods are primordial germ cell development and during early embryonic development.</p><p>Treating during sensitive periods can disrupt the normal epigenetic reprogramming and might result in loss of imprinting / genome wide hypomethylation and thus the cure could be worse than the disease. </p><p><br /></p><br /></div>
