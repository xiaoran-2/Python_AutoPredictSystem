    <h1>Submission 1061 from Anon (session_user_id: c7c09990b2af7e760ff2610a3c97f36e3a940138)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span> <span>Epigenetic changes are
passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they
are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might
therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer
growing without having to kill all its cells. Changes in DNA methylation is an epigenetic change that is passed on. Methylation alteration can either suppress genes(hypermethylation) or activate them(hypo- or no methylation). Usages
of antimetabolite drugs during certain periods such as sensitive periods have the
ability to change the nature of methylation in the individual. A sensitive
period is where the epigenetic marks are being destroyed and re-established.
These periods occur during the development of pre implantation embryo in blastocyst and primordial
germ cell development of the implanted embryo. Hence, treating patients such as
pregnant women and even nursing mothers(since the drug may mix with breast milk and impair kid's growth) with decatibaine would be highly inadvisable. </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor, used to treat myelodisplastic
syndrome. It is a hypo methylating agent preventing methylation of suppressor
genes that regulate growth and division. <span>Decitabine's anticancer effects are
believed to be twofold.  One way that it
works is by de methylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By this process of de methylation, normal
function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over
cell growth. It is also a member of the antimetabolite class of drugs since it
produces a cytotoxic effect.</span> <span>When the cells incorporate these substances into the
cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to
produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer
cells.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 contains a
differentially methylated region that is also an imprinting control region.
 Usually, the paternal copy of H19 is
methylated and silent while the maternal copy is hypo methylated or un methylated
and expressed in the offspring cell. Methylation of the H19 promoter is
negatively correlated with H19 expression. When Igf2 is expressed in
paternal copy while it is silenced in maternal copy. It is bound by a protein
called CTCF, an insulator protein. When it's insulating IGF2 the enhancers
act on H19 and enhancing its expression on the maternal allele. On the paternal
allele when this imprint control region is methylated CTCF can now no longer
bind. <span>If CTCF isn't
binding and there is no insulator action then these enhancers are act on Igf2 and
promote Igf2's expression from the paternal allele. Igf2 is expressed only from
the paternal allele and not the maternal allele. The reason that H19 is not active
on the paternal allele is because of heterochromatin spreading.  Igf2 promotes growth; it's an oncogene. So when the maternal copy
also expresses Igf2 due to hyper methylation of ICR , the risk of Wilm’s tumor
increases.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpGs clustered into CpG islands are commonly found near the promoters of gene sequences. DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with
genomic imprinting, X inactivation and suppression of repetitive elements. It involves binding by MeCP proteins that have a transcription repressive domain and condense the chromatin(by inducing other factors), thus altering the expression of other genes. However in cancer, the CpG islands are hypermethylated. These
hypermethylations occur specifically at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes;
CpG island methylations are associated with silencing of underlying genes,thus helping
the tumor to grow further.The silencing leads to a kind of phenomenon called CIMP,
first found in colorectal cancers.</span> <span>Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive
sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such
as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA. These regions are usually methylated to protect the sequences from damage. But in the case of cancer, these regions are hypomethylated  we see genome wide hypomethylation in this case. Hypomethylation of repeatslead to illegitimate recombination between repeats, their activation (also that of transpositions), and activating cryptic promoters.These disrupt the neighbouring gene.Then, there is also the hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters. The factors that target tumor suppressors are activated due to hypomethylation. All the above conditions lead to genomic instability, that leads to cancer.</span></p></div>
