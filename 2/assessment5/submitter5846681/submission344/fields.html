    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to establish genomic stability.<br />When the DNA methylation at CpG islands is disrupted, this stability is lost, and oncogenes express themselves.<br />In a normal cell, the CpG islands are not methylated, while methylation is seen in the repetitive elements and intergenic regions, even in the introns of the genes themselves.  Loss of DNA methylation in ICR imprint control regions is commonly seen in cancer.<br />DNA methylation is an inactive epigenetic mark.  Methylation of DNA is essential for life because cells that lack DNMT1 and therefore lack methylation do not survive and die in the embryonic stage.  Although DNA methylation is mutagenic, it is retained because it confers certain benefits such as protecting the genome from transposable elements.  In cancer, the intergenic regions and repeats are hypomethylated, leading to genomic instability, and the normally unmethylated CpG islands become hypermethylated, and this hypermethylation is a poor prognosis for MSD.  Over a period of time, as more methylation occurs, the normal cells change through hyperplasia and neoplasia to the cancerous or metaplastic state.  While DNA methylation maintains genomic stability, hypo- or hypermethylation both lead to genomic instability which is the hallmark of cancer characterized by insertions, deletions and translocations of the chromosomes.  In hypomethylation, as seen in poor CpG promoters, the underlying genes are expressed, such as R-RAS in gastric cancer.  In hypermethylation of repeats and intergenic regions, which may affect singe genes, or groups of genes, or even CIMP (CpGI methylator phenotype), there is genomic instability characteristic of cancer.  Single genes cancers include RB (retinoblastoma), BRCA1 (breast cancer), and MGMT and MLHi (colorectal).  These single genes can also be used as markers to disinguish cancerous from normal cells.<b></b></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprinted control region ICR is methylated in the paternal allele but unmethylated in the maternal allele.  In the maternal allele,  an insulator protein CTLF binds to the unmethylated ICR and insulates the Igf2 upstream, and the enhancers downstream enhance the RNA H19.  In the paternal allele, the methylation of the ICR prevents the CTLF from binding and insulating Igf2, leaving the Igf2 exposed as it were and prone to "attack" (i.e., enhanced) by the downstream enhancers.  The Igf2 is thus enhanced and expressed only in the male allele.  Furthermore, in the male allele, due to the downward spreading of DNA methylation from the ICR, the encroaching methylation represses and silences the H19 promoter.  Igf2 is an oncogene that promotes growth.   Loss of imprinting is a hallmark of cancer, and follows repeated insults over time on the DNA methylation.  Because of loss of imprinting following expression of the paternal igf2 by enhancers, the maternal igf2 also is expressed resulting in a double dose of growth-promoting igf2, as seen in the rare case of paternal disomy where the cell inherits a double dose of the paternal allele.  This imprinting error results in the childhood cancer called Wilm's tumor that affects the kidney.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, one of only four epigenetic drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of cancer, acts by demethylating DNA and therefore belongs to the class of drugs called DNMTI or DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor. It is effective against MSD and myelogenous leukemia.  The myc gene encodes a transcription factoir that is involved in the DNA regulatory system.  Disruption of this pathway is the main cause of cancer.  Shutting own the myc gene slows the proliferation of myeloma cells.  An epigenetic drug like Decitabine somehow affects the tumor cells in some way and renders them more amenable to treatment by conventional anticancer drugs.  Epigenetic therapy of cancer causes changes in the epigenome that are passed during cell division from generation to generation until they are erased completely; thus, such therapy does not have to eliminate all the cancerous cells outright, and can have an enduring effect on the epigenome.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A sensitive period in epigenetics refers to the time when changes in the environment have the greatest effect while epigenetic reprogramming is taking place.  The two sensitive periods in human ontogeny are (1) during early embryonic development; (2) during germ cell development. The resulting epigenetic changes have to be mitotically inheritable so that they will not end once the cells diivide but passed on down from generation to generation. Treating patents during the sensitive period is not a good choice because drugs that target the epigenetic machinery may do untold damage to the developing germ cels of patients of reproductive age.<br />The DNA methylation can be altered by weakening the strong C-C bond between the methyl group and the 5th. carbon of cytosine by an hydroxylase, and the hydroxyl group can then be demethylated.  This demethylation occurs twice during epigenetic reprogramming in early development, first at the preimplantation period of early development, and second during primordial germ cell development. This "remodelling" of the epigenome is to provide a "clean slate" as it were by removing the imprinted gene in which either the maternal or the paternal allele alone is expressed.  The DNA is then remethylated to restore genomic stability.</div>
