    <div class="field-value"><p>​DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the
DNA, this happens at cytosines. It occurs almost exclusively at Cs that
are followed by Gs. These dinucleotides are symmetrical
and this allows them to be maintained through cell
division. Methylation doesn't tend to occur at CpG islands but when
it happens it means (almost always) silencing of
gene expression. Therefore, DNA methylation is an
inactive epigenetic mark. DNA methylation is by far the most common
epigenetic mistake. Hypermethylation is locus specific, also hypomethylation
occurs but it happens genome-wide.</p><p>In a normal cell CPG islands are hypomethylated, the
genome in general is methylated in their repetitive elements through the
intergenic regions and indeed and even in the introns. In contrast, in cancer
the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated and the rest of the genome in
general (including the repetitive elements in the intergenic elements) are
hypomethylated. CGI hypermethylation is found in the promoters of tumor
suppressor genes. The fact that DNA methylation is mitotically heritable
assures success in the continuity of this mechanism in cancer. According to the
Knudson hypothesis this is one of the events that must occurr so that the
cancer can appear. So basically this happens through DNA methylation and
consequent epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes.</p><p><span>Hypermethylation
can also occur in the CPG island shores (2Kb neighbouring CPG islands).<b> </b>For
instance the intracisternal A-particles are spread throughout the genome and
they're in very </span>high copy.
It is preferred that thsee repeats stay silenced because they can be
detrimental when active causing illegitimate combinations between chromosomes.
Also alterations in ICR (hypo or hypermethylation) can cause loss of imprinting
which can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or
overexpression of these growth promoting genes as it happens in the Wilm’s
tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting basically consist of monoallelic expression, even when DNA methylation is synonymous with silencing this doesn't always happens with ICR's. The Igf2 cluster (on human chromosome 11) is controlled by enhancer blocking. </p><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated on the maternal allele, and
methylated on the paternal allele, and this means that its expression is <b>paternally imprinted</b>. There’s a long noncoding RNA called H19. It's produced just from the maternal allele. When
this ICR is unmethylated as a maternal allele, it’s bound by a protein called
CTCF (insulator protein). So that it’s able to insulate CTCF's binding insulate
Igf2. Because it's insulating IGF2 these enhancers get free to act on H19 and enhance
its expression on the maternal allele. However, when CTCF blocks this by its binding,
the enhancers loop to H19, to enhance H19 expression. On the paternal allele
when this ICR is methylated, CTCF can no longer bind and if this happens there
is no insulator action, thus these enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and
promote Igf2's expression from the paternal allele.</p>

<p>In
cancer, there's a loss of imprinting with hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal
allele. Thus, there’s a double dose of Igf2 (Wilm's tumour). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent and it's used as the treatment for myelodisplastic syndromes. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltrasnsferases. <i>De novo</i> methyltransferases recognize something in the DNA that allows them to newly methylate cytosines. These are expressed mainly in early embryo development and they set up the pattern of methylation. They are named DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B. Decitabine <span>reverses the classic epigenetic alteration, DNA promoter methylation. It acts by removing inhibitory methyl groups from the cytosine residues of promoter sequences, which presumably restores downstream gene transcription.</span><br /><br />Sources: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine" title="Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine</a> and <a href="http://www.healio.com/hematology-oncology/genitourinary-cancer/news/online/%7B65ee3f45-256e-4f5c-a0d4-f21ea999704a%7D/decitabine-had-antitumoral-effect-on-adrenocortical-carcinoma" title="Link: http://www.healio.com/hematology-oncology/genitourinary-cancer/news/online/%7B65ee3f45-256e-4f5c-a0d4-f21ea999704a%7D/decitabine-had-antitumoral-effect-on-adrenocortical-carcinoma">http://www.healio.com/hematology-oncology/genitourinary-cancer/news/online/%7B65ee3f45-256e-4f5c-a0d4-f21ea999704a%7D/decitabine-had-antitumoral-effect-on-adrenocortical-carcinoma</a><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A prerequisite for understanding the function of DNA
methylation is knowledge of its distribution in the genome and given
that DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, it is in fact a strong mechanism
of continuity.
</p>

<p>There are sensitive periods when the environment may be able
to influence the epigenetic makeup. So it's not necessarily true that altered environment
at any stage of development could actually determine a
different epigenetic outcome, this same principle applies to drug therapy. </p>

<p>The periods that are sensitive to epigenetic control are (1) the period from the primordial germ cell
development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperm, (2) Pre-implantation period and early
post-implantation.</p>

<p>Both are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome. It
seems that at these times there’s a lot going on in terms of removal and laying
down epigenetic marks at different places in the genome but in general in the
genome as a whole. The use of a
drug throughout these periods can definitely have a major impact on the DNA
methylation patterns which can be passed to the following 2 generations, thus it makes sense to avoid using drugs during these periods.  </p></div>
