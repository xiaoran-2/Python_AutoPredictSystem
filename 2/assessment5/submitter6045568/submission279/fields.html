    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells  CpG islands are not methylated, allowing the expression of adjacent genes, for instance, tumor supressor genes. <br />In cancer cells CpG islands are methylated. This fact leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes in the cancer which prevent tumor growth. If tumor suppressor genes are silenced, malignant cells grow out of control<br />In the normal cell, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated, which helps to maintain the integrity of the genome, avoiding transposition, interference in transcription, etc.<br />In cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not methylated, which causes genomic instability such as, deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertion, leading to an abnormal karyotype.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the normal cell, in the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, H19 is silenced, so the enhancers activated Igf2 transcription. In the maternal allele of the normal cell, ICR is unmethylated, CTCF binds to the enhancer, H19 is transcripted and Igf2 is silenced. In the normal cell, the transcription of Igf2 occurs only in the paternal allele.<br />In Wilm´s tumor there is a hypermethylation of ICR in the maternal allele, and Igf2 is expressed as is in the paternal allele. The transcription of Igf2 occurs in the paternal allele and in the maternal allele, so Igf2 is overexpressed.  This overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth promoter, contributes to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor (DNMTi), a hypomethylating agent. DNMT (DNA methyltransferase) is an enzyme that methylates DNA. Decitabine binds in an irreversible way to DNMT as they attach to DNA, avoiding DNA methylation. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation during replication. This drug avoids hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes that is produced in cancer, allowing the expression of these genes, and preventing malignant cells to growth. This drug is used in myelodysplastic syndrome.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes in the DNA
methylation pattern, induced by these DNMTi drugs, can be passed to the
daughter cells by replication, the hypomethylated DNA remains in the daughter
and granddaughter cells, because it is an epigenetic change that can be
inherited. That is the reason why these drugs have effects that last beyond the
period of drug treatment.<span><br /> It
is necessary to avoid using these drugs during the sensitive period, which is a
period of epigenetic reprogramming, when epigenetic marks are setting. These
sensitive periods are: early development, from fertilized egg to blastocyst,
and primordial germ cell development in the embryo during mid-gestation. The use of drugs
that inhibit DNA methylation, acting on normal and cancer cells because they have a non-specific mechanism of action, disrupt normal epigenetic
reprogramming resulting in erroneous epigenetic marks that would have long term
consequences in normal cells due to an altered epigenetic programming.</span></div>
