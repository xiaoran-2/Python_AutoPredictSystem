    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression.  Specifically, CpG islands can be found in promoter regions whose aim is to suppress tumor expression. Per lecture ( 7-3) , "DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation to silence tumor suppresser genes in cancer.  In cancer,  a switch occurs which causes methylation to switch from its typical level at CpG islands,  it becomes hypermethylated, thus silencing the tumor suppressors regions.  Silencing of this function leads to increased tumor growth through replication within cells, thus leading to increased growth of epigenetic alterations .  <br /><br />Changes in methylation can produce changes in the intergenic and repetitive functioning areas of a region.  In fact, normal methylation can become switched when cancer is present int hess two areas.  For other words,  methylation alterations in cancer regions will assume the opposite methylation behavior than that seen in its "normal" sister cell area.  Working with hypermethylated CpG islands , they will send signals that increase the epigenetic alterations seen in cancer. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele pattern is for H19 and CTCF ( imprinting region) to be methylated. This combination allows for paternal lgf2 ( growth promoter) to be activated by the RNA enchanters, during a normal imprinting sequence.  On the other hand, the maternal allele has the opposite combination.  It is not methylated on H19 or CTCF; however CTCF does have an insulator protein protecting it from the RNA enchanter.  <br /><br />As has been previously stated, lgf2 is growth promoting. Per lecture 4-3, disruptions in the parental imprinting alleles are a specific feature of cancer. For example, in Wilm's tumor,  the hypermethylation in the imprinted region of the maternal allele combined with the methylation on the paternal allele causes both parental lgf2 regions to be activated.  This is an epigenetic condition found in Wilm's tumor, a childhood kidney cancer. <br /><br /> It should be noted however that hypomethylation during the imprinting sequence can also produce cancer, as well.  A loss or addition of methylation within the alleles can lead to increased epigenetic alterations.  This leads to increased chances for tumor growth which is a primary factor in the the development of cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Currently a variety of drugs are either currently being researched or have been introduced into the treatment of cancer. These drugs primary purpose are aimed at epigenetic control.   Decitabine is one drug that is currently on the marketplace whose aim is to de-methylate DNA in "myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia" ( Economist) .  This drug is focused on targeting the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, specifically aimed at DMNT.  This drug is used to bind the nucleotide of a daughter cell so when it goes to replicate the methyltansferase is bond and cannot replicate the methylation process.  This limits the amount of cell division a cancerous cell can achieve over a period of time.  <br /><span><br /><br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Per lecture 8-4, long term research studies have not been completed in targeting the potential long lasting effects of epigenetic drugs used in cancer treatment.    We currently do know that the introduction of some drugs have initiated negative genetic changes.  For example, smoking and alcohol are two known drugs that can impact genetic structure. Specific "sensitive periods" in an individual's  growth occurs during the pre-conception ( lecture 6-5) and primodrial germ stage in early development.  These specific stages are where the genetic re-programming of an individual occurs. It is during the gamete and germ stage where markers are being changed and the laid back down. Past research has specifically marked these stages as being especially problematic for disturbance through environmental factors as seen in studies related to smoking and alcohol consumption. Therefore, the  introduction of cancer focused drugs during these specific times, could have not only immediate effects but generate long term effects for an individual.  It is also not apparent if the effects would translate into heritable changes that could have the potential to be passed down through generations. </div>
