    <div class="field-value">Whereas a high proportion of CpGs are methylated within normal cells, a much lower proportion are methylated within CpG islands.  Because methylation is usually inversely correlated with gene transcription and CpG islands are often found within promoter regions, this relative lack of methylation in the islands may ensure that more genes remain active than would be the case with a more uniform methylation of all CpGs.  In cancer cells, CpG islands are, in contrast to normal cells, hypermethylated. This may lead to the silencing of genes, such as tumour suppressors, leading to cancer cell proliferation.  CpGs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are usually methylated, tending to reduce their level of transcription.  In the case of the repetitive elements, this also increases the chances of their being in a region of heterochromatin and this, in turn, reduces the likelihood of aberrant recombination that is otherwise a necessary risk with repetitive DNA.  In cancer cells, by contrast, CpGs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. Through the resulting conversion of heterochromatin to euchromatin, this gives rise to chromosomal instability, and this, in turn, enhances mutablity, with an increased incidence of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer through a resulting imbalance of growth controlling factors.  In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, a binding site for an Insulator, CTFC, is unmethylated in the maternal allele and methylated in the paternal allele in normal cells.  Only the unmethylated, maternal allele can bind CTFC and this binding has the effect of preventing Enhancers from also binding to this site. This, in turn, leads to the expression of Igf2 from the paternal, but not from the maternal, allele.  Igf2 is a growth promoter and oncogene. When imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted so as to deprive the cell of a functional maternal allele, this leads to an abnormally high expression of Igf2. This is manifested in Beckewith-Wiedemann Syndrome, which has a number of characteristics resulting from abnormally high levels of Igf2, including an increased predisposition to Wilm's tumour, a childhood cancer of the kidneys.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, acting through inhibiting DNA Methyltransferases.  As a consequence, the level of CpG methylation is lower in cells treated with Decitabine than in untreated cells.  Cancer cells have hypermethylated CpG islands and, as these are often found in promoter regions, this has the effect of reducing the transcription of certain gene, such as tumour suppressors in cancer cells. Decitabine reduces this hypermethylation, thereby increasing the activity of such genes, resulting in an anti-tumour effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because methylation patterns are usually mitotically heritable, passing on any such effects to subsequent generations.  A sensitive period is one in which the cell is being epigenetically reprogrammed and is therefore unusually sensitive to environmental challenges. Although it is likely that cell-type specific sensitive periods arise throughout the lifetime of an organism, there are two organism-wide sensitive periods, during the development of the germ cells and at pre-implantation of the embryo.  Treating patients in ways that cause epigenetic changes during these sensitive periods - during pregnancy and during childhood - runs the risk of causing more widespread changes than during other periods, which is inadvisable because of the risk of harmful side-effects.</div>
