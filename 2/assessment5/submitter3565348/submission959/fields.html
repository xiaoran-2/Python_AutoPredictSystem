    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation happens when enzymes called DNA methyltransferases add a methyl group to cytosine by in regions of DNA with many CpG sites. These sites are called CpG islands, and tend to be promoter regions. The methylation of these regions turns genes off.  In many cancers, genes that are normally expressed might be silenced by hypermethylation at CpG islands. If the gene is a tumor suppressor, the usual detection of runaway growth is prevented, and cells can multiply out of control. <br /><br />DNA methylation normally helps maintain genetic stability by preventing expression of the many repeated sequences found between genes. Some of these repetitive elements can jump - copy themselves - to other areas on the same or nearby chromosomes. In cancers, if these repeats are indeed expressed, unwanted combinations of chromosomes or overexpression of growth genes may occur. The cell may gain more and more genetic mutations, leading to more serious cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation of the Imprint Control Region is one way epigenetics and imprinting interact. The IGF2 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 2) gene on chromosome 11 affects growth and development of many kinds of cells of the embryo. Expression of IGF2 is controlled by the downstream H19 Imprint Control Region. Normally, because of paternal imprinting, only the copy of IGF2 inherited from the father is expressed because the H19 Imprint Control Regions are methylated, which disables them. This allows enhancers downstream of them to activate IGF2 The copy of IGF2  from the mother is repressed because the H19 Imprint Control Region from her copy has the CTCF protein bound to it, which disables the downstream enhancers. <br /><br />If maternal imprinting is lost, both copies of IGF2 will be expressed, leading to abnormal increased growth of kidney cells in many cases of Wilm's tumor. This happens because of abnormal methylation of the ICR and in the Differently Methylated Region of H19, which allows the downstream enhancers to activate IGF2, just like in the paternal copy. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a type of DNMTi (DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor). DNMTi's are irreversibly bound after they are incorporated within DNA, and will be passed to daughter cells. In cancers where hypermethylation silences tumor suppressors, DNMTi's can reverse this effect in existing and daughter cells by preventing the DNA Methytransferase enzymes from transferring methyl groups to parts of the genome such as CpGs. This both slows the growth of existing mutated cells, and prevents additional mutations caused by hypermethylation.<br /><br />Decitibane is currently approved in the U.S. for MDS (Myelodysplastic Syndromes) and AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) and similar leukemias. These blood syndromes and leukemias primarily affect older patients. Since older people are less concerned with long term side effects of a drug that prevents methylation in a wide variety of cells, and since these patients are typically in the most serious stages of cancer, Decitabine is both effective and well tolerated. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation is one way epigenetic heritability is established. Since epigenetics is defined by the mitotic heritability of a phenotype without an underlying genetic change, changes to DNA methylation can both undo existing epigenetic changes, as well as establish new epigenetic expressions by activating or silencing genes which are promoters or inhibitors of some part of the phenotype.<br /><br />There are 2 periods when epigenetic changes can be erased and reestablished, and these are considered to be the 2 sensitive periods. The first happens shortly after the egg is fertilized, when epigenetic marks are cleared from the cells by passive demethylation, and then reestablished in the epiblast stage. Later in gestation, when PGCs (Primordial Germ Cells) develop, epigenetic marks are again cleared and then reestablished in the gametes. Environmental changes, such as chemical exposure, nutrition changes, or stress can affect these marks. <br /><br />Treatment such as drugs, radiation, or nutritional changes may have long lasting, undesired effects during the first sensitive period which will affect all subsequent daughter somatic cells. Treatment during PGC development may even affect offspring. </div>
