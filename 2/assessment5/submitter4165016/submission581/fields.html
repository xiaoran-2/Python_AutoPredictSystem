    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are regions of densely grouped CpG motifs situated at genes' promoters. They are usually unmethylated, and related with gene expression. The methylation grade tend to increase not only with time's progress, but also in abnormal situations such as cancer, where they become hypermethylated. This hypermethylation leads to a downregulation of that gene's expression. These genes tend to be tumor suppressor genes, so, the lack of expression turns into a mayor incidence of cancer as the genes involved in controlling proliferation are not being expressed.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually found in a methylated state, related with an heterochromatic conformation and silencing, all of which leads to genomic stability. In cancer, these are found in an hypomethylated state, leading to genomic instability and activation of oncogenes. It may occur that the repeats recombinates illegitimate, that transposons and cryptic promoters become activated and neighbouring cells end up disrupted.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting is the responsible for genes being expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. It is an epigenetic phenomenon that ensures that only one of the parental alleles will be expressed. Imprinted alleles are then silenced. <br />The imprinted gene expression is controlled by the imprinted control regions (ICRs). In the case of the Igf2 gene, a growth-promoting oncogene encoding the insulin-like growth factor II, its expression is under the control of a group of enhancer proteins. <br />The ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated, which allows the binding of CTCF, a particular insulator protein, to occur. CTCF insulates Igf2 gene from the downstream enhancers, silencing its expression and enhances H19 expression, as the enhancers remain free to act on the secondary-preferred loop. <br />The ICR on the paternal allele is methylated, impeding CTCF binding and allowing enhancers to act directly on Igf2, determining its expression. <br /><br />The upregulation of Igf2 in Wilms' tumour due to the loss of imprinting of the maternal allele could be related to mutations or deletions, uniparental disomy or epigenetic disruption.<br />A disrupted imprinting due to hypermethylation of the maternal allele leads to a double dose of Igf2 and this constitutes an early event in tumorigenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is  a DNA-demethylating agent that, as it name shows, it reduces the level of DNA methylation along the genome. It is a cytidine analog that acts to inhibit DNA methyltransferases.<br /><br />The anti-tumour effect can be understood as hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG shores is a hallmark of cancer, and generating a hypomethylated condition would have a therapeutic effect. The usually hypermethylated promoters are those of tumour suppressor genes; genes involved in controlling cell divison and growth. Once demethylated by decitabine, their normal function is restored.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is heritable; it can be passed through generations, and also its alterations, many of which are selected in diseases such as cancer. <br />Those alterations can occur spontaneously or be induced by environmental factors. Particularly, there exist some sensitive periods on which theses alterations are more prone to occur and environmental changes will have the biggest effects.<br />There are defined sensitive periods during development: the early development and the primordial germ cell development periods, in which there is an active reprogramming of the epigenome. Every modification in the epigenome occuring during this periods have the potential to be transmitted. <br />Epigenetic alterations are reversible, that is why therapy has been aimed to reverse those modifications. A therapeutic treatment targeting epigenetic modifiers should be avoided during these periods as it may end up having more negative consequences than positive ones.</div>
