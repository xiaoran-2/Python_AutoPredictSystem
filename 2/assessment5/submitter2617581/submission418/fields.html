    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In a normal cell, CpG islands are
hypomethylated because they are clustered in gene promoters, which are
expressed in this particular cell. In a normal cell, the genome in general is
methylated in their repetitive elements, through the intergenic regions to get
them packaged in tightened chromatine, structure that inhibits illegitimate recombination or expression of transposons.<br />
In a cancer cell, CpG islands are more likely hypermethylated especially in the
promoter of suppressor tumor genes; so the tumor suppressor gene is locking
down in a silent inactivate state. The rest of genome in general
is hypomethylated, so repetitive elements are able to recombination or
transposition elsewhere in the genome, promoting genome instability, gaining
oncogene gene activation or repressing tumor suppressor gene expression for example.<br /></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> There is a loss of imprinting in cancer cells:
the cancer cell no longer shows the monoallelic parent-of-origin specific
expression. Alteration in DNA methylation of imprinting control region can
result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or over expression of
growth promoting genes. <br /><p><span>
The imprint control region (ICR) is methylated in the paternal allele: DNA
methylation at ICR blocks the binding of CTCF, so enhancers can access Igf2 gene to
activate its expression.<br />
The ICR is unmethylated in the maternal allele, the binding of CTCF insulates
Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers (down-expression of Igf2)<br />
There is hypermethylation of the maternal allele at the H19/igf2 cluster in
Wilm's tumour, it drives in an over expressed Igf2, the maternal allele of
H19/Igf2 cluster behaves like paternal allele, so the result is growth
promotion and cancer.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to new drugs acting on
epigenetic abnormal marks of cancer cells, this epigenetic drug is FDA-approved
in trials to treat myelodysplastic syndrome.<br /><p>
It's a nucleotide analog and it's a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor: it gets incorporated into the DNA upon
replication and bound irreversibly the DNMT1. This drug is replication dependent and it's not selective for the cancer cells, but the overgrowing (by "over replication") cancer cells
contain more decitabine and have less free DNMT1; the hypermethylation of CpG
islands in cancer cells might not be maintained and the repression of growth
cell again might be effective. <br /></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation and some
histone modifications are mitotically heritable, so using epigenetic therapies
can modify a cancer cell epigenome, the daughter cells and grand daughter
cells inheritate the same changes on their epigenome.</p>

<p>The sensitive period of development for epigenic
modification are 2 stages: in primordial germ cell line and in preimplantation
cells (after fertilization). So in a child, epigenetic drugs could modify
primordial germ cell line and get some long-term consequences (but the risk
could be the same with chemotherapy used in child malignancies); epigenetic
drugs could also change only one cell, promoting cancer years later. So, the
consequences could be for the individual (increased risk of cancer 20 or 30 years
later in adulthood) and for its descendants (lethality, malformation, cancer).<br /></p>
