    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are clusters of CpG dinucleotides that occur throughout the genome,
often near the promoters of genes.  Most
CpG islands near gene promoters are hypomethylated, which allows for normal expression of genes.  Methylation
of CpG islands near promoters is strongly associated with gene silencing.</p><p>Most CpG islands are hypermethylated in cancer cells.</p><p>
Hypermethylation of CpG islands can lead
to cancer by silencing cancer-protective genes, such as tumor suppressor genes.  The
normal role of tumor suppressor genes is to limit cell divisions.  Silencing these cancer-protective genes by
hypermethylation of CpG islands allows tumor cells to divide out of control and
for tumors to grow.</p><p>
CpGs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated in
normal cells.  DNA methylation in
interegenic regions is thought to contribute to genomic stability.  This means that chromosomes are less likely
to break and rejoin abnormally when intergenic regions are heavily methylated.  Methylation in intergenic regions is also
thought to silence “cryptic” promoters that would otherwise interfere with
normal gene expression.  DNA methylation
at repetitive elements confers genomic stability by preventing both
transposition and illegitimate recombination. 
This kind of DNA methylation also silences strong promoters associated with
some repetitive elements, allowing for more normal gene expression.</p><p>
Intergenic regions and repetitive elements show hypomethylation in cancer cells
compared to normal cells.</p>
Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is thought to
contribute to cancer by bringing about genomic
instability and by allowing for activation of oncogenes.  Genomic instability includes both transposition and rearrangements by illegitimate recombination.  In both cases, cancer-protective genes can be destroyed by such rearrangements and cancer-promoting genes can be activated by being brought closer to a strong promoter.  Hypomethylation of DNA in intergenic regions
can also allow abnormal expression of an oncogene that promotes tumor growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally the imprint control region is hypermethylated on the paternal
allele.  Hypermethylation blocks binding
of an insulator protein called CTCF. 
Without binding of the insulator, paternal Igf2 is subject to the action
of two strong enhancers and is active.</p>

<p>Conversely, the ICR on the maternal allele is normally hypomethylated, allowing
CTCF to bind and protecting maternal Igf2 from the enhancers and shutting down
expression of Igf2 from this allele.</p>

<p>The maternal H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated in the ICR in Wilm’s tumor so that it behaves in the same way as the paternal allele..</p>

Methylation of the maternal ICR causes the maternal allele to be expressed at the same level as the paternal allele.  The product of the Igf2 gene promotes cell
division, causing such cells to divide more rapidly than normal, which is a
hallmark of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.</p>

<p>Decitabine promotes DNA demethylation throughout the genome in a DNA replication-dependent manner.</p>

Some tumors are induced by hypermethylation and silencing of promoters in
tumor-suppressor genes.  Treatment with
an optimal dose of decitabine could lead to reducing methylation of the
promoter and allowing the cancer-protective tumor suppressor to be expressed in
the tumor cells, leading to death of tumor cells or at least a reduced rate of tumor
growth.  Since the action of decitabine depends on DNA replication, rapidly dividing cells (including cancer) are more sensitive than other cells that don't divide as rapidly.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation patterns can be inherited during cell division so that once DNA
methylation marks are applied within a cell (usually early in development), the
marks can be maintained in the cell and in all of the descendants of the cell,
potentially throughout the lifetime of a person.</span></p>

<p><span>A sensitive period is a time in the animal life cycle when epigenetic marks are
being established or removed and when developing organisms are most sensitive to treatments that modulate the epigenetic machinery.</span></p>

<p><span>The major sensitive periods in mammals are during the formation of gametes,
when many epigenetic marks are erased, and during early
embryonic development, when epigenetic marks are being reapplied during cell
differentiation.  However, sensitivity can also extend into early childhood. </span></p>

<span>It would be inadvisable to apply such treatments just before and
during pregnancy and during early childhood. 
Treatments during pregnancy might interfere with the establishment of
normal epigenetic marks during cell differentiation in the embryo, which could
affect the health of the offspring thoughout its life.  Treatments during gamete formation could interfere with epigenetic reprogramming. 
This could cause the offspring to produce gametes that have abnormal and
harmful epigenetic marks that could produce poor health in their future
offspring.</span></div>
