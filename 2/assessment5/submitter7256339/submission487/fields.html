    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>CpG islands are <strong>unmethylated</strong> in normal cells. 60% of all promoters mainly Tumor supressor genes have CpG islands. The Hypomethylated state of the CpG contributes towards the transcription of Tumor supressor proteins and other essential proteins thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis.</li><li>In Cancer cells, CpG islands are<strong> hyper-methylated</strong>. Hypermethylation causes inactivation of transcription and eventually the loss of production of essential proteins.</li><li><strong>Hyper-methylation of CpG islands of tumor supressor genes can fail the synthesis of Tumor supressor proteins.</strong> These proteins can no longer regulate the cell and repair damage hence paving way for cancer. In several cases of cancer, hypermethylation of TSG is the prime cause, for instance<em>: <strong>Hyper-methylation of Rb T</strong></em><em><strong>SG causes Retinoblastoma, MLH1 TSG causes lynch syndrome, BRCA1 TSG causes breast cancer</strong></em><em><strong>.</strong></em></li><li>Intergenic regions and repetitive regions are<strong> hyper methylated under normal conditions</strong>, they are hence inactive and transcription of obsolete or unnecessary proteins.</li><li>In <strong>Cancer cells, the Intergenic and repetitive regions are hypo-methylated</strong>. Activation of these regions will contribute to <strong>genomic instability</strong>, Mouse models with the deletion of Dnmt1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) died prematurely due to epigenetic malfunction.</li><li> The hypomethylation of  Intergenic and repetitive regions will lead to <strong>illegitimate recombination</strong> between repeats, <strong>Chromosomal abherrations</strong> can occur such as deletion, translocation, insertion, Certain types of<strong> cryptic promoters will be activated</strong> such as the agouti yellow allele, Axin fused allele.</li></ol></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>The Imprint control region<strong> (ICR) of the Paternal allele is methylated</strong> and inactived hence CTCF does not bind to ICR expression this results in the production of a large amount of enhancers.The transcribed enhancers bind IGF2 promotor and <strong>expression of IGF2 is high.</strong></li><li>The  Imprint control region <strong>(ICR) of the Maternal allele is unmethylated</strong>, CTCF can now bind to ICR and lead to the expression of H19 protein. The Enhancers have a high affinity to H19 promotor than IGF2 promotor this leads to a <strong>low IGF2 expression.</strong></li><li>In the case of<strong> Wilm's tumor</strong> (Child hood kidney tumor disease), the<strong> maternal allele inherited is methylated at the ICR region</strong>.The allele now behaves like the paternal version and produces increased amount of IGF2 which leads to this disease.</li><li>In Wilm's tumor H19 gene is inactivated and IGF2 is excessively produced.With the loss of H19 protein the ability to repress over expression of IGF2.<strong> IGF2 is a growth factor hormone that plays a critical role during fetal development. Cancer cells are known for their tendency to divide incessantly: they need a large supply of growth hormones and signalling molecules. The abundance of IGF2 in these cells will incline the normal cell to become cancer cells.</strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H19_(gene)" title="Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H19_(gene)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H19_(gene)</a> <br /></li></ol></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>Decitabine belongs to a<strong> class of DNMTi (DNA methyl transferase) inhibitors</strong>, it is FDA approved for the treatment against <span>myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine" title="Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine</a> </span></li><li> Decitabine exhibits <strong>hypo-methylating properties</strong>. It has the ability to incorporate itself into the DNA of replicating cells. DNMT mistakes Decitabine for cytidine and is irreversibly bound to decitabine. Now, that methylating agents are stuck and have lost activity, hypo methylation within the genome occurs.</li><li>As per the study conducted by Dr.Baylin, Decitabine shows good penetrative effects against solid tumors and also a possible transgenerational influence over the epigenetics of tumor. In tumor, most of the tumor supressor gene (TSG) would have lost activity due to hyper methylation of it's promoters. The <strong>hypomethylating nature of Decitabine can resume the promoter activity and enable transcription of TSG and curb the growth of tumor cells</strong>.</li></ol></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>Although there is no hardcore evidence, Epigenetics are hereditary by nature and they survive reprogramming of the genome effectively. DNA methylation being the most fundamental epigenetic modification can have a <strong>transgenerational effect on the epigenome</strong>.</li><li>Sensitive period is defined as the<strong> time period where epigenetic reprogramming takes place</strong> and the individual is maximum susceptible to modification.</li><li>The sensitive periods of human development is <strong>during the early stages of embryo implantation and primordial germ cell development.</strong></li><li>There is an inevitable<strong> risk of damaging the germ line of the patient</strong> when treated during sensitive periods. This can lead to irreversible transgenerational aftermath of genetic diseases for the future generations of that individual.</li></ol></div>
