    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation of CpG islands is the formation of repressive chromatin structures resulting in gene silencing by condensing chromatin.Methylated islands are bound by CpG binding proteins MeCP1 and 2 which have their own transcriptional repressive domain.<br />MeCP1 and 2 also recruit other protein partners that help in condensing the chromatin at these loci.<br /><br />DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted by methylation at normally unmethylated  CpG island loci . Usually <br />silencing  promotors of tumor suppressor genes. <br /><br />Tumor suppressor genes silenced no longer slow cell division,repair DNA mistakes,and mediate programmed apoptosis which often occurs as the result of DNA errors or mutations .The resultant cell lines are selected for over normal cells .They have higher ,uncontrolled  replication rates, propagate DNA mutations and mistakes and don't undergo apoptosis.<br /><br />Normal DNA methylation at intergenic sites silences cryptic splice sites.<br />At repeats DNA methylation silences repeats. <br /><br /> <br /><br />DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repeats is disrupted by a genome wide hypomethylation. This is one of the first effects of cancer on the genome.It progresses with increased tumorigenicity and is most common at the repeats.<br /><br />Hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repeats results in genetic instability characterized by  euchromatic configuration.<br />As a result  repeats are activated and are susceptible to illegitimate recombination of repeats between different chromosomes transposition between different chromosomes  ,chromosomal deletions and insertions at repeats and aberrant chromosomal duplication  .<br />Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes as well as within genes  occurs at intergenic regions...Activating repeats allows transcriptional interference from strong promoters.It prevents the mutation of repeats (MeC to T) by demethylating MeC  which when present , helps prevent transposition. <br /><br />This chromosomal instability driven by DNA demethylation appears to enhance tumorigenicity. Tumorigeniciy increases as demethylation proceeds. Increased tumorigenicity may be measured as a function of the amount of hypomethylation present.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Paternal allele methylation blocks CTCF insulator protein from binding to the ICR of the Igf2 gene .<br />spreading methylation to the H19 gene promoter  blocking it's access to nearby enhancers. This allows enhancers to access the Igf2 gene and it's resultant expression.<br /><br />Maternal allele methylation does not occur at the ICR to Igf2 allowing CTCF insulating protein to bind to it preventing local enhancers access to Igf2preventing it's expression.The enhancers target H19 instead and it is expressed .<br /><br />Wilm's tumor is the result of double paternal imprinting  doubling the expression of Igf2 .<br />This is compounded by  maternal unmethylated ICR Kcnq1 in the same gene cluster that codes  an antisense lncRNA <br />which blocks expression( recruits G9a and PRC2 that perform H3K9me and H3K27me silencing in cis)  of Cdkn1c a kinase growth inhibitor and cell cycle regulator .<br />Kcnq1 is normally methylated allowing Cdkn1c expression in the maternal allele.<br /><br />Cancer results from double expression of growth promoting oncogene Igf2 and double silencing of Cdkn1c kinase growth inhibitor/cell cycle regulator.<br />Increased oncogene expression,lacking apoptosis, lacking growth inhibition ,lacking tumor suppression and cell cycle regulation leads  to unfettered growth and uncontrolled replication and immortality giving this cell line a selective advantage leading to cancer.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-mehtyltransferase inhibitor.<br /><br />Decitabine inhibits aberrant epigenetically heritable propagation of DNA methylation at tumor suppressor gene promoters.<br />Incorporated into cellular DNA during replication and RNA during transcription as a citidine analogue .Inhibiting methyltransferase<br /> causing demethylation of the sequence  allowing cellular differentiation and apoptosis. Ref:(<a href="http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01262" title="Link: http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01262">http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01262</a>)<br /><br />Over time Decitabine restores  normal unmethylated status of tumor gene suppressor promoters. <br />Blocking the cancer induced methylation of these sites  carried forth (heritable) in future cell divisions<br />reactivating  tumor suppressor genes in these cell lines.Tumor suppressors regulate and slow cell division,repair DNA,<br />and mediate apoptosis. The advantage cancer cells have  when  controls are removed,affords them <br />uncontrolled cell division ,lack of DNA repair  proceeding unrecognized and uncorrected (normally a candidate for apoptosis)<br />and lack of programmed cell death ,giving these cell lines the advantage of immortality.<br />Removing these methylations restores normal functions in the cell lines affected ;an anti tumor effect.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation ; demethylating intergenic regions and repetitive  elements, methylating (silencing) tumor suppressor gene promoters <br />demethylating (activating normally silenced) oncogenes are all epigenetically heritable ,highly destabilizing,and can lead to aberrant<br />phenotypic expression of  the particular cell line.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a period in which epigenetic reprogramming is occurring.<br />Cells undergoing this process are highly susceptible to environmental factors that may prevent or change normal epigenetic controll<br />Abnormal phenotypes among the affected cell lines may result.<br /><br />Sensitive periods:Cancer cells divide more rapidly often as a result, their cells are more sensitive at this time to certain agents vs. normal cell lines.<br />In this course sensitive periods refer to early embryonic pre-implantation and primordial germ cell(mid gestation)  re-establishment/reprogramming   epigenetic marks.<br />Included : early childhood and puberty, periods of rapid growth and development(pubertal germ cell maturation i.e. further re-establishment of epigenetic marks ) .<br />The 2-3 month period prior to fertilization in females is also a sensitive period . The soon to be released ova are finalizing their epigentic marks.<br /><br />Treatment during sensitive periods with epigenetic modifying drugs risks altering the normal epigenetic marks being  re-established resulting in heritable genetic instability in normal cell lines predisposing them to dysfunctional phenotypes   including cancer. <br /><br /><br /></div>
