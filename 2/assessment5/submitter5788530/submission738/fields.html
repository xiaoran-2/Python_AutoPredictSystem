    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">Normally, CpG islands are generally hypomethylated, while other regions of the genome, particularly intergenic regions and repetitive elements, are generally methylated, and DNA methylation serves to maintain genomic stability. However, in cancer, there are drastic changes in DNA methylation function: DNA methylation at CpG islands becomes denser but the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This reciprocal cross in function of DNA methylation is a key observation made in the development of tumors, some of which can be malignant. Many CpG islands that are hypermethylated are found on the promoters of tumor suppressor genes (the "brakes" of cell replication), and CpG island (CGI) hypermethylation silences these tumor suppressor genes, allowing for uncontrolled cellular replication. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the CGI hypermethylation is locked down, permitting the daughter cancer cells to continue replicating uncontrollably. Additionally, intergenic regions and repetitive elements experience hypomethylation, leading to genetic misalignment and illegitimate recombination, increasing genomic instability, a factor that results in several forms of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">What is typically observed in the H19/Igf2 cluster in normal cells is that there is methylation on the paternal allele while the maternal allele is unmethylated. If an allele is unmethylated, just like the maternal allele, transcription factor protein complex CTCF is able to bind to its insulator element, promoting the H19 gene while silencing expression of Igf2, a growth promoter. Otherwise, Igf2 is expressed in the methylated paternal allele. This expression of genes in a parent-of-origin specific manner is called imprinting. However, imprinting can be disrupted; if genomic hypermethylation occurs as a tumor develops, the imprinting control regions (ICR) will experience hypermethylation as well. This means that the previously silenced Igf2 on the maternal allele will be reactivated, and both alleles will express Igf2. This disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is a characteristic associated with Wilm's tumor. Since Igf2 is a growth promoter, if both alleles express Igf2 instead of just one in imprinting, cell growth and replication will be accelerated to a faster than normal rate, thus contributing to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that belongs to the group of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA-demethylating agents.  As a result, the drug contributes to the hypomethylation of DNA, and the drug has been used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors to acute myelogenous leukemia. The DNA hypomethylation caused by the drug counteracts the hypermethylation experienced by CpG islands at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Therefore, Decitabine is linked to an anti-tumor effect by reactivating tumor suppressor genes previously silenced by hypermethylation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a type of epigenetic mark that is both stable and mitotically heritable; therefore, these marks are able to be passed on to future generations through DNA methylation's effects in the epigenome. This allows drugs that alter DNA methylation to only do so once and still have effects lasting beyond the treatment period. However, there do exist periods during which DNA methylation is reprogrammed and epigenetic marks are resetted, and these periods are called sensitive periods. These sensitive periods occur during two key points in development: gametogenesis, during which mature haploid gametes are formed, and after fertilization in order to ensure totipotency. What is achieved during the sensitive periods allows for normal development, fertilization, and cell differentiation. To treat a patient during these sensitive periods, which could be a woman who is pregnant or a member of a couple aiming to have a child, would disrupt reprogramming of DNA methylation and thus harm offspring development. Using epigenetic drugs can be efficient, but they must be used wisely by avoiding treatment during sensitive periods.<br /></div>
