    <div class="field-value"><span>In a normal cell the
majority of CpG islands in the promoters of genes are usually unmethylated and
allow for gene expression. Methylation at CpG islands invites specific
proteins, MeCP, to bind to the DNA (e.g. in X inactivation). These MeCP
simultaneously repress transcription while binding and also can recruit other
proteins that induce a condensed chromatin structure. These actions combine to
make densely packed DNA that is largely inaccessible to transcriptional
machinery and is essentially silenced for gene expression. In the context of
cancer, CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated and when this occurs
for a tumour suppressor gene then the locked-down silencing and resultant
non-expression is one factor that contributes to unrestricted growth of the
cancerous cell. In conjunction with CpG island hypermethylation is the hypomethylation
of intergenic regions. In normal cells these regions would be methylated in
order to silence cryptic promoters or splice sites that could initiate
transcriptional errors in neighbouring genes. In addition, repetitive elements
in the gene would normally be silenced through methylation as otherwise the
gene can transpose or ‘jump’ around the genome and cause illegitimate
recombinations, among other ill-effects.  In a cancer cell repeats are also hypomethylated.
Both intergenic regions and repetitive elements can affect genomic stability
when activated. So for a normal cell the CpG island is unmethylated while the intergenic
regions and repetitive elements are methylated to maintain genomic integrity,
while the inverse is true for a cancer cell. Genome-wide hypomethylation of
intergenic regions, repetitive elements, CpG-poor promoters and ICRs, and tumour
suppressor hypermethylation are well-established hallmarks of DNA methylation
contributions to cancer. These effects can combine to help produce a cell that
is resistant to apoptosis and quick to divide while containing many genomic
aberrations such as deletions, reciprocal translations and insertions, so
contributing to cancer development.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>For the H19/Igf2 cluster, when
the paternal allele is methylated at the imprint control region (ICR) this
methylation spreads downstream to the neighbouring H19 gene and silences it.
Additionally, an insulator protein CTCF is prevented from binding to the ICR by
the methyl groups. This combination of events permits enhancers downstream of the
H19 gene to access the Igf2 gene upstream of the ICR and induce expression. Thus
when the gene is paternally imprinted i.e. methylated at the ICR, Igf2 is
expressed. For the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated which allows
binding of CTCF. This blocks enhancers from preferentially accessing the Igf2
gene and a secondary path is taken whereby the enhancers act on an unmethylated
active H19 gene. H19 is a reservoir for microRNA and is not involved in
imprinting. So Igf2 is not expressed from a normal maternal gene. Loss of
imprinting is a common feature of cancer cells. In Wilm’s tumour the maternal
allele is aberrant and hypermethylated at the ICR (imprint disorder) so it behaves
like another paternal allele, leading to overexpression of Igf2. As Igf2 is a
growth promoter this contributes to overactive growth of the cells and the development
of a tumorous state.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a
replication-dependent DNA-demethylating agent approved by the U.S. FDA and indicated
for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. It is an analog that acts like
a nucleoside in the synthesis of DNA. On introduction to the cell the drug
molecule is incorporated into the cell DNA during normal replication. Methyltransferase(s)
specific to DNA (DNMT) then binds to the analog and instead of being released
it is bound irrevocably. This prevents the DNMT from further methylation of
more DNA. Thus the overall effect on the epigenome as cell replication proceeds is that the DNMT
content of the cell is taken up by more of the drug and methylation is reduced.
As tumour suppressor genes hypermethylated at CpG islands are silenced and so contribute
to uninhibited cell growth, the action of Decitabine in reducing DNA
methylation can suppress tumorigenesis in this context. There is an optimal anti-neoplastic
effect at pre-toxic doses.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA methylation is a
stable mitotically heritable trait that is passed from cell to daughter-cell
for generations through the recognition of maintenance DNA-methyltransferase
(DNMT1) for hemi-methylated DNA and the resultant establishment of epigenetic
marks following the prescribed pattern. Alterations to DNA methylation caused
by the action of a targeting drug can therefore have an effect on the genome
long after treatment has ended. There are two main periods in the cycle of
human development which are termed sensitive periods where the epigenetic marks
on the genome are reset and the cell is vulnerable to epigenetic changes due to
environmental influences, meaning drug treatment may be inadvisable. The first
is in early embryonic development when cells are reprogrammed from the specificity
needed for sperm/egg cell function to totipotency, enabling lineage-specific
cell development. The embryos of pregnant women may be affected adversely by
the drug with possibly fatal direct consequences for the foetus. The second is
that of primordial germ cell development where somatic cell marks are removed
and sperm/egg cell marks are laid down within the embryo from mid-gestation onwards
to childhood. The long term reproductive ability of embryos (when grown) and young
patients exposed to the drug may be affected.</span></div>
