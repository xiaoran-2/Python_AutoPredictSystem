    <h1>Submission 907 from Anon (session_user_id: 4f9b3bd51045ee3423a3ba62a6ec2d9b946dc296)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes; the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.  Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, in turn, restoring the function of tumour suppressor genes and control of cell growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell you see hypomethylated CpG islands, while in a cancer cell they are hypermethylated.  The disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to the silencing of tumour suppressor genes, leading to rapid selection of epimutations; tumour growth.  In a normal cell you see hypermethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements, while in a cancer cell they are hypomethylated.  The disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability due to copy errors.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele so the enhancers can act on Igf2, since CTCF is not binding to the insulator, the enhancers can act on Igf2; therefore Igf2 is expressed.  Normally the ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele, so CTCF will bind the insulator element, enhancers will act on H19, and Igf2 will be silent; therefore Igf2 is not expressed.  But in the case of Wilm's tumour, (instead of Igf2 being expressed on the paternal allele and H19 being expressed on the maternal allele), loss of imprinting will cause Igf2 to be expressed in both the paternal and maternal alleles; Igf2 (which is growth promoting) is doubly expressed (and H19 is silenced).<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, in other words, DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis.  A sensitive period is a window of time that extensive epigenetic reprogramming happens for, cell types usually during development and the establishing of their epigenetic marks, as well as early embryonic development &amp; germ cell development.  One example mentioned in class, is the brain's sensitivity period being infancy; when it is actively developing.  Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable as it can have downstream consequences such as an altered epigenome, which could lead to erroneous gene expression and phenotypes.<br /><br /></div>
