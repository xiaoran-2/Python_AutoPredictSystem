    <div class="field-value">One of the main benefits of DNA methylation is to maintain stability of the cells.<br />The DNA methylation at CpG islands is a mechanism to control gene expression. Methyl groups are added as epigenetic marks as cells differentiate into specific tissues, preventing cells from reverting to stem cells or converting into a different cell type. <br /><span>DNA methylation in repetitive elements (REs) is associated with the regulation of gene transcription, embryonic development, and differentiation.<br /></span>M<span>ethylation also plays a role in mediating gene expression for some genes.<br /></span>For CpG-rich promoters, methylation of these islands means silencing of their genes, which is very important in case of oncogenes or growth-promoting genes for example.<br />Many alterations of the methylation state of the cancer epigenome are observed in comparison to the epigenome of normal cells, and the methylation state contribution to cancer is context dependent.<span> <br />These disruptions include a genome-wide loss of methylation (Hypomethylation) in the intergenic regions of the genome.<br /></span>Hypomethylation of repeats and intergnic regions result in illegimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes, this also happens because hypomethylation turns heterochromatin into euchromatin.<br /><span>Another observed disruption is a regional gain of DNA methylation (Hypermethylation) in the CpG islands and also their shores up to 2 Kbp. <br />This abnormal methylation in cancer cells causes genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes. <br />In cancer, this disruption causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes which control the cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands. In other instances it causes the activation of oncogenes or growth promoting genes.<br />Also in cancer cells, the disrupted epigenetic state causes the expression and transcription of random, non-tissue-specific genes causing the cells to express abnormal functions.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 cluster includes an imprinted gene which is normally expressed on the paternal allele only and silenced on the maternal allele.<br />This is due to the ICR region in the cluster which is normally methylated on the paternal allele only, therefore causing this imprinted expression in which the H19 is silenced and the Igf2 is expressed due to the enhancers on the paternal allele.<br />While on the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated allowing the CTCF to bind an insulator element which causes the expression of the H19 gene due to the enhancers, while the Igf2 gene remains silenced.<br />This imprinted expression is disrupted in Wilm's tumour due to the hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele, which leads to the expression of Igf2 gene on the maternal allele also rather than staying silenced. Therefore the patient has a double dose or over-expression of this gene (Igf2) which is growth promoting associated with Wilm's tumour which is a kidney tumour in children.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is <span>an anti-cancer (antineoplastic or cytotoxic) chemotherapy drug. <br />It is classified as a</span> hypomethylating agent, because it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. (DNMTi - DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor).<br />As an DNMT inhibitor, Decitabine is nucleoside analogue, it gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then when the DNMT comes to bind it, it becomes bind irreversibly.<br />Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. It has <span>an anti-tumour effect in two ways:<br /></span>One is that by demethylating DNA, <span>normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.<br /></span>The other way is that Decitabine i<span>nteract with targets in the cell to produce a cytotoxic effect causing the death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.<br /></span>Decitabine is FDA approved.<br /><br />Additional reference:<br /><a href="http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx#.U57AuNIW1qU" title="Link: http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx#.U57AuNIW1qU">http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx#.U57AuNIW1qU</a> <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA epigenetic marks tend to be stably preserved throughout mitosis, which is the cell devision typical of ordinary tissue growth, therefore <span>altered DNA methylation marks can have enduring effects on the epigenome.<br />These epigenetics marks are preserved and inherited to daughter cells in mitosis devision by the DNMT1 enzyme.<br /></span><span>In contrast to germline development, there are somatic cell sensitive periods in which environmental signals produce epigenetic changes.<br /></span><span>The epigenome is most vulnerable to environmental changes during periods of extensive epigenetic reprogramming, such as early embryonic development.<br /></span>Also f<span>emale germ cells (oocytes) remain in a demethylated state until puberty, so environmental agents can still affect the epigenome during childhood.</span><span><br />Also the periods when the female is pregnant should be seen as a sensitive period because of the developing embryo that will be exposed to the chemotherapy.<br /></span>Therefore treating patients during these periods is inadvisable because the germ cells and embryonic cells are vulnerable to the environment and can get disrupted pathologically.</div>
