    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is usually very low, i.e. there is typically not much methylation at the CpG islands. In cancer, CpG islands are typically disrupted by becoming hyper-methylated in the cancer cells. This leads to the silencing of certain genes that would normally regulate cell growth, division, and function, and would normally suppress the cancer cells. <br />Generally there is more DNA methylation in the intergenic regions to help silence repeats and unneeded regions. In cancer all of this DNA methylation is typically reversed, and the hypermethylation that was initially present in the intergenic regions becomes hypomethylated and loses the methylation. This contributes to cancer because repeats that should be silenced are not leading to gene aberrations in the form of abnormal deletions, insertions, or reciprocal translocations that would normally not be present due to methylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation patterns in both the paternal and maternal alleles were hypermethylated in the H19 cluster, leading decreased Igf2 expression. The imprinting of this cluster is disrupted because the expression of Igf2 is eliminated and the imprinting is lost. This disruption leads to cancer because Igf2 helps to regulate cell growth, and when it is silenced the cell growth is no longer regulated.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor that is a DNA de-methylating agent to help remove the DNA hypermethylation induced by cancer a CpG islands. Decitabine acts to reduce the quantity of DNA methylation. This has an anti-tumour effect because it can stop the cancer cells from growing and spreading by removing this methylation that has caused the cells to function incorrectly.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because the methylation can be passed from generation to generation. I don't know what exactly they are referring to here with regards to the sensitive periods.</div>
