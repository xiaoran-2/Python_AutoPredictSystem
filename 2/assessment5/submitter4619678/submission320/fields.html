    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation changes in cancer are different depending on tumour types. However we can explain some general features that clearly are key to undertand the development of cancer.<br /><br />DNA methylation in CpG islands is related to silencing expression of genes, by not allowing acces to promoters (rich in CpG). In cancer, often there is hypermethylation of CpG islands which lead to silencing some genes that normally shold be active like tumour supressors, hence reinforcing the development of the disease.<br /><br />In a normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated, avoiding expression and protecting the genome. In cancer cells, this methylation is disrupted and there is a hypomehtylation of these regions that leads to genomic instability, which is a caracteristic of most tumours.<br /><br />The changes in DNA methylation are context dependent and therefore, there will be tumours which are more caracterized by a hypermethylation or by hypomethylation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally the paternal allele is methylated in H19 in such way to not allow the binding of CTCF protein which indirectly inhibits the expression of Igf2. Thus, Igf2 is expressed in the parental allele in normal cells. The maternal allele is active in H19 (not methylated), allowing the CTCF protein to prevent Igf2 expression. This balance is important to assure the right amount of Igf2 expression, and this balance is guaranteed by this parent-of-origin imprinting.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, the methylation pattern of the patternal allele is repeated on the maternal allele. In other words, there is a hypermethylation on the mother's allele which make it "paternal-like" (disruption of imprinting). The consecuence is naturally a double expression of Igf2 which is a growth promoter. As expected, cancer is reinforced this abnormal growth promoter expression.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the inhibitors of DNMT (DNA methylation enzimes). Hence, the use of this drug decreases DNA methylation overall. This can have an anti-tumour effect on tumours that are driven by the hypermethylation of tumour supresor genes (which are inactive by methylation).<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, that means that any pattern of methylation even if induced by drugs, is enzimatically maintained in the daughter cells. However, there are sensitive periods where epigenetic marks are "erased" from the genome. These periods are during pre-implantation embryo and development of primordial germ cells. I think, it would depend as well on what kind of drug is used, but in general, 
the effect of these drugs is genome wide and affecting the whole 
organism. With that said, a pregnant woman for example, should not take any "epigenetic-drug" which could disrupt the natural epigenetic reprogramming of the embrio (we could affect parental imprinting, for example). There's also a possibility that changes in epigenetic pattern could pass through generations via the germ cells, and that's why we should not alter the epigenetic information whenever this reprograming occurs in this sensitive period.<br /><br /></div>
