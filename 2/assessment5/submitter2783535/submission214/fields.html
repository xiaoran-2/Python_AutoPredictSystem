    <h1>Submission 214 from Anon (session_user_id: 89c944ef3c747e6dbff1843c3e39c0898b2930d5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a cytidine deoxynucleoside analogue that selectively inhibits DNA methyltransferases. The incorporation of decitabine into DNA (5-Aza-dCTP) results in an irreversible covalent complex with DNMT1 that inhibits the enzyme and results in DNA hypomethylation, gene activation and the induction of cellular differentiation, senescence and/or apoptosis. The in vitro studies in leukemic cells have demonstrated the decitabine induces differentiation, apoptosis and senescence in the cells, where in solid tumors several studies demonstrate an association between DNA hypermethylation and DNMT overexpression. So the demethylating epigenetic action leads to the reactivation of tumor supressor genes silenced by DNA methylation.<p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a modification in the DNA that is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromossome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent cell generations, but reprogramming of DNA methylation can occur during gametogenesis and after fertilization. <br />DNA methylation within promoter regions (methylated DNA more profoundly affects transcription by interacting with methyl-CpG-binding proteins and associated factors that alter chromatin structure) of genes negatively correlates with expression of the gene except in CpG islands that kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. <span>The majority of CpG islands are found in the promoter regions of genes. The majority of all CG dinucleotides in the genome are found repetitive elements such as rDNA, satellite sequences and centromeric repeats, and are usually unmethylated.<br /></span>In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the gene. Moreover, in cancer cells there is a genome-wide loss of DNA methylation with the regional gain in the CpG islands. This causes genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes but also silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands. Another target of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer are CpG island shores, defined as approximately 2 kb regions surrounding CpG islands. Methylation of shore regions is related to gene expression and has also been detected in different tumor cell lines and nerve sheath tumors. In contrast, no differential methylation of shore regions was detected in different lineages of the murine immune system. Hypermethylation events in usually unmethylated CpG islands are found in a large number of cancer genes. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns is very important for imprinting. Genes are normally expressed from both the maternal and the paternal alleles but at the imprinted loci only the maternal or paternal allele is expressed. In the case of the <i>H19/Igf2</i> loci, the DMRs have enhancer blocking activity and bind CTCF factor in a methylation-sensitive manner. In this locus the methylation is observed in the paternal allele at ICR and no methylation for the maternal allele. CTCF factor bound to an unmethylated DMR (allele on the maternal strand) represses enhancer to promoter interactions needed for <i>Igf2</i> expression and this block is relieved allowing expression when the DMRs are methylated and CTCF binding is prevented.</p><p>In a normal cell (non cancer cell) there is a equilibrium between the H19 from maternal strand and Igf2 from paternal strand. In case of cancer their is a loss of imprinting of <i>IGF2</i> and the <i>H19</i> locus that has been associated with several types of tumors. In Wilms' tumour (and others), imprinted expression of <i>IGF2</i> changes in order that results in maternal allele expression. This is associated with increased methylation and reduced expression from the maternal copy of the tightly linked <i>H19</i> locus.</p><p>(Plass and Soloway, 2002)<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><span>Epigenetic marks like DNA methylation are mitotically heritable so that's why when altering DNA methylation you can have enduring effects on the epigenome. When using drug treatment that alter DNA methylation there is the possibility to alter the levels of DNA methylation and the epigenetic marks will still be present even after cell division. The methyl groups will be passed on continuously, leaving long lasting effects in individuals. <br />The sensitive periods are phases of active remodeling of the epigenome and here epigenetic marks get removed, and new epigenetic marks laid down. We have sensitive periods during germ cell development and during early development. If we alter DNA methylation during these sensitive periods, it would have a large effect on patients, leading to altered epigenomes, gene expression, and phenotype. Due to this is not recomended to prescribe treatments including agents that can change DNA methylation to pregnant women and also in the months before conception.</span></div></div>
