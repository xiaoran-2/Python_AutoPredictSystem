    <div class="field-value">Methylation is the adition of one methyl group to a molecule and it can be observed in DNA, in eucaryotes this process is exclusive of citosine. In human genome the CpG islands (places with hi quantity of C-G dinucleotide) are across the genome and usually there is one in the promoter and is usually demethylated. Methylation is normally asociated with gene silencing. The function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to regulate the expression of the genes some examples of this regulation mechanism is in X inactivation or genomic imprinting. In cancer there is an error in DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes (the enzymes in charge of the methylation) that cause hypermethylation in this islands in the promotor forcing the silencing of the gene. Inside the gene there are repetitive elements like satellites and evolutives remains like transposons, LINES and SINES that normally in the cell are hypermethylated like in the pericentric regions, in cancer there is a general hypomethylation of the genome. In conjuntion this two errors makes possible that cancer exists due to silencing tumor supressor genes and overexpressing protooncogenes transforming them in oncogenes so esencially in cancer the cell has a distorted methylation pattern. <br /><br />centromere //------*--*--*--*-*--*--*-------------------------iiii[&gt;                           (*=methylatd, i=non methylated, [&gt; expression)<br />                         normally methylated          normally not methylated<br />                                      |                                             |<br />                         Hypomethylation                   Hypermethylation<br />                                      \                                            /<br />                                                 -----cancer-----<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting is the process where the expression of an alelle is made depending on the paternal origin. In the H19/IGF2 cluster the paternal allele is normally methylated in severeal sites upstream H19 silencing it's expression, and enhancing the expression of IGF2, in the maternal allele is completly different because this allele is not methylated and therefore not only H19 can be expressed but also due to the expression of H19 enhancers don't stimulate IGF2 making it silent, in the normal cell the paternal allele promote cell growth meanwhile maternal allele acts as an antagonist, in Wilm's tumor there is a loss of imprinting in the maternal allele, showing paternal methylation pattern of the H19 promoter strongly stimulating cell growth and therefore contributing to oncogenesis <br /><br />pat  [     IGF     ]--------------*-*-*-*-*-[H19]     -&gt; + Cell growth \ in cancer   pat  [     IGF     ]--------------*-*-*-*-*-[H19]     -&gt; + Cell growth<br />mat [IGF]--------------i-i-i-i-i-i-[     H19     ]    -&gt; - Cell growth   /  in cancer   mat [     IGF     ]--------------*-*-*-*-*-[H19]    -&gt; + Cell growth</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the article epigenetics is driven towards the idea of cancer treatment and they show some drugs that are ready for human traits including the Decitabine that is a competitive non specific DNMT inhibitor. The impact of this drug is in the enzymes that are in charge of methylation like EZH2 because in cancer cells there is a high amount of histone methylation silencing genes like tumor supressor genes, so this drug inhibits the enzyme depleting this methylation, restoring the normal function of the genes and therefore helping in a antineoplasic fashion. In combination of drugs like DNMT inhibitors, histone deacetylation inhibitors (HDAC inhibitors) slowed the progress of cancer by restoring the normal epigenetic mechanism. The effect of these drugs can stop the growth of cancer cells but can't kill them like a "tumorostatic effect" so in addition to classic antineoplasic drugs pacients may have a better outcome</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is passed to next generation through DNMT's in somatic cells, this epigenetic mark is required for an adecuate embriogenesis, development, sustaining chromosomal stability,the telomere length, and predetermined gene expression states, the DNMT inhibitors like Decitabine affect not only the cancer cells but all the cells because it's not specific. Sensitive periods in epigenetics is referred to the lapse of time where epigenetic marks are erased and reprogramed these events occur during early embriogenesis and germ cell, so an alteration in these sensitive periods would lead to errors in the normal course of the marks probably causing some kind of damage </div>
