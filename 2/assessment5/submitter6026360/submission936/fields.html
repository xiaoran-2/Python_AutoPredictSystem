    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands in the cell is to control gene expression.  When methylation is present, it silences the gene.  When there is no methylation present, a gene is expressed.  In cancer, the methylation that is normally present at a CpG island can be disrupted.  Hypermethylation at CpG islands causes a gene to not be expressed when it should be.  Many genes that are found to be hypermethylated in cancer are involved in cell growth regulation and DNA repair.  One example of a gene that is hypermethylated is MLH1 in colorectal cancer.  This is a mismatch repair gene, and when it is not expressed there are errors in DNA repair and can lead to instability in the genome.<br /><br />DNA methylation is also found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in the genome.  A large portion of the genome is made up of these regions/elements and are typically methylated, which silences their expression.  Many of these areas of the genome are thought to be involved in a structural function in the cell.  When these areas become hypomethylated, genes can be expressed that are not typically expressed in the cell.  If a gene that is not expressed typically is next to an intergenic region that is hypomethylated it can be expressed inadvertently.  <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">When normal imprinting is disrupted, it can lead to cancer developing.  One example of this is the development of Wilm’s tumour development in a person with Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome.  Normally, the paternal allele is methylated at the imprinting control region (ICR), which blocks the binding of the insulator protein CTCF.  This methylation also affects the H19 promoter, silencing it’s expression.  This silencing of the H19 promoter and CTCF not being accessible allows enhancers to activate Igf2 expression.<br /><br />The maternal allele is not methylated.  The CTCF protein binds, H19 is expressed and the enhancers will act on the H19 instead of the Igf2.  In Wilm’s tumour there is not correct imprinting and the maternal allele is acting like the paternal allele, it has hypermethylation of ICR, CTCF protein binding is blocked and enhancers act on Igf2 and there is overexpression.  Igf2 is the human insulin-like growth factor II gene and causes cells to grow and can lead to tumourigenesis.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There are some drugs being used to help treat cancer by working on epigenetic processes.  One example is Decitabine, an agent that demethylates DNA.  This drug inhibits the DNMT1 gene.  The product of this gene is an enzyme that adds a methyl group to cytosine during DNA replication and is crucial for DNA methylation.<br /><br />When DNA methylation is decreased in the cancer cells, the genes that were affected by an excess of methylation return to normal.  For example, a tumour suppressor gene that was turned off by mehtylation has its function restored and can control cell growth again.<br /><br />Since this type of inhibitor is dependent on cell replication, only cancer cells actively dividing are affected by the drug.  Surrounding cells remain unaffected if the optimal dose given.   It is also thought that Decitabine is an antimetabolite and when incorporated into the cell it has a toxic effect, causing cell death. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation have to potential to have effects that last beyond the drug treatment period.  Since some epigenetic marks are heritable, once the cell is changed, those changes will remain for the life of the cell.<br /><br />There are some periods of time where you would avoid treating patients with these types of drugs.  A sensitive period of time is when reprogramming happens, when epigenetic marks are cleared.  This happens during germ cell development and in early embryonic development.  You would not want to treat a woman who could potentially be pregnant, especially during the preimplantation period and during mid-gestation when this reprogramming is happening.  <br /><br />Steps can be taken to avoid these situations.  For example, a woman can undergo egg retrieval and storage of embryos for later implantation before cancer treatment.  I recently heard an interview where strides are being made in storage of eggs, rather than embryos for young women or children who do not have a partner.  <br /><br /></div>
