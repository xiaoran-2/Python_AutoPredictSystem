    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an enzyme-induced chemical modification to the DNA structure. A methyl (−CH3) group is covalently bonded to the 5-carbon on the cytosine base. This process is mediated by one or more of a group of enzymes known as DNA methyltransferases. The methyl group is provided by S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), and this is converted to S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) in the process. This is recycled back to SAM in a folate- and cobalamin-dependant pathway. Biologic methylation in vertebrates occurs only on the cytosine bases, and further only on those linked directly to a guanine by the phosphodiesterase link, forming a CpG dinucleotide pair.Early descriptions documented that the presence of DNA methylation roughly correlated with a decrease in genetic Expression. Altered methylation patterns are known to occur in the DNA of cancer cells. Two patterns have been observed: wide areas of global hypomethylation along the genome, and localized areas of hypermethylation at certain specific sites, the CpG islands, within the gene promoter regions. Based on these patterns, several theories have emerged to implicate DNA methylation mechanisms in carcinogenesis. In fundamental genetic models of cancer, the amplification of protooncogenes, or the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, disrupts the balance that normally controls cell proliferation and drives it through the succession of events leading to full malignant status. Thus, in theory, decreased methylation, and hence relief of transcriptional silencing, may allow the expression of previously quiescent protooncogenes to become active and induce the cell proliferation events . Alternatively, increased methylation at previously unmethylated sites, such as the promoter regions of a tumor suppressor gene, may result in their silencing through inhibition of transcription and their inability to suppress cell proliferation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Increased activity of the IGF2 gene has been associated with many types of cancer.  Normally, the IGF2 gene undergoes genomic imprinting and only the copy inherited from a person's father is active.  In some cancers, however, both the paternal and the maternal copies of the gene are active, increasing the amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 that cells can produce.  This phenomenon is known as loss of imprinting (LOI).  An increased amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 may stimulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells from being destroyed.Loss of imprinting of the IGF2 gene has been identified in several types of cancer known as embryonal tumors.  These tumors include a rare form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor, a cancer of muscle tissue called rhabdomyosarcoma, and a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma.  Although these tumors commonly occur in people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, loss of imprinting of the IGF2 gene has also been seen in people with these tumors who do not have Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.Loss of imprinting of the IGF2 gene has also been found in many other types of cancer, including cancer of blood-forming cells (leukemia) and cancers of the breast, prostate, lung, colon, and liver. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a member of a new class of drugs known as DNA "demethylating"            agents.  When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in            the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and            growth.  When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated,            allowing or promoting cancer. Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold.   One way            that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.             By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes            is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites.             Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When            the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact            with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that            causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

    <div class="field-value"><p>The aim of epigenetic therapy is to reverse the causal epigenetic aberrations that occur in cancer,                     leading to the restoration of a ‘normal epigenome’. Many epigenetic drugs have been discovered in the recent past that can                     effectively reverse DNA methylation and histone modification aberrations that occur in cancer.The remarkable                     discovery that treatment with cytotoxic agents, 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR), lead to the                     inhibition of DNA methylation that induced gene expression and caused differentiation in cultured cells led to the realization                     of the potential use of these drugs in cancer therapy.These nucleoside analogs get incorporated into the DNA of rapidly growing tumor cells during replication and inhibit DNA                     methylation by trapping DNA methyltransferases onto the DNA, leading to their depletion inside the cell.This drug-induced reduction of DNA methylation causes growth inhibition in cancer cells by activating tumor suppressor                     genes aberrantly silenced in cancer. azacitidine and decitabine have now been FDA approved for use in the treatment of myelodysplastic                     syndromes and promising results have also emerged from the treatment of other hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid                     leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia using these drugs.</p></div>
