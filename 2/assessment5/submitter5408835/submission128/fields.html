    <h1>Submission 128 from Anon (session_user_id: e9b301a3c444e0ea83c13cd8c97f3fb8ca9d13ee)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNMT (DNA methyltransferase) inhibitors. It is a DNA-demethylating agent. It may have an anti-tumour effect by demethylating hypermethylated CpG islands.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are normally unmethylated, but methylation of CpG islands can silence tumour suppressor genes, leading to cancer. Intergenic regions are normally methylated, but, if they become unmethylated, this can lead to genomic instability by facilitating illegitimate recombination between repeats, which can lead to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, imprinted genes have the allele from only one parent expressed. Either hypermethylation or hypomethylation of imprinted genes can lead to cancer either by silencing the genes from both parents or by causing alleles from both parents to be expressed. For example, normally, the IGF2/H19 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele which leads to IGF2 expression, and it is unmethylated on the maternal allele which leads to H19 expression. In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele is methylated which leads to an overexpression of IGF2, promoting tumour growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks are mitotically inheritable so the effects of altering DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.<br /><br />During development, there are periods when epigenetic markers are cleared and re-established: these are sensitive periods. These occur during embryogenesis and gametogenesis. Treating patients with epigenetic during these periods could inhibit the epigenetic machinery and prevent the proper markers from being established.<br /></div>
