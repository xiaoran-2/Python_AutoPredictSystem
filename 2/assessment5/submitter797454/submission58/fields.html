    <h1>Submission 58 from Anon (session_user_id: 789f4fbdf99f5528ae92b2d220fbcb90ef1ee88a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, so it lowers the levels of DNA methylation by removing methyl groups from DNA. Thus decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect by activating (removing silencing marks from) tumor-suppressor genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, altering it has long-lasting effects on the epigenome. A sensitive period is one in which the environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup, and in mammals these consist of the period from the gamete to the epiblast stage and the period from the primordial germ cells to the gamete. It would be inadvisable to treat a patient during sensitive periods because it would risk interfering with epigenetic outcomes that were supposed to come of the natural environment.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands normally allows for imprinting and heterochromatin formation (e.g. X inactivation), but in cancer, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, which leads to silencing of genes if the CpG islands are in promoters, which can lead to cancer if the CpG island is in a promoter for a tumor-suppressor gene. In repetitive elements, DNA methylation normally silences the genes because they can have harmful effects on the host if active, and intergenic regions are methylated to alter chromatin structure and to affect the transcription of genes coding for ncRNA. In cancer, DNA methylation in repetitive elements and intergenic regions is downregulated, so there is overexpression of genes there that can lead to cancer because of abberant ncRNA and repetitive element gene expression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, there is methylation at the ICR between Igf2 and H19, so CTCF cannot bind there, so enhancers downstream of H19 upregulate Igf2 expression and there is less H19 expression. In the maternal allele. there is no methylation at this spot, so CTCF binds there and (because CTCF is an insulator protein) prevents these enhancers from upregulating Igf2 expression, so they instead upregulate H19 expression and there is less Igf2 expression. The ICR at the H19/Igf2 cluster is hypermethylated in Wilm's tumor, leading to increased Igf2 expression. This contributes to cancer because Igf2 is a growth factor, so increased Igf2 transcription leads to increased cell growth and can lead to cancer, like with most growth factor pathways.<br /></div>
