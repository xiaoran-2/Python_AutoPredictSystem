    <h1>Submission 85 from Anon (session_user_id: 2b20961c37b0e4c511e83d4d6bbbef07871bbce9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The effects of altering DNA methylation within a cell carry forward to subsequent mitotic divisions of the cell. So if, for example, methyl groups are removed from the dna in a cell, then their effect will be absent from all succeeding generations of the cell.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming when epigenetic marks are removed and restored. Different parts of the genome undergo different epigenetic processes depending on the sensitive period.<br /><br />The two sensitive periods with respect to epigenetics are during early embryonic development and germ cell development.<br /><br />Interfering with the epigenetic reprogramming during a sensitive period likely will result in epigenetic abnormalities. The epigenetic machinery has not evolved to withstand insults during these periods.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation when cancer is present can either be increased (hypermethylation) or decreased (hypomethylation). The presence of over-methylation can result in the disabling of tumor suppressors, and the presence of under-methylation can result in the enabling of oncogenes (growth-promoting).<br /><br />Hypermethylation example:<br /><br />CpG islands are normally unmethylated, which means that nearby promoters of genes are unsuppressed. Methylation of these islands can results in the disabling the promoters and thereby suppressing related genes. If these genes are tumor suppressor genes, cancer results.<br /><br />Hypomethylation example:<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated normally. Cancer disrupts these areas by removing methylation and causing genomic instability. These destabilized areas are susceptible to:<br /><ol><li>undesirable genomic recombination</li><li>transposition of elements within these areas</li><li>activation of repeats with potential undesirable gene expression</li><li>disruption of neighboring genes</li></ol>All of these effects increase the likelihood of tumors, for example, by disrupting the expression of tumor suppression genes or by increasing the expression of oncogenes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can result in an overexpression or underexpression of genes. If an oncogene is overexpressed, then cancer is more likely to occur. If a tumor suppressor gene is underexpressed, then cancer is more likely to occur.<br /><br />In the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster, there is no methylation on the maternal side. As a result, Igf2 is not expressed because the insulator protein, CTCP, which binds to the unmethylated ICR, blocks the enhancers from activating Igf2. Instead, the enhancers enhance the expression of H19.<br /><br />The ICR and the H19 gene on the paternal side are methylated. When CTCP is absent, chromatin looping results in Igf2 being the preferred destination of the enhancers thereby increasing Igf2 expression. The H19 is not expressed because of the methylation that spreads toward H19 from the ICR and disables H19.<br /><br />Wilm's tumors result from hypermethylation: the maternal cluster acts like the paternal cluster, resulting in an over-expression of Igf2.<br /><br />Disruption of imprinting, in this case hypermethylation of the Igf2/H19 cluster, results in an overproduction of the Igf2 growth factor, which contributes to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that reduces DNA methylation.<br /><br />If a promoter of a suppressor gene is methylated, then the suppressing effect of the gene is absent since it is not expressed. By demethylating the promoter, the suppressor gene has the opportunity to be expressed and do its job of suppressing tumors.</div>
