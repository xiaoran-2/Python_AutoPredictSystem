    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene transcription, and its role in carcinogenesis has been a topic of considerable interest in the last few years. Alterations in DNA methylation are common in a variety of tumors as well as in development. Of all epigenetic modifications, hypermethylation, which represses transcription of the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes leading to gene silencing, has been most extensively studied. However, global hypomethylation has also been recognized as a cause of oncogenesis. New information concerning the mechanism of methylation and its control has led to the discovery of many regulatory proteins and enzymes. The contribution of dietary folate and methylene terahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms to methylation patterns in normal and cancer tissues is under intense investigation. As methylation occurs early and can be detected in body fluids, it may be of potential use in early detection of tumors and for determining the prognosis. Because DNA methylation is reversible, drugs like 5′-azacytidine, decitabine, and histone deacetylase inhibitors are being used to treat a variety of tumors. Novel demethylating agents such as antisense DNA methyl transferase and small interference RNA are being developed, making the field of DNA methylation wider and more exciting.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> imprinting has been linked to certain cancers . For instance, Wilms' tumor is a type of embryonic kidney cancer that is associated with the <i>IGF2</i>/<i>H19</i> locus on chromosome 11. <i>H19</i> is a noncodingRNA of unknown function with properties that can suppress growth. <i>IGF2</i>codes for insulin-like growth factor 2, a growth factor highly expressed in many types of tumors. These two genes are both imprinted, and normally, only the maternal copy of <i>H19</i> and the paternal copy of <i>IGF2</i> are expressed (Steenman <i>et al.</i>, 1994). In cancer cells, however, both <i>H19</i> and <i>IGF2</i>typically lose their imprinting (Moulton <i>et al.</i>, 1994; Steenman <i>et al.</i>, 1994). Scientists hypothesize that if the function of <i>H19</i> is to turn off <i>IGF2</i>expression, then the loss of <i>H19</i> expression could result in overexpression of<i>IGF2</i>, thus leading to tumorigenesis </p><p></p><p>Loss of imprinting (i.e., the loss of normal allele-specific gene expression) can also result in cancer when an imprinted, normally silent allele that provides cells with a growth advantage is activated, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth and division. For example, along with Wilms' tumor, loss of imprinting of the <i>IGF2</i> gene is associated with many other types of cancer, including lung, colon, and ovarian tumors</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>

    <div class="field-value">thalidomide and DES, have demonstrably shown that intergenerational adverse epigenetic effects and can be severe. DES which was used to prevent miscarriages and other pregnancy complications between 1938 and 1971, cause cancer in reproductive tracts later in life. other adverse associations have been identified in DES-exposed women and their offspring, and animal studies have shown effects in the next generation, a clear demonstration of transgenerational epigenetic effects.<span> DES and thalidomide are frightening, and you’d think that lessons would have been learned from those experiences,  The effects of DES and thalidomide on the children of the women given those drugs were rooted in epigenetics, yet some of our most popular pharmaceuticals today also have deleterious effects on epigenetics. Is it possible that we learned nothing and the harm brought on by drugs given to millions  today (drugs like fluoroquinolone antibiotics, SSRIs, statins, and others are prescribed to millions of people) </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Because DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling play such a central role in many types of epigenic inheritance, the word "epigenetics" is sometimes used as a synonym for these processes. However, this can be misleading. Chromatin remodeling is not always inherited, and not all epigenetic inheritance involves chromatin remodeling.</p><div>DNA associates with histone proteins to form chromatin.</div><p></p><ol><li>Because the <u>phenotype</u> of a cell or individual is affected by which of its genes are transcribed, heritable<strong> <u>transcription state</u></strong> can give rise to epigenetic effects. There are several layers of regulation of <u>gene expression</u> One way that genes are regulated is through the remodeling of chromatin. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and the <u>histones</u>proteins with which it associates. If the way that DNA is wrapped around the histones changes, gene expression can change as well. Chromatin remodeling is accomplished through two main mechanisms:<br /></li></ol></div>
