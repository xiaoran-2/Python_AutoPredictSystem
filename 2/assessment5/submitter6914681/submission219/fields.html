    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are
very commonly found on gene promoters. They are usually unmethylated so the
gene can be expressed. In contrast, in cancer cells, CpG islands are methylated
silencing gene expression. Silencing the expression of a tumour suppressor gene
will contribute to cancer as the cell cycle is no longer under a regulated control.</p>

<p><span>Both intergenic
regions and repetitive elements are methylated in a normal cell in order to maintain
genetic integrity and stability. In a cancer cell we would find them
unmethylated and thus, active and in an “open structure”.  </span></p>

<p>In the intergenic
regions cryptic transcription “start” or “splice” sites could be activated,
leading to transcription interference, also in surrounding regions. </p>

<p>The activation
of repeats could lead them to make a copy of themselves and “jump” (transpose)
to another place in the genome, disrupting a codding region of a gene or a
regulatory region, making that gene or regulatory region lose their function.</p>

<p><span>The “open structure”
 of the chromatin (euchromatin) and the similarity
of the repeat-sequences could cause a misalignment followed by an illegitimate
recombination between repeats in regions of two different chromosomes that
would never go into recombination in a normal cell (In a normal cell
recombination should only happen between two equivalent regions of the
different copies of the same chromosome). The consequence of this process would
be a reciprocal translocation. </span></p>

<p><span>So the overall
consequences of disrupted DNA methylation in these regions would be deletions,
insertions, duplications and translocations. These structural aberrations can
cause, as it has been explained before, loss of the natural function in cell
growth related genes – what would upset the cell cycle- and, more generally,
genomic instability, which has been proven to be a key feature of several
diseases, including cancer, both in mouse-models and in humans. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal
chromosome both the Imprint Control Region (ICR) and the H19 gene promoter are
methylated, so Igf2 gene expression is enhanced.</p>

<p>In the maternal
chromosome the ICR is not methylated so a protein called CTCF can bind the ICR,
insulating Igf2 gene from the enhancers that now can act on H19 long non coding
RNA, which gets expressed.</p>

<p>In Wilm´s tumour
ICR in the maternal chromosome is also methylated so H19 is silenced and Igf2 is
expressed in both chromosomes.</p>

<p><span>Igf2 is a growth
promoting factor, a proto-oncogene. An overexpression of this gene will lead
the cell into an uncontrolled division and tumour growth.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a
DNA-demethylating agent, an inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferase enzyme (DNMT),
so it would fall into de DNMT inhibitor class. </p>

<p>These kind of
epigenetic inhibitors are nucleoside analogues, so they can become substrate
for DNA replication machinery and get incorporated to the DNA during cell
division, substituting the natural nucleotide, in this case cytosine. When the
DNMT enzyme recognizes the drug as its substrate and initiates the methylation
process, it gets irreversibly bound to the DNA, so the DNMT function gets
blocked.</p>

<p><span>As it can be
deduced from the previous paragraph, decitabine is cell division dependent: it
acts when the DNA is replicating and copying the methylation marks. As one of
the main features of a tumour is the abnormally high rate of cell division,
cancer cells will be much more susceptible to this kind of epigenetic
inhibitors than healthy cells. However the exact mechanism of action is still
unknown.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is
maintained because of the nature of DNA molecule, which is replicated in a
semi-conservative way. If a DNA molecule is methylated, this mark will pass on right
after replication thanks to a DNA methyltransferase whose substrate is the hemi
methylated DNA daughter strand. A drug that alters DNA methylation will have
beyond-the-period-of-treatment effects due to the fact that methylation marks –
or the lack of them - are mitotically heritable.</p>

<p><span> A sensitive period is the time when epigenetic
reprogramming occurs, when epigenetic marks are cleared and re-set. We can
identify several sensitive periods: early embryo development, primary germ cell
and germ cell development and tissue specific differentiation. </span></p>

<p><span>Sensitive
periods are under epigenetic control which may be altered by changes in environment,
such as drug therapy focused on epigenetic marks. These alterations cause
health issues (imprinting disorders, strokes, diabetes), changes on the lifespan,
reduction of fertility, etc. as has been shown in numerous studies in humans
and other animal-models. Although for some of the diseases mentioned above is
difficult to find a formal proof, it seems clear that treating patients during
sensitive periods, when changes in environment may have the greatest effect on
the epigenome, would not be advisable.</span></p></div>
