    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands that are targets of DNA
methylation, are often found in the promotor regions and regulate gene
expression. Additionally intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually
methylated to maintain genomic stability. In cancer cells, the CpG islands in promotor regions of tumor
suppressors are hypermethylated, reducing suppressor activity that potentially
leads to uncontrolled cell growth. Additionally, global methylation in the
intergenic regions and repetitive elements are reduced, allowing oncogene
expression, transposable element activity, or antisense transcripts to increase and
contribute to uncontrolled cell growth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">By inhibiting DNA
methyltransferase function, Decitabine treatment leads to reduced DNA
methylation, which includes promotor regions of cell-growth regulatory genes. Because
these epigenetic changes can be inherited mitotically, potentially allowing
greater tumor-suppressor gene expression, the tumor-effect in Decitabine-
treated cells can be reduced.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Mitotically heritable epigenetic
patterns can reduce oncogene expression or increase tumor suppressor expression
in future cell growth, therefore epigenetic altering drugs could have lasting
effects beyond initial treatment. These drugs are readily available for older
patients, but is not suited for younger patients such as pregnant women or
people planning on having children. Because primordial germ cell and embryonic
development experience reprogramming of epigenetic patterns for future growth,
these sensitive periods are susceptible to exogenous influences that lead to permanent changes in a fetus or gametes.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
Igf2/ H19 cluster relies on the same enhancer that can not simultaneously act
on both loci. In the maternal allele, the unmethylated intergenic region allows
for protein binding, which prevents Igf2 access to the enhancer and allows for
H19 transcription. The opposite occurs in the paternal allele, where a
methylated intergenic region spreads to H19, allows the enhancer to act on Igf2
and prevents H19 expression. In Wilm’s tumor, both alleles are paternally
imprinted and Igf2 is overexpressed, and excess growth factors and loss of
tumor suppressing genes contribute to cancer.</p>
