    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the most studied epigenetic change in genome is the methylation
of DNA. It contributes to epigenetic mechanisms like imprinting, X-chromosome
inactivation and formation of heterochromatin. The most common DNA methylation
which directly controls gene expression is methylation at CpG islands. Usually
DNA methylation at CpG island is associated with switching off of the gene
downstream to it.</p>

<p><span>In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated. While normal cells have optimum
expression of tumor suppressor genes, hypermethylation of CpG island of these
genes in cancer however, causes switching off of these genes.  As a result the cancer progresses.</span></p>

<p>Similarly, hypermethylation of DNA can cause cancer by overexpression
of growth promoting genes as in case of Wilm’s tumor.</p>

<p>In contrast to hypermethylation of CpG island, the intergenic and
repetitive elements are found to be hypomethylated in case of Cancer cells,
which are otherwise normally methylated. Methylation of these regions provide
stability to the genome. If these regions are hypomethylated, as in cancer
cells, then illegitimate recombination, activation of cryptic promotors and
disruption of neighbouring genes occur. Moreover, hypomethylation in ICRs can
cause loss of imprinting and hypomethylation of CpG poor promoter can result in
activation of genes.</p>

<p><span>In these ways the change in DNA methylation patterns can lead to
cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A
number of epigenetic mechanisms have been found to contribute to cancer. One of
them is the hypermethylation of DNA which leads to loss of imprinting. Wilm’s
tumor is an example where the H19/Igf2 cluster loses imprinting and turns cell
into cancerous type.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In
normal cells, the imprint control region is unmethylated in maternal allele
while it is methylated in paternal allele that is, it is paternally imprinted.
In maternal allele, CTCF (an insulator protein), blocks ifg2 from downstream
enhancer. As a result H19 gets expressed. While in paternal allele the ICR
(Imprint Control Region) is methylated. As a result CTCF cannot bind to the ICR
and hence there is no blocking of enhancer. As a result igf2 gets expressed
from paternal allele.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In
case of Wilm’s tumor,<span> the imprinting of Igf2 gene
is disrupted. This disrupting of H19/Igf2 cluster leads to overexpression of
igf2 gene. In fact, the dose is doubled. This is an example of overexpression
of growth promoting gene. In this case due to overexpression of igf2, the cell
proliferates and with additional hits leads to cancer ultimately.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In
the article “Cancer’s epicenter” published in The Economist, several drugs that
affect the epigenetic processes are described. One of the important drugs
described in the article that may be used to treat cancer is Decitabine. It is
generally used for treatment of myelodysplatic syndromes.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Decitabine
belongs to DNA-demethylating class of antibiotics. It acts by removing methyl
groups from CpG island of DNA. In doing so, it can activate those Tumor
suppressor genes which were actually switched off by hypermethylation. This
leads to treatment of cancer. The drug acts as demethylating agent by
inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The tumor suppressor genes are, by nature, expressed to suppress
any aberrant uncontrollable growth of the cells. By activating these genes,
cells can retain their normal character and hence recover from cancerous
growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the article published in the economist, Dr. Stephen Baylin
states that epigenetic drugs acted in lasting way that made patients
susceptible to standard chemotherapy.
By lasting way he meant that the epigenetic changes are passed on during cell
division to the daughter cells and to further generations until they are
deleted deliberately.</p>

<p>Epigentic changes in genome are more susceptible in certain periods. The
stage of development where the genome is highly susceptible to the epigenetic
changes is the sensitive period. It is generally during the reprogramming of
epigenetic marks. The two major sensitive periods for epigenetic changes are
the stage of early development of zygote to the embryo and the stage of
primordial germ cell development.</p>

<p><span>It is generally inadvisable to treat patients during the sensitive
period. It is so because treating patients during this time leads to undesirable
epigenetic changes. It may cause for example loss of imprinting,
hypermethylation of CpG islands or demethylation of intergenic and repetitive
elements. These all types of changes in epigenome leads to long lasting adverse
effects in organism throughout its lifespan. This is why it is inadvisable to
treat patients with epigenetic drugs during the sensitive period.</span></p></div>
