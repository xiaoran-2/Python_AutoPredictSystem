    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">In general, CpG islands are hypomethylated in normal cells, regardless of transcriptional state, whereas in cancer cells the CpG islands (and shores) can become hypermethylated, which can result in gene silencing of a downstream gene.  When these hypermethylated CpG islands silence the expression of tumor suppressor genes, they can cumulatively contribute to oncogenesis by either by conferring a heritable advantage (e.g. proliferation, avoiding cell death, etc.) or by disrupting genomic stability (e.g. DNA repair genes).  <br /><br />With respect to intergenic regions and repetitive elements, the opposite is true.  In normal cells, these regions are typically methylated, but become hypermethylated in cancer cells.  The methylation of repeats in normal cells (for example) serves to silence transposon expression and translocation.  In cancer or protocancer cells, the hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions causes widespread genomic instability by allowing illegitimate homologous recombination (of otherwise inaccessible heterochromatin), increased disruptive transopon activity of repeats, and dysregulated expression by activation or disruption of promoters.  The effects of this increased genomic instability can favor further "hits" towards the development of cancer, or enhance the cancer's progression by further altering it's gene expression profile.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting disruption in cancer can arise from hyper- hypomethylation, but the H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of disruption caused by hypermythylation.<br /><br />In normal cells, the paternal allele has a methylated imprinting control region, which allows the enhancers to drive expression of Igf2.  In the maternal allele, the unmethylated imprinting control region allows the binding of the insulator CTCF, so the enhancer acts on H19 (driving its expression), while Igf2 remains silenced.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor both alleles are hypermethylated in the imprinting control region, so Igf2 is expressed on both the paternal and maternal alleles, resulting in ~two-fold overexpression.  Since Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene, this can lead to tumorogenesis.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Despite the Economist article saying that Decitabine is a hypermethylating agent, the drug is actually a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor, so it would lead to hypomethylation of DNA.  Decitabine is a nucleoside analog incorporated into the DNA of replicating cells.  It irreversibly binds DNMTs, destroying their functionality.  The reduced concentration of DNMTs in the cell results in reduced methylation of DNA.  This could have an anti-tumour effect on some cancers (e.g. heamatological tumors) if the cancers are dependent on hypermethylation-mediated silencing of tumor suppressor genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Sine DNA methylation states are heritable, altering the status in progenitor cells can durably alter the status in daughter cells. For example, removing hypermethylation of CpG islands near tumor suppressor genes can restore their expression, which will be maintained in daughter cells.  This can be a double-edged sword too, since these effects can heribitable when they unintentionally have their effect during sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming (during germ cell development and before implantation of blastocysts [early development]).  Exposure to these drugs when cells are actively erasing and restoring epigenetic markers genome-wide could pathologically alter this process and have permanent unpredictable downstream effects.<br /></div>
