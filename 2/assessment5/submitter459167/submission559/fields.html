    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is as an epigenetic silencing mark and contributes to genome stability.<br /><br />DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer in two ways: a) genome-wide hypomethylation; and b) locus-specific hypermethylation.<br /><br />Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer in ways that are often tumour-specific, but as an example, hypermethylation of a CpG island may lead to silencing of tumour suppressor genes.<br /><br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to support genome stability.<br /><br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer as hypomethylation.<br /><br />Disruption of DNA methylation (hypomethylation) in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to cancer by causing euchromatin structure which, in turn, leads to reduced barrier to insertions, deletions, and reciprocal translocations of such elements throughout the genome.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/IGF2 cluster in cancer is an example of a mechanism known as loss of imprinting (LOI).  IGF2 codes for an insulin-like growth factor, a growth promoter.  H19 is a growth suppressor.<br /><br />In the normal case, the maternal copy of the IGF2 gene is silenced (imprinted) via the normal expression of an imprinting control region (ICR); the paternal copy of the ICR is methylated thus preventing silencing of the paternal copy of the IGF2 gene.  The result is that normally, the paternal copy only is expressed.  The ICR is also known as the H19 differentially methylated region.  In the normal case, therefore, the maternal H19 is expressed (as it is not methylated) and the paternal H19 is silenced (as it is methylated).<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor the maternal ICR for IGF2 is also methylated.  In terms of gene expression there is a double impact: a) growth promoting IGF2 is expressed in both paternal and maternal alleles; and b) growth suppressor H19 is silenced in both paternal and maternal alleles.  At the clinical level the result is a population of cells stimulated to (tumour) growth concurrent with the loss of factors that would normally destroy a damaged cell.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to is DNA-demethylating agent and antimetabolite designed to target the epigenetic machinery itself.<br /><br />The impact of Decitabine as a DNA-demethylating agent is to inhibit DNA methyl transferases which may offset the hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes and thus (re)promoting control of cell growth.   <br /><br />Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect in two ways.  First, as noted above, if the DNA demethylation is such as to offset the hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes then natural mechanisms for control of cell growth my be reestabilshed.  Similarly, the impact of Decitabine as an anti-tumour agent is as a nucleotide analogue which blocks cellular function, and because the tumour cell divides more rapidly, will lead to cell death (sooner than it would in a normal cell).<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.<br /><br />Sensitive periods of development are primarily during embryogenesis and gametogenesis (germ cell development).during which epigenetic reprogramming and/or cellular differentiation occur.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable, because these are periods when epigenetic reprogramming occurs.  Treatments that alter DNA methylation would introduce an additional signal on top of normal epigenetic reporgramming that could have both genome-wide effects (e.g., genomic stability) and locus-specific effects (e.g., silencing tumour suppressor genes).<br /></div>
