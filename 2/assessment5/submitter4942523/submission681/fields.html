    <div class="field-value">There are some methylation in a normal cells' DNA, more specifically, hypermethylation into intergenic regions, repetitive element, even in some intron genes, but not in CpG islands. On other hand, on cancer cells occurs the opposite way and CpG islands presents hypermethylation, as a consequence, tumour suppressor genes are silenced, and all this produce hit by hit epimutations until form tumours, the worst thing is that DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Dna methylation on CpG islands contributes on the progressing alteration on cancer cells forming hyperplasia, neoplasia, even in cells with metastasis. However, those CpG islands hypermethylated could be use as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of certain types of cancer wich allows to choose a better adequate treatment. <br /><br /><div>Another Function of DNA methylation is to mantain genomic stability, it means to avoid reciprocal translocation, deletion or insertion in chromosomes. It is because of there are repetitive elements a long of the chromosomes that could repeat in other chromosome, but recombination can't occur because those repetitive elements are heavily methylated and heterchromatonized. Genome-wide hypomethylations produce tumourgenesis that progress with the time; and it is due to hypomethylation to intergenic and repetitive elements that makes heterochromatin not to be densely packaged and permit illegitimate recombination. Repetitive elements hypomethylated also makes copies of themselves that can jump into other part of the genome and may disrupt another coding region of the gene and/or activate their neighboring genes that end up in genomic instability and cancer.</div><div><br /></div><div>In conclusion,  tumours can be produced by different reasons, one of them, is by hypermethylation of CpG islands, and another one of hypomethylation of repetitive elements and integenic regions.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There is an imprint control region (ICR) on Igf2/H19 cluster. This ICR is methylated in the paternal allele and no methylated in the maternal allele. So, when the ICR is not methylated (maternal allele), CTCF binds its insulator element so that enhancers act on H19 (inducing its expression) but Igf2 keep silent on the maternal allele. In the other hand, in the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, in consequence CTCF can't bind and enhancers act on Igf2 inducing its expression from this paternal allele but H19 mantains silent. However, When there is an hypermethylation on this ICR on the maternal allele, it produce loss of imprinting and as a consequence Igf2 is expressed in maternal allele too that causes doble dose of Igf2. This Igf2 is a growth promoter related to Wilm's tumour, a particular chilhood kidney genome. This disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster often appears in preneoplastic tissues and might be very early events in tumorogenesis. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent and it is used for hypomethylation the blood cells in treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. The combination of decitabine and histone-deacetylase inhibitor can slow solid tumour growth like in people with lung cancer. Also it provokes good reaction on the routine chemotherapeutic drugs employed later of them. </div><div><br /></div><div>The point is that Decitabine hypomethylate DNA of tumoral cells, an epigenetic change that can be passed during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until its activity be totally erased and not to return. Finally, epigenetic therapies like Decitabine may stop a cancer growing without killing all its cells.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, that's the reason why it can have enduring effects on the epigenome, because DNA methymation is transmited to daugther and granddaughter cells by mithosis. There are two  sensitive periods when epigenetic changes can occur, early embryon development and primordial germ cells development.Those sensitive periods are important beacuse the epigenetic factors are released and re-stablish again.</div><div><br /></div><div>In medicine, Doctors can apply this kind of drugs during any period of tumoral growing only if this tumour is formed by hypermethylation But if the tumour is produced by hypomethylation and as consequence by genomic instability, so there is no reason to use this drug. </div></div>
