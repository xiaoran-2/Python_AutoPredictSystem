    <div class="field-value"><span>CpG islands of the promoter, in the case of cancer tend to be hypermethylated. This causes the underlying gene is silenced. High methylation in CpG sites is called CIMP. This
 is associated with clonicopatológicas patient characteristics such as 
age, gender, tumor location, microsatellite instability and genetic 
mutation in the BRAF gene. Aberrant DNA methylation is found in regions surrounding the CpG islands, which is related to gene expression. Typically,
 CpG islands in the promoters, have high density and are usually kept 
free of methylation regardless of their state of activity. Many
 development genes are silenced by H3K27me3 amadre embryonic cells, are 
silenced by DNA methylation in cells cáncer.En For intergenic regions 
typically contain H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 domains. <span>These
 regions contribute to the modulation of cell cycle steps in the cell, 
and when induced p53 methylation levels are not adequate (not 
methylated), does not allow the normal activity.</span></span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is an antimetabolite, which belongs to the class of drugs known as "demethylating" agents. Decitabine has antitumor effect, decreasing the methylation of cancer cells, since as explained by Dr. Issa, "cancer cells depend on DNA methylation for survival much more than normal cells." The impact of this drug has methylation is being demethylating, produces a memory cell as an antitumor response<span>.</span></span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Mechanisms of imprinting has been described for H19 and Igf2 gene.H19,active on the maternal chromosome but not paternal; Igf2 whereas reversed.Adjusting this occurs thanks to the stamp where the differential methylation proceeds.This insulator is located between both genes and is responsible for limiting the activity of an enhancer with respect to both genes. If the insulator is not methylated (on the maternal chromosome), a factor binding imprinting center called CTCF is attached to it,limiting the effect of the nearest gene enhancer him in here H19.When the insulator is methylated (on the paternal chromosome),the binding factor can not be attached and the effect of the enhancer can reach the first gene (Igf2 in this case), which may be expressed.In the absence of methylase may completely silenced Igf2 expression, which in turn stresses the importance of the activity for the maintenance of this regulatory mechanism.Wilms tumor regard, researchers have found changes in imprinting mechanisms in regions 11p13 and 11p15.5 11;well as 14q32.For 11p modification almost always involves the loss of the maternal allele. The 11p15 region containing the growth factor gene IGF2 (paternal expression) and inhibitors of growth genes and CDKNIC H19 (maternal expression).Thus,the loss of imprinting determines biallelic IGF2 expression.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
