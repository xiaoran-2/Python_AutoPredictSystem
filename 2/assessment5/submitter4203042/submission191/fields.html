    <div class="field-value"><p>CpGs tend to cluster
together into Islands, which in a normal cell are (generally)
unmethylated, and this allows them to act as promoters of genes. 
</p>
<p>In a cancer cell these
CpG-Islands become methylated, their promoter function is
interrupted, leading to silencing of the gene expression.  There are
two mechanism responsible for this gene silencing, the main one whereby CpG-methylation leads to a repressive chromatin structure
(the DNA is more tightly wound) making it harder for the genes to be
activated. In a secondary mechanism, the methylation prevents
transcription factors from binding altering the gene expression, and
this can also switch on normally silenced oncogenes.</p>
<p>CpG island
hypermethylation can silence tumour suppressor genes (this occurs
more frequently than genetic mutations)  leading to the development
of cancerous cells. Sometimes the cancer is caused by
CpG-Island hypermethylation at a single gene, in other cases  hypermethylation of CpG-Islands at a set of genes can occur. 
</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of CpG
Island Shores (2kb either side of the island) may also play a role in
the gene silencing as there is a strong correlation between  their
methylation status and the gene expression.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>CpGs in Intergenetic
Regions and Repetitive Elements in normal cells are generally
methylated as this maintains genomic integrity, protecting these
portions of the DNA from the  mechanisms that occur in cancerous
cells.</p>
<p>In cancer cells these
Intergenetic Regions and Repetitive Elements lose their methylation
marks and become hypomethylated.  This reduced methylation means the
chromatin structure becomes more open and these regions are more
accessible. This can lead to a number of genetic instabilities such
as; the occurrence of deletions, insertions, illegitimate
recombinations including those between different chromosomes
(reciprocal translocations), the activation of repeats and cryptic
promoters, and the disruption of neighbouring genes. All of these
factors could lead to cell damage, cell death or tumorogenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the Paternal Allele
the Imprint Control Region downstream of H19 is hypermethylated
and this spreads to H19 itself, hence H19 is NOT expressed. However
the H19 Enhancers are still functional, and, unable to access H19, they now act upon lgf2 and activate its expression.</p>
<p>In the Maternal Allele
the Imprint Control Region is unmethylated and an Insulator Protein CTCF binds to it.
This has two effects, firstly it prevents the methylation of H19, so
the enhancers act upon it and H19 IS expressed. Secondly CTCF
insulates lgf2 and prevents its expression.<br /></p>
<p>Thus in a normal cell
the paternal allele is expressing lgf2, and the maternal allele
expresses H19.<br /></p>
<p>In Wilm's Tumour (a
type of childhood kidney cancer), the maternal line loses its
imprinting and behaves like the paternal allele with the Imprint Control Region and H19 both becoming methylated. This results in a double dose of lgf2
expression (compared with a normal cell), and little or no H19 expression.<br /></p>
<p>This disruption of the
imprinting at the H19/lgf2 cluster, leads to the over expression of
lgf2, which is a growth promoter gene and the over expression of the
hormone leads to the development of tumours in Wilm's and other cancers.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a
DNA-MethylTransferase (DNMT) Inhibitor. 
</p>
<p>DNMT maintains the
methylation status when a cell undergoes mitotis. A symmetrically
methylated strand of DNA will seperate to create two daughter cells,
each of which will be hemimethylated (only methylated on one strand).
DNMTs are preferentially attracted to hemimethylated-DNA, and they
lay down the methylation marks on the other strand, hence maintaining
the epigenetic marks through cell devision.<br /></p>
<p>Decitabine inhibits
this process by binding up the DNMTs so they can no longer do their
job, and successive generations of cells become de-methylated, but
this only works for cells that are replicating.<br /></p>
<p>The reason that
Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect are twofold. Firstly cancer
cells are likely to replicate at a much faster rate than normal
cells, and are therefore affected more by this inhibitor effect.
Secondly the methylation marks that are causing the epigenetic
alterations are blocked, and consequently become reversed.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic mutations
(unlike genetic ones) are Reversible. For this reason drugs that alter
the DNA-methylation state can initiate reversals of epigenetic
mutations. The methylation changes brought about by these drugs are then passed on  through successive generations, as the cells undergoes
mitosis. This will consequently have an enduring effect on the
epigenome, as these reversed methylation states will be passed onto
all subsequent daughter cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are
those times when epigenetic programming is being reset.  Epigenetic reprogramming of the marks on the maternal and paternal
genome are achieved through slightly different mechanisms, but effectively they undergo de-methylation (removal of existing marks) and then
re-methylation with new marks.<br /></p><p>Sensitive periods occurs during early embryonic development and germ cell development.<br /></p>
<p>During sensitive
periods the cells are susceptible to environmental influences. The
use of a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery, at the point in
time where the epigenetic marks are being cleared and reset, has the
potential for major negative implications if the resetting of marks
is disrupted (or even stopped). Hence the use of such drugs in young
people should be approached with extreme caution<br /></p></div>
