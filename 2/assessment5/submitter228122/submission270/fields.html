    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><strong>DNA methylation in normal and cancer is almost reciprocal situation</strong>. <strong>In normal cells intergenic and repetitive regions are methylated &amp; CpG islands are free of methylation</strong>, whereas in cancer cells CpG islands are methylated &amp; repetitive and intergenic regions are un-methylated. <strong>As repetitive and intergenic regions contributes large portion of genome this leads to genome wide hypomethylation and local (CpG island)  hypermethylation, utlimately landing to genomic instability and silencing of tumor suppressor genes which promotes cancer.</strong> As methylation is mitotically heritable tumor suppressor gene remain silent generation to generation, promoting cancer. demetylation of repetitive and intergenic regions causes<strong> illegitimate recombination which produces abnormal karyotypes.</strong></span><strong></strong><br /></p><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Hypermethylation of ICR1 region which controls the activity of H19/Igf2 cluster
causes the cancer, Because in case of <strong>hypermethylation leads to loss/silencing of H19
activity and increases the Igf2 activity </strong>since<strong> H19 which suppresses
the growth and Igf2 which promotes</strong> <strong>the growth</strong> whereas there expression are balanced
in normal cells. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As
decitabine is
a DNA-demethylating agents and it belongs to <strong><u>DNA </u></strong><span><span><strong><u>methyltransferase inhibitors</u></strong> <strong>(DNMTi)</strong></span>, it removes the methylation of hyper methylated
areas and balances the methylation. <a title="Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine">Use decitabine can slow down
the growth of tumor because it work same as azacitidine</a> which is already
tested for advance on people with advance lung cancer.</span> <strong>DNMTi binds irreversibly</strong> (permanently attaches) <strong>to DNA methyltransferses (DNMTs) </strong>and inhibits mthylation of DNA. So they have anti-tumor effect through inhibition of DNMTs but it is <strong>cell division dependent</strong> as it copy-pasting of methylation marks only during cell division.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the classical example of epigenetic mark.
Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division and have their effect on next
generation, until they are actively erased &amp; once they erased they do not return. In this way the drug that alters
the DNA methylation has effect beyond the period of drug treatment. <br /></p>
