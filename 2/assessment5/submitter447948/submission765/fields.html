    <div class="field-value">Normal and cancer cells show distinct changes in methylation levels of various genomic features.<br /><br />In normal mammalian somatic cells <strong>CpG islands</strong> in gene promoter regions tend to be hypomethylated, which makes the promoters accessible to transcription factors and positively correlates to the with the expression of the related genes. However promoter-associated <strong>CpG islands</strong> are shown to be highly methylated in cancer. The hypermethylation of promoter regions results in silencing of important  onco-suppressor genes and subsequently in disruption of cell cycle and DNA repair mechanisms.<br /><br />The <strong>intergenic and repetitive elements</strong> in normal mammalian somatic cells are found to be highly methylated and kept in closed chromatin. This allows to repress transposon activity and increases the genomic stability of these regions. In contrast<strong> repeats and intergeneic regions</strong> loose their methylation levels in cancer cells, which results in increased genomic instability.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">One of the  global epigenetic changes in cancer is the loss of gene imprinting, which can potentially contribute to cancer development. A notable example is the H19/lgf2 cluster which undergoes gene imprinting in mammals.<br /><br />In normal somatic cells the  H19 region is not methylated on the maternal allele. This results in the expression of H19 gene and subsequently production of CTCF protein which binds the enhancers that could also activate the expression of the Igf2. Therefore Igf2 is not expressed on the maternal allele.  On the paternal allele H19 region is heavily methylated, thus nothing disrupts the enhancers and they activate the  transcription of Igf2 gene. In result the gene is expressed on the paternal allele. <br /><br />In Wilm's tumour H19 and CTCF regions are also methylated on the maternal allele which results in loss of imprinting i.e. Igf2 is expressed both from maternal and paternal allele. The increased amount of Igf2 might stimulate the tumor growth and prevent apoptosis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Decitabine belongs to the DNMT inhibitors group. By binding to DNMT it enables the demethylation of DNA with every new mitotic cell division.<br />Possible effect of the drug might be related to the the decrease of the methylation in the CpG-islands of onco-supressors. The demethylation could reactivate their expression and thus potentiate tumor growth supperession.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation altering drugs can potentially change can the methylation level every cell of the organism. In case of DNMT inhibitors the methylation levels drop with every cell division. This might not be so critical for adults, but for younger patients it is dangerous because of a sensitive period of the premordial germ cell development. During this period active epigenetic reprogramming occurs. It was shown that disrupting the epigenetic state of germ cells and in particular methylation levels during the sensitive period might result in infertility and even have fatal effects.</div>
