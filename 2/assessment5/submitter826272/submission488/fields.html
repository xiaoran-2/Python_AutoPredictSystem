    <div class="field-value">Under normal conditions, DNA methylation at CpG sites is ubiquous throughout the genome. However, CpG islands remain mostly unmethylated in differentiated tissues and also during development. The very opposite happens in a an organism with cancer. The epigenome of cancer is marked by <b>genome-wide hypomethylation</b> and site-specific <b>CpG island promoter hypermethylation</b>. Therefore, silencing the underlying genes, which might be important tumor suppressor genes, and so, leading to tumor initiation. DNA hypermethylation can also indirectly silence additional classes of genes by silencing transcription factors (e.g. RUNX3 in esophageal cancer) and DNA repair genes (e.g. BRCA1). Considering all this, it has been found that there are “CpG island methylator phenotype” (CIMP) correlated to several specific types of cancer. Concluding, is no wonder indeed that DNA methylation is considered one of the 2 hits in Kudons' Hypothesis.<br />The contrary is true for DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. These are normally methylated throughout the genome, but end up being hypomethylated during cancer. This disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability, through many different ways (e.g. illegitimate recombination of repeats, activation of repeats or surrounding genes). Together, these factors have been demonstrated as important early (but, also progress with time) contributors for cancer, both in mouse models, and in genome-wide studies of humans. Therefore hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is a common event in cancers, and non-specific of any particular type of cancer.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">While epigenetics plays a role in maintaining our tissues and also during development, it is difficult to alter once 
we are adults. However, thanks to recent advances in therapeutics, the epimutations are now reversible, and are far easier to reverse than mutations affecting the genetic code. These new treatments work, because DNA methylation is mitotically inherited i.e. the epigenetic marks are maintained through mitosis, thus daughter cells express the same genes as the parental cells, which enables DNA methylation to have enduring effects on the epigenome.<br />However we should be aware that there are some problematics associated with such treatments, and we should avoid to treat young patients with such drugs, because of the epigenetic sensitive periods. A sensitive period is a period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals, and when occurs epigenetic reprogramming: the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. Since we don't even fully understand the effects on germ cells yet, it would be highly inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19 and Igf2, belong to the same cluster of imprinted genes and are 
regulated by Icr1, Dmr2 and H19 promoter elements, and play a major role in determining the size of the placenta, uptake of nutrients by the embryo, and it's weight at birth. According to  genetic  conflict  theory the male always wants most energy to his descendents, while the mother will keep the overall offspring size low. Therefore gender-specific epimutations are expected for the H19/Igf2 cluster.<br />The methylation pattern of the paternal allele prevents CTCF binding and thus activates Igf2. On the contrary, we have transcriptional silencing of the maternal Igf2, resulting from CTCF insulating Igf2 from downstream enhancers. The  interaction  between paternally and maternally derived
 Igf2 has been called “the war of the genomes".<br />Loss of imprinting of Igf2 and H19 is the most common epigenetic alteration associated with Wilm's tumor. This can lead to cancer, but other factors happening at the H19/Igf2 cluster can be responsible for cancer besides epigenetic disruption for loss of imprinting. These are uniparental disomy (i.e. two copies of parental chromosome), overdose of Igf2, and genetic mutation (e.g. deletion) causing loss of imprinting.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a FDA approved drug that belongs to DNA-demethylating agent class of epigenetic inhibitors (i.e. DNMTi), actually sold in the market for the purpose of treating myelodysplastic syndromes that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia.<br />Decitabine acts by getting incorporated on the DNA during replication, irreversibly binding DNMTs. Thus, it is a mitosis-dependent event relying on the epigenetics of DNA methylation.<br />If acting on the range which causes DNA demethylation, decitabine can have a good anti-tumour effect. Therefore, therapies focusing on the epigenome can have an anti-neoplaisc effect by stopping cancer growing instead of killing it cells.<br /><br /><br /></div>
