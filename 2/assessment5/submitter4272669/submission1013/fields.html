    <div class="field-value">Normally, cancer cells present genome-wide hypomethylation. However, CpG islands near tumor suppressing genes are hypermethylated. CpG islands are located near the promoter regions of genes an their function is to control gene expression. In cancer, CpG islands become heavily methylated causing suppression of tumor suppressing genes. Since the function of these tumor suppressing genes or growth control genes is to control cellular growth, once these genes are suppressed the cell starts growing out of control very rapidly, allowing for the apparition of tumors. As I mentioned before not only are CpG islands are aberrantly methylated in cancer. The methylation patterns of other regions such as intergenic regions and repetitive elements are also altered in cancerous cells. Usually, these regions are heavily methylated in normal cells allowing for genomic stability. Methylation of these regions prevents illegitimate recombination and transposition of repetitive elements throughout the genome. In cancerous cells, both intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated, which causes genomic instability. This genomic instability can lead to recombination or transpositions causing deletions, translocation and insertions in the chromosomes. If for example, one of these deletions leads to the mutation of tumor suppressing genes or the activation of oncogenes the disruption in DNA methylation at these specific sites can contribute to cancer. In fact, some types of cancer depend primarily in this genomic instability to occur. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster the Imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele. This methylation prevents CTCF from binding to the ICR and thus, the enhancers downstream of the ICR can act on the promoter of Igf2 activating its expression. On the other hand, the ICR if not methylated on the maternal allele, which allows CTCF to bind to the ICR. When this happens, expression of Igf2 is suppressed and the enhancers act on the promoter of H19 activating its expression. In Wilm's Tumor the maternal allele becomes methylated, causing Igf2 to be expressed both from the paternal and the maternal allele. Since Igf2 is a growth promoting factor, doubling the dosage of these gene on a cell can lead to abnormal growth and the apparition of tumors and cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent., which means that it can actively remove epigenetic methylation marks on the DNA. Since a one the main epigenetic characteristics of cancerous cells is the hypermethylation of CpG islands causing the silencing of tumor suppressing genes, using drugs that can actively demethylate DNA could have an anti-tumor effect. Removing these epigenetic marks would cause the tumor suppressing genes to be expressed again and therefore, could have an effect in reducing cell growth and tumorgenesis. Moreover, taking into account that the active removal of these epigenetic marks is mitotically inheritable the re-activation of these tumor suppressing genes would be passed down to daughter cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation marks are mitotically heritable and are therefore preserved in the epigenome in cell division. Once a new strand of DNA is created after replication there are DNA methyltransferases, such as Dnmt1, that recognise hemimethylated DNA strands and methylate the complementary strand. Through this mechanism epigenetic methylation marks can be passed down a cell line. However, there are periods of heavy epigenetic remodelling where almost all DNA methylation marks are removed and only imprinted marks are maintained. These periods are known as sensitive periods. There are two major sensitive periods during development. The first one is primordial germ cell development, where spermatogenesis and oogenesis take place, and the second one is the pre-implantation period. Treating patients during sensitive period with epigenetic drugs would not be advisable, because the target of these drugs is to establish or remove specific epigenetic marks. However, during sensitive periods almost every epigenetic mark can be actively modified, which means that even if the drug is successful in accomplishing its purpose that epigenetic state could easily be removed again. For this reason, is better to use this type of drugs during epigenetic stable periods where new epigenetic marks will be maintained. </div>
