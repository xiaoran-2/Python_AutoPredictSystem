    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, the CpG island is hypomethylated (methylation is not seen) and DNA methylation is seen at the repitive elements, intergenic region, and the introns of genes. In comparison to a cancer cell DNA methylation is the opposite, the CpG island is more likely to be methylated and the repitive elements, intergenic region, and introns are hypomethylated. DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation to silence tumor suppressor genes in cancer. CpG island hypermethylation and the associated gene silencing occur frequently in tumors and DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Epimutations are rapidly selected, less likely to die, and will divide more rapidly. DNA methylation is considered as a "hit" to DNA and cancer is the results of multiple hits to DNA. As cancer progresses, over time one will have increased methylation at CpG islands.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The maternal allele is unmethylated. The paternal allele is methylated so it is paternally imprinted. The imprint control region (ICR) on the maternal allele is bound by CTCF, which is an insulator protein and insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers on the maternal allele. So the downstream enhancers act on H19 instead of Igf2 (since it is blocked by CTCF) and enhance H19 expression on the maternal allele (by chromatin looping). On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and the downstream enhancers act on and enhance the expression of Igf2. ICRs have different modes of action, which control parent-of-origin expression at the imprinted cluster. The Disruption of Igf2 can be caused by mutation or deletion which will yield loss of imprinting (epigenetic disruption). Loss of imprinting and loss of methylation at ICRs is a common feature of cancer. Also upregulation of Igf2 (and no promotion of cdkn1c) can contribute to cancer by wrong growth promotion. Loss of Cdkn1c and an overdose of Igf2 can result in a tumour in the kidney (Wilm's tumour) as well as fetal and post-natal overgrowth. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent and hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Therefore, it is in the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. Decitabine works by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  Demethylation restores normal function to the tumor suppressor genes, which allows control over cell growth. By controlling cell growth, Decitabine can suppress tumors. <span>Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation <i>in vitro</i> and does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. </span><p><br /></p><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can initiate or sustain epigenetic change. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. After the changes are erased, they do not return. So epigenetic therapies might effect changes which stop a cancer from growing without having to kill all its cells, yielding a lasting effect. A sensitive period is when<span> particular cell types or organs are developing and establishing their epigenetic marks., For example, germ cell development and early embryonic development are sensitive periods. Treatment would be inadvisable during sensitive periods because it can cause a disruption in epigenetic reprogramming. This can effect the way an embryo is handled, causing altered maternal effect proteins due to the oocyte harvest, and possible erosion of DNA methylation imprints in early development.   <br /><br /></span></div>
