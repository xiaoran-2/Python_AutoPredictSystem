    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Most CpG islands located near the Promotor are normally not methylated, and allow the downstream genes expressed.  In cancer, hypermethylation are found at the CpG islands.  When the CpG islands are methylated it prevent area from binding with transcription factors and not allow the downstream gene to be expressed.  This silences the gene.     </p><p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated. This might function to maintain genomic integrity by preventing transposition, transcriptional interference, and illegitimate recombinations.  In cancer many of these DNA areas became unmethylated. This has the effect of turning on many DNA areas for expression that normally not expressed.<span class="_wysihtml5-temp-placeholder"></span><br /></p><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal H19 allele is not expressed due to CpG DNA methylation that silences the gene.  IGF2 is expressed in the absence of H19 via enhancers access.  </p><p>The maternal H19 allele is expressed since ICR is unmethylated and CTCF binds at ICR. IGF2 is not expressed since enhancers can not access IGF2 site. </p><p>In Wilm’s tumour both the paternal and maternal H19 alleles are not expressed due to DNA hypermethylation that silences the gene. This leads to Igf2 overexpression.</p><p>Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can contributes to cancer. Generally, alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs ,hypo or hyper, methylation, can lead to loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. Decitabine inhibits DNMT and therefore it decreases DNA methylation. This drug seems to have better anti-tumor effects at low dosage and less anti-tumor but more toxic effects at high dosage.<span class="_wysihtml5-temp-placeholder"></span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because the DNA methylation pattern are heritable. They will be in the daughter cells. </p><p>Sensitive periods are when epigenetic marks are being cleared and reset between generations. This occurs during periods of development: Pre-implantation period and primordial germ cell development. </p><p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it could cause unsccessful or unintended clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks.<br /></p></div>
