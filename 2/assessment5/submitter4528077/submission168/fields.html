    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation of CpG islands typically silences nearby genes. The DNA is methylated on the cytosine bases. The methylated cytosine binds with repressive proteins such as MeCP1/2 and recruits additional factors that condense the surrounding chromatin structure making it less available for translation. DNA methylation can be considered "epigenetic" because it is mitotically heritable through the action of DNMT enzyme that methylates the new strand of DNA each time the DNA is copied during cell division.<br /><br />In a wide variety of cancers there is unusually high methylation at some CpG islands (e.g. in breast cancer, retinoblastoma and colorectal cancer). This appears to silence some important tumour suppressor genes and is one factor that may allow a cancer cell to reproduce inappropriately. The action of DNMT enzyme then passes these patterns of methylation on to the next generation of cells potentially triggering a chain reaction of cancerous growth. Drugs such as Decitabine and Vidaza slow this down by inhibiting the action of DNMT enzyme.<br /><br />DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is believed to be associated with maintaining the structural stability of the genome. The methylation in intergenic regions appears to limit  deletions, insertions and duplications. The methylation of repetitive elements appears to reduce copying and splicing. Together these limit the emergence of damaging mutations in the DNA.<br /><br />In cancer cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are often hypomethylated. It appears that the resulting genomic instability may lead to genetic mutations and inappropriate gene expression associated with cancer. There is laboratory evidence as forced demethylation in mice can indeed trigger cancerous growth.<br /><br />In summary both CpG island hypermethylation and Intergenic/repetitive hypomethylation may be triggers for inappropriate cell division. These cancerous patterns of hypermethylation and hypomethylation can be useful biomarkers in detecting and identifying different types and stages of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Most gene activity involves equal expression of both alleles (ignoring the asymmetry of X-inactivation). However some genes are differently expressed on our maternal and paternal alleles. DNA methylation of Imprint Control Regions (ICRs) during gametogenesis can lead to both over or under-expression in the ICR's associated gene cluster.<br /><br />Many imprinted genes are associated with growth perhaps because the paternal and maternal alleles have "different agendas". The paternal allele favours growth and a large baby. The maternal allele limits this to protect the mother's health and ability to reproduce again. Given this link with growth it is not surprising cancer cells often display abnormal imprinting patterns.<br /><br />One example is the H19/lgf2 cluster on human chromosome 11. The ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated. It binds with CTCF insulator protein resulting in expression of H19 with the knock on effect through nearby enhancers that lgf2 is not expressed. In contrast the paternal allele's ICR and H19 promotor are methylated allowing the enhancers to express lgf2. <br /><br />This asymmetry is lost in Wilm's tumour as both alleles are methylated and the over-expression of lgf2 contributes to inappropriate cell division. A similar pattern seen in Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome results in foetal and postnatal overgrowth.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Hypermethylation of CpG islands is found in many cancers and appears to silence important tumour suppressor genes. Decitabine is a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMI). The primary action of Decitabine on cancer cells is to inhibit methylation of the new haploid DNA strand produced during mitotic cell division so the methylation dilutes away with each cell generation (in the same way as methylation is diluted in maternal alleles as the blastocyst develops). Blocking the inheritance of this cancerous methylation can stop the chain reaction of reproduction that is cancer.<br /><br />Cancer cells tend to exhibit not one but many epigenetic (and genetic) abnormalities. This may be evidence of an elaborate fail-safe mechanism to protect each cell from inappropriate reproduction. In view of this, Decitabine may prove more effective if used in a coordinated attack with other drugs like histone deacetylase inhibitors. Vidaza, a DNMI similar to Decitabine,is currently being tested in this way.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic markers such as DNA methylation and histone acetylisation are important in controlling which genes are expressed in a cell. This is essential to cell specialisation. Gene expression in a liver cell is very different from that in a blood cell although the overall genome is identical. <br /><br />These epigenetic markers can have an enduring effect on the genome because they are mitotically heritable. For example, in the case of DNA methylation this is achieved through the action of DNA-methyltransferase that copies the methylation of each parent strand of DNA to all new haploid copies of the DNA that is produced during cell replication. So the "parent" DNA methylation is passed on to daughter strands.<br /><p>In cancer cells, epigenetic drugs can be used to suppress inappropriate cancerous epigenetic abnormalities. But clearly there is a risk that they may disrupt normal development. In particular, they could block the epigenetic markers laid down during the early development phase from blastocyst to
epiblast (when cell specialisation is at a peak) and
during PGC development when ICRs imprinting occurs. These two periods of intense epigenetic development are called "sensitive" periods when epigenetic drug treatment would be inadvisable as the risk of side effects is high.</p></div>
