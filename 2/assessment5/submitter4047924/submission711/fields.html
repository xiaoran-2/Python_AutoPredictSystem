    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">    The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to down-regulate the expression of a gene because CpG islands are located in the promoter of a gene. However, in cancer, locus specific DNA hypermethylation usually takes place, especially hypermethylation of tumor suppresspr genes. So when hypermethylated, expression of tumor suppressor genes is down-regulated, and cells undergo rapid proliferation.<br />    DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to stablize the genome, and prevent repetitive elements "moving around" in the genome, mutating the proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. In general,  intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancer tissue. So when hypomethylated, genome in cancer cells is unstable, and cancer is more likely to happen.<br />    <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">    In paternal allele, <em>ICR </em>and promoter of <em>H19</em> are methylated, so CTCF cannot bind ICR and enhancers downstream of <em>H19 </em>up-regulate the expression of<em> Igf2</em>. In contrast,<em> ICR</em><em> </em>and promoter of<em> H19</em><em> </em>in maternal allele are hypomethylated, so CTCF bind to ICR and insulate the regulation of enhancers to <em>Igf2</em>. So the expression of<em> Igf2</em> in maternal allel is down-regulated.<br />    Inprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster causes the hypermethylation of<em> ICR</em> and <em>H19</em>, so expression of <em>Igf2</em> leads to the does of protein Igf2 twice of that in normal cells. Because Igf2 is tumor growth-promoting, disruption at the H19/Igf2 probably leads to Wilm's tumor.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">    Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA-demethylating agents. In general, CpG islands of promoters in cancer cells are usually hypermethylated, thus down-regulating the underlying genes (usually tumor suppressor genes). Decitabine can demethylate promoter CpG islands in cancer cells, and lead to higher levels of expression of tumor suppressor genes. So Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">    Changes in DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable. So patterns of methylation in daughter cells are nearly the same as their progenitor cells. <br />    A sensitive period is a period in which changes in genetic or epigenetic information have a lasting effect on the organisms. In this case, sensitice periods in development are germ cell development and pre-implantation development. It is no good treating patients during sensitive periods because patients are more susceptible to factors that lead to changes in genetic or epigenetic information, and this kind of changes is mitotically inheritable. If treated inappropriately, patients are more likely to suffer from cancer in later life.<br /></div>
