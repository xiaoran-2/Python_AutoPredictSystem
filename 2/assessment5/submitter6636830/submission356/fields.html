    <h1>Submission 356 from Anon (session_user_id: 37b5c4e57f019dbc409929a0a94393560a5e0349)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation, either locus specific hypermethylation or genome wide hypomethylation, may cause aberrations in epigenetic control seen in cancer.  In normal cells, CpG islands are not methylated and are gen promoters.  In cancer cells CpG islands are hypermethylated and silence tumour suppressors genes.  DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells and no products are expressed, but in cancer cells they are not methylated and some products are formed from repetitive elements. In Clinic, CpG islands are used as a good biomarker to identify specific tumours.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On paternal allele, histone H19 is  methylated so enhancers allow epression of Igf2.  On maternal allele histone H19 is not methylated and Igf2 is not expressedI.  If hypermethylation takes place in both alleles, imprinting is disrupted at the IH19/Igf2 cluster, since there is an overexpression of growth promoting genes.  This is the case of Wilm´s toumor in which toumors are formed in childrens kidneys.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug that affects epigenetic processes.  It is a DNA demethylated agent.  In some tumours this drugs decreases the levels of hypermethylation.  The use of Decitabine drug  along with a histone deacetylase inhibitor,  decrease  solid tumours.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic drugs have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic changes are transmitted to daughter cells by mitosis.  A sensitive period is a stage where epigenetic marks and epigenetic reprogramming are taken place, like in early development and development of germinal cells.  Therefore is not advisable to treat pregnant women nor youngsters.</div>
