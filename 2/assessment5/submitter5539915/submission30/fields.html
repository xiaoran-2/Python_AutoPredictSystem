    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Usually DNA methelation inhibits gene expression. CpG islands are dense in 60% of promotors, under normal status they are free of methylation. CpG island methylation is associated with  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/?report=printable#bib3"></a>X inactivation. Female has two X chromosomes, one of them is inactivated, this is due to the methylation of CpG island in this chromosome.<br /> CpG island is hypermethylated in cancer, this will lock the gene in an inactive state, silence the downstream tumor suppressor genes, and leads to genome-wide hypomethylation and genomic instability, all of them contributes to cancer development. <br />Normally intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated, it maintains genome integrity, prevents transpositon and recombination of genes. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, this will induce genome instability, such as gene translocation, thus make cancer occur.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, ICR is methylated, the insulator protein CTCF can not bind on it, so the enhancer can act of Igf2 gene and cause expression of Igf2.<br />In the maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated, so CTCF binds on it and block the action of enhancer on Igf2 gene. The enhancer induce expression of H19, Igf2 is not expressed.<br />In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele is hypermethylated, so Igf2 is overexpressed.<br />Disruption of imprinting at H19/Igf2 leads to upregulation of Igf2, which is an oncogene and growth promoting, and loss of Cdkn1c gene, which is a tumor suppressor. The abnormal gene expression contributes to cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. This medicine incorporates into DNA, depletes DNA methyltransferase, and induces DNA hypomethylation. <br />There are two mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor effect of decitabine. At low doses it induces DNA hypomethylation, thus reactive gene expression which is hypermethylated and suppressed in cancer. These genes are important for cell differentiation, and reduce proliferation, and/or increase apoptosis. At high doses, decitabine inhibitor DNA synthesis and lead to cytotoxicity.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a hallmark of epigenetics. It controls different epigenetic  phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of  heterochromatin. Cancer is  defined by a variety of epigenetic changes and genetic mutations. In early stage of cancer, DNA methylation is abnormal thus tumor suppression gene is inactiveted while oncogene is activated, leading to the development of cancer. <br />Reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during sensitve period. The first sensitive period is from primordial germ cell development to gametes, the second sensitive period is preimplantation and early post-implantation period. These periods have active epigenetic remodelling as well as gene expression, it's most sensitive to environment factors such as diet, medicine and chemicals, so treating patients during sensitive periods should be avoided.</div>
