    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Modifications in DNA methylation include genome-wide
hypomethylation and hypermethylation in specific sites (locus).  CpG islands found in promoters are not
methylated in normal cells. In cancer cells, promoter CpG islands become
hypermethylated, causing the silencing of the tumor suppressor genes and
misregulation of the cell cycle and DNA repair machinery, leading to genomic
instability. In the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements usually
are methylated in normal cells and become hypomethylated in cancer cells. This modification
also cause genomic instability due to illegitimate recombination between
repetitions, activation of repetitions and transposition, activation of cryptic
promoters and interruption of neighboring genes.</span></p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>At the H19/Igf2
cluster the paternal allele is methylated on the ICR, which blocks the CTCF
ligation (isolator protein) to the ICR. Without CTCF, the methylation spread to
H19 promoter silencing it. This will allow the activators to induce Igf2
expression. The maternal allele is not methylated on the ICR, which allows the
CTCF ligation (isolator protein) on this region. This will result in blocking
of activators activity on Igf2 and redirect their action on the H19, inducing
expression. In Wilm´s tumor, the maternal allele is hypermethylated at the ICR.
This will make the maternal allele behave like the paternal allele, resulting
in overexpression of Igf2. Disrupted imprinting in the H19/Igf2 cluster can
lead to lack of expression of genes that restrict growing or overexpression of
genes that promote growing, affecting the normal pattern of cell proliferation,
predisposing to embrionary/childhood tumor development. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a methylation
inhibitor, acting through DNA methyltransferase (<span>DNMT1) inhibition.
Its administration leads to a diminished hypermethylation on tumor suppressor genes,
avoiding gene silencing, controlling cell cycle and death, and allowing DNA
repair machinery to work. <span> </span></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methylation is mitotically
heritable, modifications at these epigenetic marks can be inherited at the derived
cells. So, drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects. Sensitive
periods occur during the establishment of epigenetic marks. These periods are
the early development (until blastocyst) and the primordial cell development. Treating
patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it can lead to
altered establishment of epigenetic marks that can be lifelong persistent.</p><span>
