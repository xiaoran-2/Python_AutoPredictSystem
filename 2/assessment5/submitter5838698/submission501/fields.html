    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are sites located near to the <i>promoter regions </i>of certain genes (housekeeping genes)of the mammalian genome.They are rich in Citosine Guanine nucleotides,they are involved in expression or silencing depending on whether they are methylated or not.<br />Usually CpG islands are mostly <i>unmethylated.</i>When methylation occurs gene expression is <i>silenced</i>.<br />The silencing of<i> tumour expression</i> genes is found in cancer. In different types of cancer different  sets of CpG islands are methylated .Because methylation of CpG islands is <i>mitotically heritable</i>,the silencing of tumour suppressor genes is passed on to daughter cells so thus perpetuation of silencing occurs.<br />This process fortunately is <i>reversible</i>,thus providing a weapon by which cancer could be controlled by hypomethylating agents ie. decitabine, azacytidine.<br />Methylation of CpGs is progressively found with aging suggesting some "hidden" cancers could be cause of morbidity during this period of life.<br />Normally intergenic regions and repetitive elements are<i> methylated.</i><br />Hypomethylation in these regions is found in cancer<i> genome- wide</i> (expressed throghout the genome) This is found in the repeated elements and insertions.varying depending on each cancer subtype.<br />It produces genomic instability The latter occurs by allowing illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption <em></em><em></em>of neighbouring genes,all of which are found in cancer<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells the imprinting control region( ICR )on paternal allele is methylated, so it is <i>silenced,(</i>the enhancers which lie  downstream are unable to insulate Igf2 whose expression promotes cell growth)<br />.In maternal allele the ICR is <em>unmethylated</em>, because of the binding of CTCF which blocks  methylation by binding to this region, thus the enhancers cannot act on Igfs which is then silenced. This inhibits cell growth.<br />This process of expression and silencing occurs during early development, and when altered it produces malformations or cancer.<br />In Wilms tumour ( kydney tumour found in children the maternal allele is methylated at the ICR region thus Igfs is expressed on the maternal allele (abnormal) and on the paternal allele (normal)<br />This overexpression of Igfs produces cell growth stimulus.<br /><i><br /><b></b></i></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylating drug , it inhibits EZH2 and DNMT1 ,and 3  (which attatch methyl groups to histone,proteins.EZH2 is part of a PCR2 (polycomb repressive complex and possesses HMTase activity which methylates H3 on Lysine 27 it was recently shown that EZH2 interacts with Dmnt1 (target of decitabine)<br />In various cancers EZH2 is mutated and thus , overactive inducing hypermethylation of histones silencing thetumour suppressor genes .<br /> The administration of decitabine to a patient reduces hypermethylation by blocking DMNT1<br />thus tumour suppressor genes are expressed.<br />Decitabine also reduces cell proliferation without affecting normal cells(antitumour effect)<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes are mitotically hereditable until they are actively erased , once erased they do not return( they last throughout the individual´s lifetime)<br />These epigenetic marks are .laid down during critical periods of embryonic development by means of methylation and demethylation processes.<br />Two sensible periods of development are the lapse between fertilization and epiblast formation and the forming of primodial germ cells,<br />The administration of decitabine (demethylating drug) during these periods is not advisable, because it might alter embryonic development, and produce malformations and/or cancer. Eg Wilms tumour kydney chilhood malignant tumour)<br />There is also a postnatal period especially women because the full development of mature oocites is not attained until puberty, thus administration of these hypomethylating agents might alter the maturation of oocites.<br /><br /></div>
