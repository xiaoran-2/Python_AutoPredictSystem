    <h1>Submission 480 from Anon (session_user_id: 21676710140c242ea93f1fda298c4639bcbcfc7c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents. These are small molecule inhibitors that can come in and bind very specifically to epigenetic modifiers and inhibit their function. This drug belongs to the DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors) class of inhibitors.<br /></span><span>This drug is nucleoside analogue, meaning that it irreversibly binds DNMTs after they are incorporated into the DNA upon replication. So, when the DNMT1 comes along to bind to the nucleotide and then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. <br /></span>Cancer cells which are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body will be more severely affected. This drug has very good anti-neoplastic effect killing the tumor cells (in far, far low doses).<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Drugs that alter the DNA methylation result in a more permanent solution against cancer as epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and grand-daughter cells until they are actively erased, and then, they do not return. Thus, epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.<br /></span><span>However there are sensitive periods in the human development when changes in the environment are going to have the biggest effect. <br /></span><span>The first sensitive period of development is during germ cell development and the second during early development of the embryo.<br /></span><span>These are very sensitive periods for epigenetic reprogramming, because the imprinted genes need to be reprogrammed properly during the germ cell development and then maintain their level of DNA methylation at the early development. So, altering DNA methylation during these periods would be critical for the patients’ lives and offsprings.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, there is hypomethylation at CpG islands, while other areas of the gene (introns, intergenetic region and repetitive elements) are hypermethylated. </p><p>However, in the cancer cell, it’s exactly the opposite; the CpG islands are hypermethylated and the other areas hypomethylated.<br /></p><span></span><p>Methylation, targeted at CpG islands, is an important part of the mechanisms that govern X-chromosome inactivation; it is also essential for the maintenance of imprinted genes and, at least in some cases, is critical in determining the cell-type-specific expression patterns of genes. This DNA methylation at CpG islands is a way of silencing tumour suppressor genes, thus allowing cancer cells to develop and increase in number.<br /></p><p>DNA methylation at intergenic intervals and their repetitive elements is probably there in order to maintain genomic integrity. Without the appropriate methylation of these areas, cells exhibit genomic instability and in some cases, some silencing of expression (silencing of a cryptic splicesite).<br /></p><p></p><p>In cancer, these intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated, which means that as a whole in the genome there is hypermethylation.</p><p>This disruption of DNA methylation increases genomic instability, thus allowing illegitimate deletions, insertions or, reciprocal translocations, and even duplication of chromosomes, contributing to cancer.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>In the normal cell, the paternal allele has the ICR methylated, so the enhancers will act on the Igf2, and it will be expressed. <br /></span><span>In the normal cell, the maternal allele has the ICR is unmethylated, so the enhancers will act on the H19, and it will be expressed. Therefore, Igf2 will not be expressed.<br /></span>In Wilm’s tumour, both the paternal and maternal alleles have the ICR methylated (resulting in <i>IGF2 </i>activation and <i>H19</i> silencing), so there is biallelic expression of Igf2, meaning a double dose of Igf2.<br />H19 acts in normal cells as a tumour suppressor. So, when it's silenced, the development of tumour is allowed. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene which is responsible for somatic overgrowth, thus enhancing the development of tumour.<br /></div>
