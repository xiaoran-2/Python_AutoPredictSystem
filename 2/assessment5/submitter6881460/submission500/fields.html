    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpG islands are citosine-phosphate-guanine regions in
the DNA sequence. CpG islands are located in promotor regions of genes, which
stimulate the transcription of specific genes.  By binding a methyl group to a cytosine base
in a CpG island, the gene is no longer available for transcription. Let us call
this gene: Q. By methylating the CpG Island gene Q is indirectly switched off. The
mechanism of methylation of CpG islands is mitotically heritable from parent
cell to the next generation (daughter) cells, resulting in tissue, where in
this case this specific gene Q is not expressed. </span></p>

<p>When for some reason the CpG island in the promotor
region of gene Q is switched on (demethylated), gene Q is suddenly available
for transcription. As this availability is also mitotically heritable, a new
tissue grows, having gene Q expressed in each daughter cell. If gene Q is an
oncogene, the new tissue is cancer tissue.</p>

<p><span>In intergenic regions are strings of non coding DNA.
Non coding DNA do not encode proteins but controle other sequences of DNA
nearby. In some cases these sequences occur in a repetitive way, called
repetitive elements. By methylation, the non coding DNA is analogous to the
mechanism of CpG islands, switched off. But contrary to the mechanism of CpG
islands, the sequences of DNA nearby for instance repetitive elements, are available
for encoding proteins, as there is no controle from the non coding DNA. <br />
Repetitive DNA is normally silenced by the methylation of the non coding DNA. When
the methylation is disrupted, the repetitive DNA is now available for
transcription. This overactivity of repeats can result in abarrent amounts of
proteins produced, and growth of cancer tissue.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In
chromosomes, one allele comes from the mother and one from the father. Both
alleles contain similar genetic information but different epigenetic marks, where
one of the alleles is expressed, the other silenced. Imprinting is controlled
by ICRs (imprint control regions) in mechanisms of DNA methylation. In general
epigenetic imprintings are removed by demethylation in primordial germ cells,
followed by the resetting of the female specific marks, if the embryo is a
female, or the male specific marks, if it is a male. In the H19/Igf2 cluster
the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated sothat the insulator protein CTCF
cannot bind to the ICR. Methylation is also spread to the H19 gene and the
lncRNA H19 cannot be produced. This results in downstream enhancers having free
acces to the Igf2 gene, which is being expressed. In the maternal allele the
ICR is not methylated nor is the H19 gene and CTCF can bind to the ICR. This
insulates the Igf2 gene, being silenced while lncRNA H19 is being produced. When
the ICR on the maternal allele is methylated too, we have two alleles behaving
like paternal alleles and Igf2 is overexpressed causing Willm’s tumour, because
Igf2 is growth promoting.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine
is an <strong>epigenetic drug</strong> that causes hypomethylation of a gene regulator BRD4.
BRD4 blocks the gene called Myc which itself is a gene promotor. Myc encodes a
protein that functions as a transcription factor and in the case of an
overactive Myc, it will be overactivating other genes, which can result in myelodysplastic syndromes. When BRD4 is
hypermethylated, Myc will not be blocked. <br />By hypomethylating BRD4 with
Decitabine, Myc will be blocked and activity of Myc promoted genes will slow
down. By mitosis with the included, altered epigenetic state by Decitabine, the
proliferation of myeloma cells is decreased.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>When an
epigenetic drug alters the DNA methylation and so changes the epigenetic marks
of  a cell, these changed marks will be mitotically
heritable. The old marks will not return.</span></p>

<p><span>As these
drugs will be active throughout the whole system, altering DNA methylation can
occur anywhere in the genome. The  use of
epigenetic drugs should be avoided in the sensitive periods in which cells will
be epigenetically marked. In case of pregnancy, epigenetic drugs may effect the
developing embryo in its sensitive period after implantation. Here the
sensitive period stands for specialisation of tissue en establishing epigenetic
somatic marks. Also the periods in which germ cells are produced, should be
regarded as sensitive periods. After all, epigenetically remarked cells by
drugs, will by mitosis produce daughter cels that  inherit these new marks, which might result
in abarrent tissue.</span></p></div>
