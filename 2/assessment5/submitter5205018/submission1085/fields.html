    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">Normally, CpGIs are hypomethylated; methylation of these regions, when it does occur, serves to silence the associated genes.  In cancer, CpGIs are hypermethylated, resulting in silencing of many genes that would normally be expressed.  If the silenced genes are tumor suppressor genes, then those gene products that normally help prevent out-of-control cell growth are no longer present in the cell.  This can lead to cancer, which is essentially improper, out-of-control growth of cells.<br /><br />Normally, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated.  This prevents these regions of the genome from being expressed.  In cancer, these areas are hypomethylated, resulting in their expression.  Consequences include the cell making products it shouldn't be making (such as growth factors that could lead to out-of-control cell growth) and genetic instability. The latter includes amplification and transposition of repetitive elements, resulting in sequences being inserted into existing functional genes (thus disrupting their function), reciprocal translocations in which pieces of non-homologous chromosomes are swapped with each other, and deletions of essential portions of genes (again, disrupting their function).  If these various alterations or losses of function serve to upregulate oncogenes (causing an overabundance of cell growth factors), downregulate tumor suppressor genes (causing an absence of factors that prevent growth), or both, then, again, the end result can be cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, the H19 gene is methylated on the paternal allele.  This prevents nearby enhancers from accessing the gene, leading to them acting instead on another nearby gene, Igf2.  As a result, the H19 protein is not produced, and the Igf2 protein is produced.  Normally, the H19 is not methylated on the maternal allele and CTCF is bound to the Igf2 gene.  Enhances are able to access the H19 gene but not the Igf2 gene.  Thus the H19 protein is produced and the Igf2 protein is not.  So normally, each cell has one allele producing H19 protein and the other producing Igf2 protein, for proper dosage.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, the H19 gene on both alleles is methylated and CTCF does not block access to the Igf2 gene on either allele.  In other words, both alleles have the epigenetic marks normally found only in the paternal allele.  Enhancers cannot access the H19 gene on either allele but can access the Igf2 gene on both.  So no H19 protein is produced and twice as much Igf2 protein as normal is produced.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor.  It inhibits DNA methyltransferase, resulting in the removal of methylation from DNA.  The drug is incorporated into DNA during DNA replication, and probably act by removing methyl groups from improperly-hypermethylated tumor suppressor genes, thus restoring function to these genes and allowing cells to resume making vital tumor suppressing proteins.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation alters gene expression; disrupting this can permanently change gene expression in an individual.  A sensitive period is a time during which epigenetic marks in the genome are cleared and reset.  For the genome as a whole, this occurs in humans during embyronic development, first at around the blastocyst stage and then again during primordial germ cell development.   Treatment of an individual with drugs that alter epigenetic marks during this time could be dangerous because the impacts could be system-wide and permanent, since all tissues have some types of epigenetic marks.<br /></div>
