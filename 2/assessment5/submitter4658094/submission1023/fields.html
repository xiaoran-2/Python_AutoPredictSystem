    <div class="field-value">The replacement of cytosine with 5-methylcytosine in certain areas of the DNA strand could lead to a methylation pattern that act as a control signal to the expression of genes or as a protective device against genomic instability. Both situations could be disrupted in a cancerous cell.<br />Methylation of CpG islands (CGIs) in promoter regions is an example of gene expression control disruption at cancer cells. The CGIs in promoters at normal cells are unmethylated, being the gene expression controlled by other mechanisms. But, in cancerous cells, these CGIs become hypermethylated, disrupting the normal control of those genes and silencing their expression. Tumor suppressor genes are amongst those genes that are silenced helping, consequently, the tumour spread.<br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are examples of protective devices against genomic instability in normal cells. Using DNMT1 to maintain DNA methylation in intergenic regions, a normal cell avoids deletions, reciprocal translations and insertions and the expression of cryptic start sytes. Also, maintaining DNA methylation in repetitive elements seems to be a strategy to defend the genome from transposable elements and the interference from strong promoters. In a cancerous cell this mechanism is broken: the demethylation of these regions causes the aforementioned genomic instability which, in turn, leads to tumour spreading.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><div><span>Genomic imprinting is mainly obtained by methylation of specific regions of DNA, the imprinting control regions (ICR). This tag sets the parent of origin of each allele, allowing the cells to control which of the alleles will be expressed as a function of parent <span>of origin.<br />The IGF2/H19 imprinted domain is an example of a cluster of imprinted genes, regulated by ICR1, DMR 2 and H19 promoter elements. In the offspring cells, the maternal allele ICR is hypomethylated or unmethylated, permitting the binding of an insulator protein (CTCF) wich blocks the access of an 3' enhancer to Igf2 and leads the enhancer to H19, activating is expression. The ICR in the paternal allele is hypermethylated in the offspring cells, blocking the access to the insulator protein CTCF to the ICR. In this way, the 3' enhancer could reach Igf2 and activates is expression, while H19 expression is silenced by methylation spreading downstream from ICR. <br />N</span></span>ormal cells  express paternal IGF2 and maternal H19 genes due to the methylation of paternal ICR and unmethylation of maternal ICR. In Wilm’s tumour the maternal cluster presents a paternal epigenotype that results in biallelic expression of Igf2, and
 H19 complete silencing, causing increased cell growth.<br /></div></div> <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug that belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents. As cancers are caused by genetic mistakes as well as epigenetic mistakes, and as some of the later are caused by DNA hypermethylation, this kind of drugs arise in the tentative to reduce to normal levels the DNA methylation.<br />This molecule is a nucleotide analogue, incorporated in the DNA during replication in place of cytidine. The difference is that it could not by methylated and, consequently, the DNA becomes demethylated, losing all metil marks. The hope of the treatment is to turn on again the tumor suppressor genes, silenced by hypermethylation. However, that could provoke the loss of normal epigenetic marks in normal cells and further health problems but, as normal cells divide more slowly, the effects could be less significative than possible the life expectancy gain.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The treatment of DNA with drugs that alter the DNA methylation pattern could have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because that kind of marks could be / is transmitted to the daughter cells during replication by mitotic heritability. The enzyme DNMT1, that uses hemimethylated DNA as a substrate, could help to transmit DNA methylation patterns during replication. In this way, the new epigenetic marks generated by the drug treatment would last the whole life of the treated lineage of cells. That marks will last until the death of the cells or until the reprogramming that occurs in sensitive stages: the epigenetic reprogramming of the germ cell line, the early development and, in a smaller extent, during cell differentiation. Treatments during the first two named sensitive stages are quite problematic due to the possibility of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through the gametes of the epigenetic modifications that arose from the treatment. In an extreme example, the treatment of a woman during the beginning of pregnancy could lead to epigenetic modifications in her sons and in her grand-sons, besides the effects on herself.<br /><br /><br /></div>
