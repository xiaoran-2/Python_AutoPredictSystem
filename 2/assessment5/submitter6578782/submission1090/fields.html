    <h1>Submission 1090 from Anon (session_user_id: 07791ef6c9165c4c23ef5f2e59817cb40b5b3cb1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase resulting to the hypomethylation of the DNA.<br /><br />Inhibition of DNA methyltransferase leads to a decreased number of methylated DNA strands (hypomethylation).<br /><br />A cancerous (tumor) cell exhibit high activities for enzymes that which are involved in the methylation of histones/DNA. DNA methylation is associated with epigenetic silencing. Tumor-suppressing genes can be epigenetically silenced through the surrounding methylated DNA. This in turn leads to the proliferation of the tumor.<br />The decreased amount of methylated DNA strands may have an anti-tumor effect. A decrease in the amount of methylated DNA surrounding the coding genes for tumor-suppression decreases the probability that the gene will be silenced. This in turn will lead to a more "active" tumor-suppresing gene which in turn "may" prevent the proliferation of tumor cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic effects of drugs are usually "carried out" during the life cycle of a cell. A certain drug that affects the genome through epigenetic processes have a lasting effect on subsequent cell generations. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a period wherein the cell is most vulnerable to outside changes. This period is usually associated during cell division.<br /><br />Treatment of patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable. During a sensitive period (i.e. cell division) the epigenetic traits that we want may not necessarily affect the cell. In addition, chemotherapy during a sensitive period may instead lead to an increase in the number of tumor cells. Chemotherapy uses targeted radiation to "destroy" tumor cells, if normal cells undergoing cell division were exposed to the radiation, the radiation can make the cells unable to stop replicating/dividing. This will produce cells that do not stop replicating which is a precursor to the formation of a tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation  serve as epigenetic silencing markers. The presence of DNA methylation at this region of the DNA causes the surounding genes to be "silenced" or have a reduced gene expression. In normal cells, CpG islands are usually free from methyl groups. The normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and in repetitive elements serve as "long range silencers" for this region. In cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated. In cancerous cells, there is an imbalance between the amount of DNA methylation. There is a loss of DNA methylation in parts of the DNA that should be methylated (hypomethylation) and an increase in the regions that should not be methylated (hypermethylation). This results in two things (1) Hypermethylated DNA strands silence genes that are associated with tumor-suppression and genes involved in apoptosis and/or DNA repair (2) Hypomethylation of DNA strands disrupts processes associated with cell pluripotency and cell differentiation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
