    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is essential  for normal development in mammals. In a
normal healthy cell CpG islands are hypomethylated in contrast with the
intergenic regions, the repetitive elements and introns which are
hypermethylated.  Cytosines in CpG
dinucleotides can be methylated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) enzymes such
as Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b to form 5-methylcytosine . Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are able to
establish a new methylation pattern to the unmethylated DNA (de novo). Unlike Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, Dnmt1 which maintains DNA
methylation, functions during DNA replication to copy the DNA methylation
pattern from the parental DNA strand onto the newly synthesized daughter
strand. CpG islands tend to be protected
from methylation and methylation of these CpG islands results in silencing of
gene expression. In cancer, the intergenic regions, repetitive elements and
introns are hypomethylated and this leads to copying errors including deletions,
insertions and reciprocal translocations.In contrast, the CpG islands acquire abnormal
hypermethylation which results in transcriptional silencing thus gene
inactivation; such as silencing of tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells that
is inherited in daughter cells following division which give rise to more tumor
cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Expression of imprinted genes is controlled by imprint control regions (ICRs). Imprint is associated with DNA methylation at ICR. The ICR at Igf2 and H19 is
normally methylated on the paternal allele. Methylation is excluded from the
maternal allele by CTCF binding.<br />In the maternal strand, the CTCF complex binds to the allele due to methylation marks which then lead to silencing of H19 as the enhancers initiate the expression of Igf2. In a normal cell there is a normal dose of H19 from the maternal strand and Igf2 from the paternal strand.Sometimes however,there can be hypermethylation at the ICR which is associated with Wilm's tumour. In such cases,the two strands will be inherited from the father and will be expressed as the paternal which means that the gene will have a double dose of Igf2 and zero dose of H19.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It inhibits DNA methylation so DNA becomes hypomethylated. Decitabine's activity is useful in treating cancers such as myelodysplatic syndrome  (Leukemia) because by the induction of hypomethylation, it is able to reactivate epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an excellent target for treatment of cancer.The reason of why DNA methylation is an excellent candidate for treatment of cancer is that it can be easily manipulated and enduring effects are ensured because DNA methyltransferase enzymes known as Dnmts preserve methyl marks during mitosis in cell division. A sensitive period is a period of time where extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs. Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because some epigenetic drugs may interfere with the normal function of DNA methylation. Such an example is of pregnant women. Pregnant women are advised not to take epigenetic drugs not only during pregnancy but even months before conception because most reprogramming occurs in early child development as well as during the formation of gametes (oocytes in female and spermatocytes in male) and taking these epigenetic drugs could result in disease or even cancer in the embryo.</div>
