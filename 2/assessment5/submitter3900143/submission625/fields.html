    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands generally remain unmethylated.  But when DNA methylation does occur at these regions, it results in the silencing of gene expression by forming a repressive chromatin structure or prohibiting transcription factor binding.  In cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated, resulting in silencing of tumor suppressor genes.  Methylation of CpG islands can effect single genes, single biomarkers, sets of genes, panels of biomarkers, and can spread to CpG island shores.  Disruption of this DNA methylation appears to suppress tumorigenesis.  <br /><br />In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the genome are typically methylated to maintain genomic integrity, for example by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or protecting the genome from transposable elements.  In cancer cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, resulting in genomic instability and activation of oncogenes.  Examples of genomic instability seen in cancers include recombination between repeats, transposition, deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations.  Disruption of this hypomethylation appears to enhance tumorigenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Typically the H19/Igf2 cluster of the paternal allele is methylated at the ICR, which blocks binding of the CTCF insulator protein.  This results in DNA methylation spreading to H19, silencing this promotor.  The downstream enhancers are then able to access Igf2, therefore activating Igf2 expression.  In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing binding of CTCF.  CTCF insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers, so Igf2 is not expressed.  Instead, the enhancers act upon H19. <br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, there is hypermethylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster ICR.  The maternal allele is methylated in the same way as the paternal allele, resulting in the inability of CTCF to bind, the downstream enhancers acting on Igf2 on both alleles, and therefore overexpression of Igf2.<br /><br />The disruption of normal imprinting at this cluster results in the overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth promoting gene.  Therefore the cells undergo uncontrolled growth, resulting in tumor formation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent.  It inhibits DNMT by irreversibly binding to it after it has been incorporated into the DNA.  It is replication dependent, so as a cancer cell undergoes mitosis under the influence of Decitabine, the daughter cells are not able to use DNMT to maintain the hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes.  It will generally target cancer cells, which replicate much more rapidly than normal cells.  As this replication occurs, the tumor suppressor genes that have been hypermethylated are no longer silenced in the daughter cells, and therefore tumor cells die.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The DNA methylation patterns in the genome are mitotically heritable, so they are passed on from the parent cell to the daughter cells during replication.  A sensitive period is a period of time in development during which epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, undergo clearing and reprogramming.  These periods are germ cell development and early embryonic development.  Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it could result in various imprinting disorders, problems with fertility, or could impact the offspring of the patients if the epigenetic alterations are transgenerationally heritable.</div>
