    <div class="field-value">The global level of methylation decreases as a normal tissue progresses to a metastatic tissue. At the same time methylation at CpG islands becomes more dense. In a normal cell a CpG island is hypomethylated while in general the genome is methylated, in the repetitive elements, through the intergenic regions and in the introns of genes. In contrast in a cancer cell the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated and the rest of the genome in general, including the repetitive elements, the intragenic region and the introns are hypomethylated. So when comparing a normal to a cancer cell, what is generally described is a swap in terms of where methylation is found. Usually in a cancer cell, the surrounding areas of a CpG island downstream and upstream (shores) are also hypermethylated. The CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. So the disruption of DNA methylation at the CpG islands leads to the inactivation of the tumor suppressors. As for the intragenic intervals and the repetitive elements, the consequence of the unmethylated status described in cancer cells, is the illegitimate recombination between repeats, the activation of repeats and translocations, and also the activation of cryptic promoters and the disruption of neighboring genes. In general the lack of methylation in those regions leads to abnormal karyotype effects such as reciprocal translocations, deletions and insertions, due to genomic instability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The disruption of the ICRs  leads to the loss of imprinting and this is a feature known to be shown in cancer cells. Genes that should be displaying mono-allelic gene expression (imprinted), no longer show this imprinting expression but rather they get expressed by both the maternal and the paternal alleles or they are silenced on both. Both hypermethylation and hypomethylation can occur. The example of Wilms tumor is a case of hypermethylation of the ICR, leading to the expression of the Igf2 factor. In more detail, the ICR which can be found on the paternal allele is methylated, while it is unmethylated on the maternal allele. When its unmethylated the CTCF binds the insulator which means that the enhancers will act on H19 but Igf2 will be silent from the maternal allele so its not expressed. On the paternal allele, since the ICR is methylated Igf2 is expressed. This is the normal case. With the loss of imprinting and the hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele, there is expression of Igf2 resulting in double quantity of Igf2 in comparison with normal cells. Other than this example loss of imprinting occurs in a wider range of tumor types.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is a drug that is approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia or AML It is a molecule which is nucleoside analog. It incorporates into the DNA upon replication and when the DNA methyltrasferase comes along to bind it, the DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransfderase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. The action of these DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent so the cell needs to replicate. Of course the cancer cells are dividing at a faster rate so they are the ones more severely affected. It has been found that using it at the right dosage, outside of the range that they case DNA demethylation, has an antineoplastic effect, actually killing the tumor cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">By altering the DNA methylation there could be some lasting results because of the fact that epigenetic mechanisms are reversible. By challenging that aspect and due to the fact that epigenetic changes are passed on during a cells division to a daughter cell and so forth, until they are actively erased, once erased, they do not return. So the suggestion is that by using epigenetic therapies there is no need to kill all of the cancer cells. This idea presented, is actually how Decitabine drug works. Since these drugs are going to be used by whole system, every cell has a potential to be affected. Those that would have to deal with more side effects would be young patients, particularly those that have developing germ cells in sensitive periods, as this sort of treatment challenges and inhibits the epiginetic machinery. Sensitive period is the post natal period and during the gametogenesis in women. It has been shown that during sensitive periods of development some experiences influence the DNA methylation pattern of several genes. These represent stable epigenetic modifications that alter gene transcription throughout the lifespan and promote behavioral outcomes. Therefore the consequences of young people would be devastating, which makes this treatment inadvisable for them.</div>
