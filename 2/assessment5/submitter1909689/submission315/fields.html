    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpG
stands for a cytosine nucleotide and a guanine nucleotide that are separated by
a phosphate. A CpG island is a region of DNA with a high proportion of CpG dinucleotides.  CpG islands often are near gene
promoters.  DNA methylation at CpG
islands silences the gene.  Almost a
thousand CpG islands are methylated in X chromosome inactivation. In a cancer
cell the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell.  Methylation of CpG islands in the promoters
of tumor suppressor genes can be one of the hits of the Knudson hypothesis,
which proposed that you must have multiple hits for cancer to occur.  CpG island hypermethylation and associated
gene silencing has been found in almost all tumors that have been studied.</span></p>

<p>I<span>n a normal cell most intergenic
intervals or repetitive elements are methylated, which helps maintain genomic
integrity. In cancer the repetitive elements and intergenic regions tend to be
hypomethylated, which leads to genomic instability. If you have hypomethylation
of repeats or intergenic intervals, then illegitimate recombinations may occur if
repeats align. Moreover, hypomethylation of a repeat lets a copy of it be
made.  That copy can jump around the
genome or transpose, which may disrupt the coding region of a gene or activate
neighboring genes. One often observes such genomic instability in cancer cells.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Because the paternal allele’s imprint
control region is methylated, the insulator protein CTCF does not bind to it,
thus allowing the enhancers to promote expression of Igf2.  </span></p>

<p>Because the maternal allele’s imprint
control region is unmethylated, the insulator protein CTCF binds to it, thus preventing
the enhancers from promoting expression of Igf2.</p>

<p><span>When imprinting is disrupted at the
H19/Igf2 cluster, both the paternal and the maternal alleles are methylated, so
CTCF does not bind to either, thus allowing the enhancers to cause expression
of IGF2 in both alleles.  T</span>his double dose
of Igf2 (compared to a normal cell) results in Wilm’s tumor because IGF2 is growth promoting.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine may be used to treat
cancer by reducing the methylation of the epigenome.  Decitabine belongs to the epigenetic inhibitor
class DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine reduces DNA methylation by i</span>nhibiting DNA methyltransferase, which <span>transfers methyl groups to DNA. By causing a tumor-suppressor gene to be
unmethylated, Decitabine can promote expression of that gene, resulting in
production of an anti-tumor protein.</span>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond treatment because the state of
methylation of a cell’s DNA is replicated in its daughter cell when it splits.  </span>

<p><span>Cell division initially produces
hemimethylated DNA in which each CpG with a
methylated C is hydrogen bonded to GpC with an unmethylated C. Dnmt1 (a </span>DNA
methyltransferase enzyme<span>) recognizes this configuration and
methylates the unmethylated C, thus fully reproducing the methylation state
of the DNA before replication.  </span></p>

<p>Altering DNA methylation can have
enduring effects on the epigenome because the state of methylation of a cell’s
DNA is replicated in its daughter cell when it splits.</p>

<p>A sensitive period is when changes in the
environment are going to have the biggest effect on epigenetic state. The sensitive periods of development are while epigenetic
reprogramming occurs: during germ cell development and early embryonic
development (pre-implantation and early post-implantation).</p>

<p><span>Treating patients during sensitive
periods would be inadvisable because the drugs could have undesirable
epigenetic effects on unintended loci during reprogramming.  E</span>xposure during a sensitive period could
cause changes to epigenetic marks that will be maintained the lifetime of the patient
because of their mitotic heritability, and perhaps affect the patient’s descendants.</p>
