    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Disruption of imprinting
contributes to cancer, because it results in the production of too much or too
little gene product that regulates growth. Normally, imprinted genes result in
monoallelic, parent-of-origin expression. With a loss of imprinting there is
either expression of two alleles or none at all. For example, loss of
imprinting by hypermethylation of an ICR in the H19/Igf2 cluster causes Wilm’s
tumor.</span></p>

<p>Here,
the ICR of the paternal allele is methylated and paternally imprinted. Heterochromatin
spreading occurs from the ICR to the promoter for H19, silencing that gene. DNA
methylation blocks insulator factor binding at the ICR, so that enhancers
downstream of H19 can act on Igf2, activating its expression. </p>

<p>The
ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated and bound by an insulator protein (CTCF).
This insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers, silencing the gene. Downstream
enhancers act on unmethylated H19, promoting its expression. </p>

<p><span>In
Wilm’s tumor, there is a loss of imprinting control as the maternal ICR is
methylated. This hypermethylation results in two active alleles for IgF2,
leading to its overexpression. Loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster thus results
in cancer, because both parental alleles express Igf2; high levels of this growth
promoter contribute to tumorigenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation generally occurs within
introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements and does not occur at CpG
islands near promoters. In cancer, there are aberrations in this pattern
including genome-wide hypomethylation and locus-specific hypermethylation at CpG
islands and ICRs.</p>

<p>CpG islands, which are found at nearly
60% of promoters, are normally unmethylated regardless of whether the promoter
is active or not. In cancer, however, the CpG islands become hypermethylated,
which always silences the gene. If hypermethylation occurs at the promoter of a
tumor suppressor gene, the gene is not expressed and thus promotes cell
proliferation. Because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, all
subsequent cells in this lineage will have the same property contributing to
tumor growth.</p>

<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions
and repetitive elements maintains genomic stability and protects against transposition.
In general, introns and repetitive elements are methylated under normal
circumstances, but these regions are hypomethylated in cancer. </p>

<p><span>Disruption of
DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements may contribute to
cancer in several ways. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions may activate
cryptic promoters and splice cites, as well as disrupt neighboring genes.
Hypomethylation in repetitive elements may activate repeats allowing their
transcription and transposition; the insertion of a repetitive element may
inappropriately activate neighboring genes or disrupt the coding region of a
gene. Also, strong promoters at long terminal repeats may become active and
cause transcriptional interference. Finally, hypomethylation allows a more open
chromosome structure making more of the DNA molecule accessible for
translocation. The consequences of these changes are a disruption of normal
gene expression and the loss of normal epigenetic control of gene expression,
allowing overexpression of growth promoting genes and oncogenes. Combined with
the silencing of tumor suppressors from hypermethylation at CpG islands, these
factors create conditions under which cancer is likely to occur.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor
(DNMTi). It is a nucleoside analog that becomes incorporated into DNA during
replication and it binds irreversibly to DNA methyltransferase. The effect is
to lower unwanted methylation over cell generations by preventing the methylation
of daughter strands when DNA replicates and cells divide. It has its most
effect on cancer cells, because it depends upon cell division and cancer cells
divide more rapidly. This drug can have an anti-tumor effect because
hypermethylation inactivates growth suppressors. Removing the excess methylation
should allow activation of tumor suppressors, stopping or slowing the growth of
tumors. In some cases, demethylation over several cell divisions can kill the cells outright. This drug can be used effectively in conjunction with other DNMTi
molecules and standard chemotherapy drugs for a combined response.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Altering DNA methylation can have an enduring effect
on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable; that is,
epigenetic marks are conserved during DNA replication. DNMT1 enzymatically adds
methyl groups to cytosines in hemi-methylated DNA produced during replication.
This is accomplished in a way that duplicates the pattern of marks on the original
strand. This process is usually carried out faithfully over the lifetime of an
individual. Consequently any therapeutic effects that alter the epigenome will
be maintained over a person’s lifespan.</span></p>

<p><span><span>Because of this heritability of methylation, it
would be advisable to avoid using these drugs during sensitive periods – </span> <span>times in the life cycle where disruptions or
changes in the epigenome will have the greatest effect and do
the most harm. For example two sensitive periods occur during periods of
epigenetic re-programming in early development and primordial germ cell development.
</span></span></p>

<p><span>It is inadvisable to treat patients including the
very young and pregnant women during sensitive periods because detrimental
changes to the epigenome can be lasting and perhaps transgenerational. Changes
in DNA methylation especially in CpG islands and ICRs may predispose someone –
as well as their children and grandchildren – to diseases such as diabetes or
cancer. </span></p></div>
