    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, the paternal allele of the H19/lgf2 cluster is imprinted, meaning it is methylated, and CTCF cannot bind to the ICR. Thus there is no insulator action and the enhancers downstream are free to act on Igf2, not H19, and promote its expression. H19 is not active on this paternal allele because of heterochromatin spreading. </p>
<p>The maternal allele is not normally imprinted, so CTCF insulator is free to bind to the ICR, which blocks the action of the enhancers on igf2, resulting in their action on the H19 gene instead. As such, lgf2 is not expressed in the maternal allele. </p>
<p>Lgf2 is a growth promoting gene, and if imprinting is disrupted (as in the case of Wilm's tumor) and the ICR of the maternal allele is also silenced, CTCF will not be able to bind and insulate the action of the enhancers. Thus they act on lgf2 and enhance its expression because it's their primary preferred location. As such, two copies, instead of 1 are expressed in the cell. This is important for the development of cancer because abnormal expression of growth factors resulting in cells proliferating at too great a rate is one of the major causes of tumors. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is that once a DNA methyltransferase enzyme like Dnmt1 lays down methylation at these specific clusters of CpGs, there is the formation of a repressive chromatin structure that inhibits transcription or any other factors from binding. This is important because it prevents inappropriate genetic expression and helps maintain genomic stability and somatic tissue identity. </p><p>In cancer, DNA methylation at CpG islands can be disrupted in many ways. At the simplest level, they can either be hypermethylated (overactive methylation) or hypomethylated (inappropriately under-methylated), and often occur early and progress with time as the tumor grows and possibly metastasizes. In the case of hypermethylation, certain genes, like tumor suppressor genes, can be inappropriately silenced, contributing to cancer. The effects of methylation can be spread out onto surrounding genes as well. In the case of hypomethylation, factors that should not be expressed become free to express, which can lead to genomic instability and thus contribute to cancer. In some cases, hypomethylation and resulting inappropriate expression of one section of the gene can lead to inappropriate action on surrounding regions, which then can also contribute to cancer through that secondary effect. </p><p>











</p><p>Examples of hypomethylation's contribution to cancer can be found in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the genome. Normally, these regions are properly methylated, which promotes genomic stability (prevents in/dels and illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes). For example, heavily methylated regions would be closed heterochromatin, inhibiting recombination. In cancer, this stability is disrupted, most commonly in the repeated regions of the genome. Heterochromatin would become euchromatin, and this can result in inappropriate recombination. This genome-wide hypomethylation is a common feature of many types of cancerous tissue, and have resulted in additional deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations that can all affect the development of cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine works against myelodysplastic syndromes, which are precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia. According to the Economist article, any lymphomas are cause by mutations that cause the methylating enzymes to become overactive. The hypermethylation resulting from these enzyme's over-action causes silencing of the genes they surround, which includes tumor-suppressor genes that prevent the formation of malignancies. </p><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating class of inhibitors, which means it's incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and when a DNA methyltransferase appears, it is bound irreversibly. So the replication-dependent incorporation means that cancer cells, which are dividing much more rapidly than other cells, will be more severely affected. Drugs like Decitabine can have an anti-tumor affect because previously silenced tumor-suppressor genes can be reactivated to prevent and slow malignancies. In this way, a DNA-demethylating agent can extend the survival period of the patient and promote better quality of life and chances at recovery. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike, DNA mutations, epigenetic modifications can be reversible. Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug development because they are incorporated upon replication and can be maintained over time. Just as DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, once these marks have been wiped, the effects can also be mitotically heritable. </p>
<p>There are sensitive periods of development where DNA methylation and clearing of epigenetic marks are occurring. Younger patients, particularly those that have developing germ cells, and pregnant women who are in early gestation are both examples of sensitive periods. <br /></p>
<p>If an agent that inhibits or otherwise alters DNA methylation were to be introduced in these sensitive periods where methylation is cleared then laid down again, there could be drastic consequences for the unborn child or the developing germ cells. In sensitive frames of time, it can result in global genomic instability and cause deleterious changes in gene expression. Treating patients who are in either of these sensitive periods with drugs that alter the epigenetic state is extremely inadvisable because of the potential for these drastic consequences. Pregnant mothers could miscarry or have abnormal births, and young women may also produce inviable or damaged eggs. </p></div>
