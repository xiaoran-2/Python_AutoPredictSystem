    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">DNA-methylation is an addition of a methyl group to the DNA at cytosines, which is done by methyltransferases. If the methylation is done at CpG islands, which are mostly found at promoters of genes, those genes are silenced. This is done by formating a repressive chromatin structure or prohibit transcription factor binding. In a normal cell, the promoter is usually not methylated, methylation increases with aging. Methylation in a normal cell occurs at repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns of genes.<br />Hypermethylation at CpG in cancer cells is to silence tumor suppressor genes and hypo methylation can activate oncogenes.<br />Methylation in repetitive elements and intergenic regions maitain genomic stability. In cancer cell there is hypomethylation - genes can be activated, can activate neighbour genes - genomic instability leads to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a DNA-demethylating agents. It demethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA-demethyltransferase.<br /><span>When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth.  When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer.</span><span><br />By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, so CTCF can't bind, enhancers are free to activate Igf2 and Igf2 is expressed - and only from the paternal allele. The methyatio is spreaded, so H19 is not expressed. On the maternal allele H19 is expressed, as CTFC is bindng to ICR, CTCF is isulating the Igf2, so enhacers are free to activate H19. That region is unmethylated. In Wilm's tumor the materna chromosme acts as paternal, with a paternal pattern of hypermethylation of H19. Igf2 turned on, H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
