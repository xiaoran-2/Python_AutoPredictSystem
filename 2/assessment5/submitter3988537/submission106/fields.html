    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation patterns in cancer show genome-wide changes. CpG islands have hypermethylation while the genome in general becomes hypomethylated. These alterations disrupt normal gene expression and promote mutations.<br /><br />Normally, CpG islands, which occur in gene promoters, are unmethylated for active genes. When these islands are methylated, the result is gene silencing. In cancer, there is increased DNA methylation at CpG islands, resulting in silencing of previously active genes, in particular tumor suppressor genes. Which CpG islands are hypermethylated does differ with cancer type. But, the inactivation of tumor suppressors eliminates essential cell functions such as cell division regulation and apoptosis, contributing to cancer development and progression.<br /><br />CpGs that occur in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated, which helps compact the chromosome in these areas and preserve genomic stability. Intergenic DNA methylation decreases transcription at cryptic splice sites and antisense transcription. It also helps direct proper RNA splicing. DNA methylation at repetitive elements silences the repeats, which prevents several potentially mutagenic processes. It works to prevent transposition of the repeats, improper chromosome recombination, and transcriptional interference with neighboring genes. <br /><br />But in cancer, these CpGs become unmethylated, which helps unpack the chromosome and promote mutagenic processes. This demethylation in intergenic regions can cause changes in splicing or activation of cryptic promoters, resulting in aberrant gene expression. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements can cause reciprocal translocations between chromosomes, deletions or insertions in chromosomes, or other genomic aberrations. These changes contribute to cancer by causing disruptions in normal gene function and further mutations that then can result in additional disruptions.<br /><br />(Answer drawn from lectures and assigned reading.)<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes in DNA methylation can cause disruption of imprinting. Alterations in imprinting can then lead to over/under expression of genes at the imprint locus. Such aberrant gene expression has been shown to be involved in cancer development. One example is Wilm’s tumor, due to hypermethylation at the H19/Igf2 cluster.<br /><br />The paternal allele at this cluster is normally methylated at the imprint control region. This methylation prevents the binding of CTCF to the insulator element, which allows the enhancers to act on Igf2, causing gene expression of Igf2, but not H19. On the other hand, the maternal allele at H19/Igf2 is unmethylated normally, which allows CTCF to bind to the insulator, causing the enhancers to act on H19. Consequently, H19 is expressed and Igf2 is not.<br /><br />In Wilm’s tumor, the imprint control region is methylated on the maternal allele. In this state, the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele: the CTCF element does not bind the insulator, and the enhancers act on the maternal Igf2, causing its improper expression. This extra expression of Igf2, a gene which encourages cell growth, contributes to the development of cancer.<br /><br />(Answer drawn from lectures and assigned reading.)<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase and is called a demethylating agent in the Economist article. Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that is incorporated into DNA during replication. When DNMT1 binds to add a methyl group to the daughter strand at one of these analogs, it remains attached and is no longer available to methylate other cytosines in the replicated DNA. The effect of Decitabine is a decrease in DNA methylation over the course of cell divisions. <br /><br />In cancer cells, CpG islands of tumor suppessor genes are hypermethylated. Because these cells are rapidly dividing, the daughter cells will have reduced DNA methylation in the presence of Decitabine. It is probable that demethylation of these islands is a way that Decitabine has an anti-tumor effect, by allowing the tumor suppressor activity of these genes to be re-established in the daughter cells.<br /><br />(Answer drawn from lectures and assigned reading.)<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA-methylation-altering drugs could cause lasting changes in tumor cells across cell divisions because DNA methylation patterns are mitotically heritable. For example, Decitabine incorporates itself into DNA strands during cell division and irreversibly binds DNMT1 so that this enzyme can no longer copy the cytosine methylations to the daughter strand. This results in a loss of methylation in daughter cells, and when these cells divide there will be no methyl groups transferred to their daughter cells’ DNA where the methylation is lost. Consequently, this lack of methylation is reproduced in the descendant cell population.<br /><br />Because of this demethylation, during sensitive periods it would be inadvisable to use epigenetic-altering medications. Sensitive periods are when normal (not cancer-related) DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks are erased and added systematically to the genome. The sensitive periods when this epigenetic reprogramming occurs are in pre-implantation and early embryonic development and in primordial germ cell development. During primordial germ cell development, genomic imprinting is another type of epigenetic reprogramming that occurs. Therefore, drugs that alter epigenic marks would disrupt epigenetic reprogramming and cause harmful, possibly lethal, effects to the embryo or germ cells. <br /><br />(Answer drawn from lectures and assigned reading.)<br /><br /><br /></div>
