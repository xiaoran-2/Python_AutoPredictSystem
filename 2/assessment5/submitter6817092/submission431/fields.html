    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark involving the covalent transfer of a methyl group to the C-5 position of the cytosine ring of DNA by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). In mammals, most DNA methylation is essential for normal development, and it plays a very important role in a number of key processes including suppression of repetitive element transcription and transposition.
DNA methylation is mediated by a family of highly related DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs), which transfer a methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine to cytosines in CpG dinucleotides. 
The methyl-cytosines established by the DNMTs serve as binding sites for the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2,... . Through interactions with histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferases, and enzymes, the MBDs translate methylated DNA into a compacted chromatin environment that is repressive for transcription.
In mammals, most CG dinucleotides are methylated on cytosine residues, whereas CG dinucleotides within promoters tend to be protected from methylation. Defects in DNA methylation are closely associated with cancer. Epigenetic hallmarks of cancer include global DNA hypomethylation and locus-specific hypermethylation of CpG islands. 
Locus-specific hypermethylation usually occurs at promoter CGIs of tumor suppressor genes, resulting in heritable transcriptional silencing. As a result, these regulatory genes are transcriptionally silenced resulting in a loss-of-function.
Hypomethylation arises mainly from loss of methylation at normally heavily methylated repeat elements, including satellites and retrotransposons, leading to genomic instability and oncogene activation.Typically, cancer cells exhibit hypomethylation of intergenic regions that normally comprise the majority of a cell's methyl-cytosine content. Consequently, transposable elements may become active and contribute to the genomic instability (deletions, insertions) observed in cancer cells. 
Thus, through the effects of both hypo- and hyper-methylation, DNA methylation significantly affects the genomic landscape of cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">People inherit one copy of genes from their mother and one from their father. For the H19/IGF2 genes, only the paternal allele of ICR, which controls the parent-specific genomic imprinting of H19/IGF2 genes, appears. Thus , the CTCF complex cannot bind to the paternal allele and this lead to a loss of H19 activity and an expression of IGF2. 
In Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, ICR1 has too many methyl groups in maternal allele. Hypermethylation leads to a loss of H19 activity and increased activity of the IGF2 like in paternal allele, which together lead to overgrowth and an increased risk of tumors.
In Russell-Silver syndrome, ICR1 has too few methyl groups in paternal allele. Hypomethylation leads to a loss of IGF2 activity and increased activity of the H19, which together lead to poor growth and short stature.
Normally, only the copy inherited from a father of IGF2 is active. In some cancers, both the paternal and the maternal copies of the gene are active, increasing the amount of IGF2. This increased amount may stimulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells. Loss of imprinting of the IGF2 gene has been identified in a cancer called Wilm's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is classified as an "antimetabolite" and a "demethylation" agent or a DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.
When there is an increase in DNA methylation this may results in the blockage of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth.  When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, promoting cancer.  
Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold. One way is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA. By this process, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. 
Decitabine also belongs to the category of antimetabolites. Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer cells, there is an increase in DNA methylation. This may results in a loss of activity of suppressor genes. That’s why, DNA methylation process seems to be a good target for treatments of cancer.  Thus, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors can act once ant the the resulting change induced is normally permanent and unidirectional. But this change can be critical during certain periods like the formation of gametes and during zygote formation. Indeed during this periods we can observe a high level of epigenetic reprogramming.</div>
