    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are usually located at gene promoters and most of them remain unmethylated to not block transcription of the genes. In cancer CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. Especially CpG islands from tumour supressor genes are frequently hypermethylated in cancer. Therefore these genes are not expressed and cannot inhibit the growth of tumour cells.<br /><br />CpGs at intergenic regions are methylated to block enzymes like RNA Pol II that would interfere with normal transcription of a gene starting from its promoter. Repetitive elements do unwanted things. When not in form of heterochromatin they can due to their similarity lead to recombination between chromosomes. When expressed, they move copy themselves to other places in the DNA. Repetitive elements are therefor normally silenced by methylation to have genomic stability.<br /><br />In cancer repetitive elements are commonly hypomethylated and disrupt the structur of other genes by the means mentioned above. By unmethylation of their strong promoters they can also lead to transcription of nearby genes. Demethylation at intergenic regions can disrupt expression of genes. Behaviour of cancer cells can be the result of these disruptions.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2-cluster has an imprint control region. On the paternal allele this ICR is methylated. Enhancers act on the Igf2 gene so Igf2 gets expressed. Additionally the methylation of the ICR spreads towards H19, so H19 is not expressend from the paternal allele. On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated. The protein CTCF binds to the IRC and blocks the enhancers. The enhancers then act on H19 instead and micro RNA from H19 is produced.<br /><br />If the maternal behaves like the paternal allele Igf2 is overexpressed. This can happen due to mutation in the ICR of the H19/Igf2-cluster or inheritance of two paternal alleles. Igf2 growth promoting gene. Additionally an the Kcnq1 cluster on same chromosome on the maternal allele the expression of Cdkn1c which is growth inhibitor can be blocked. Overexpression of Igf2 growth promoter and no expression of Cdkn1c predisposes to Wilm's tumour.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-methyltransferase-inhibitor. After cell-division DNMT1 adds methylation to CpGs at the unmethylated daughter-strand. Decitabine disrupts DNMT1 by chemically binding the DNMT1-molecule and therefore disrupts mitotic heritabilitation of DNA-methylation.<br /><br />Cancer cells tend to divide more than regular cells and therefore are more affected by Decitabine. Disruption of mitotic heritabilitation of DNA-methylation is generally bad for survival of dividing cells. In dividing tumor cells Decitabine might especially affect CpG island methylation and therfore might be responsible for the good results observed in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, therefore alterations that have been caused by a drug upon a cell will also be found in subsequent daughter cells. Therfore the effect of a drug can persist.<br /><br />Sensitive period generally are times when cells are vulnerable to interferance. Times of epigenetic reprogramming in pre-implantation period and generation of primordial germ cells. Therefore treating pregnant women with epigenetic drugs is inadvisable. Also the time until a patient is fully grown is a sensitive period as altered epigenetic marks are inherited by many daughter-cells. Some phases in growing up (like when germ cells develop) can be more sensitive and make treatment with epigenetic drugs inadvisable.<br /></div>
