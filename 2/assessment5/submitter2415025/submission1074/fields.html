    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters, are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state, to promote donwstream tumour suppressor genes.<br />2. in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying genes including tumour suppressor genes.<br />3. DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to genetic mutation, leads to silence of tumour suppressor genes in cancer.<br />4. The normal DNA emthylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements prevents genomic instability.<br />5. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are depleted so deletions, insertions or translocations might occur in these genes.<br />6. Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. CTCF is methylated, Igf2 is expressed, but H19 is not expressed in patternal allele.<br />2. CTCF is not methylated, Igf2 is not expressed, but H19 is expressed in maternal allele.<br />3. CTCF is methylated in both maternal and paternal alleles, and Igf2 is over-expressed.<br />4. Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster result into over-expression of Igf2, or under-expression of H19, thus leads to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.<br />2. Decitabine reduce DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.<br />3. MDS happens due to DNA methylation thus loss of expression of cell growth control genes, Decitabine takes advantage of this mechanism by creating a more orderly DNA methylation profile, so it can have an anti-turmour effect.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. DNA methylation as an epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells.<br />2.  Sensitive period is when the epigenetic marks are being established.<br />3.  When people are undergoing its puberty where germ cells are being developed.<br />4. Use of such drugs on younger patients might needs caution as effectson germ cells need to be considered. <br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
