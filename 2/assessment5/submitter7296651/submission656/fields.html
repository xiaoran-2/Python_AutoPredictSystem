    <h1>Submission 656 from Anon (session_user_id: 11a12cc1dc946d4b31754c85e6efe8e6c69d3c49)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Histone methylation is linked to the turning on and off of genes, hence using a drug that eliminates these methylations have achieved some action on some genes involved in the process of cancer formation, either specifically over cancer causing genes or related genes, them being necessary for the tumor process to continue, nevertheless, the probability of adverse reactions could increase. The use of this type of medication during sensitive periods, meaning those periods in which epigenetic marks are susceptible to be eliminated, decreases the probability of success of the drug because  by affecting mathylation, the marks could be erased and could activate genes that normally should be mathylenated to achieve their silencing, thus avoiding adverse genetic reactions to be triggered, such as increasing the velocity of the spread of cancer or the emergence of tumors in other organs. Due that, the use of this medication by pregant women is not recommended, because the sensitive periods in the development of a human being occur during the first months of formation of an individual.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a drug whose function is to inhibit histone mathylaton, specifically EZH2 enzyme, as mentioned in the article, in the majority of tumor processes this enzyme is overactivated, which can cause the silencing of genes that have to do with repairing systems, or    Carry out some activation of genes that can lead to a significant advance in the tumor process. By using decitabine, it is possible that the excessive mathylations are eliminated, leaving only mathylatins caused by the genetic imprinting and therefore normalize the gene functioning.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>In the regions of the genome known as CpG islands, methylation is very low , due to that it, it is known that DNA methylation is linked to the silencing of genes, hence that if CpG islands, which are in the promoting regions, are methylated could suffer the silencing of essential genes. It has been found in caes of cancer, that CpG islands are hypermethylated, which causes severe problems, like in the genes related with DNA repair, by these methylations being in these zones, DNA is uncapable of repairing their damage or avoiding that the process of tumor formation or celular spreading through apoptosis systems be carried out. Tha lack of methylation in the repetitive regions avoids the accomplishments of transpositions that can affect the reading margins of some codifying regions. In camcer it has been found that these methylatins carry out in an exaggerated way which causes the transpositions to exist, realizing enzymatic cuts in these regions, which are liberated, thus a process of revolving of DNA takes place.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation in the paternal or maternal patterns may have certain functions, in the case of Igf2, maternal methylation pattern is responsible for activating, while his paternal pattern function is to suppress.</div>
