    <div class="field-value">Q1. Wish I could've given you full credit because you did such a nice job of keeping it simple and using your own words. Unfortunately I had to take some points off because: a) You said zero about tumor-suppressor genes, so no points there :-( b)You didn't say that there was genome-wide hypomethylation in cancer - you only talked about the specific areas that were hypomethylated (if it makes you feel any better, I think I missed that too - oops!). Finally, I was generous with "Methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements normally acts to protect genome stability." You didn't quite say it in these words, but it's apparent to me from the rest of your answer that you understood this. And again, your answer was easy to read, so consider it a bonus point :-).
Q2-So close! You forgot to talk about CTCF in the paternal allele. You mentioned methylation, but you didn't mention that CTCF can't bind because of it, so I had to take a point off. On the question about Wilm's tumor, again you mentioned methylation but forgot to mention CTCF, so there went another point. But the rest was good! Again, you used your own words, and it was apparent that you understand what was going on, so nicely done!
Q3-Beautiful! I'm guessing that by "antitumoral factors" you mean tumor-suppressing genes. Giving you the benefit of the doubt ;-)
Q4-Almost there! Although you said this using different words, the key thing they were looking for here was "mitotically heritable." You really needed to use this words, so I took a point off because they weren't there. In the last part, I had to take a point off because you state that "treating in this period could have adverse effects in the rest of the life of the patient as once estabilished the epigenetic marks stay in place", but this is only part of the problem. The other part is that you would disrupt the establishment of these epigenetic marks. So you were close, but not quite there.
Overall, nice job. You really showed me that you understood the material, and you should be proud :-)</div>
