    <h1>Submission 296 from Anon (session_user_id: 7a3a8e13ff5e2d2fa90a22953ff66f6ff0015407)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The CpG islands are usually found at the promoter region of a gene and are usually found unmethylated regardless of their activity. In cancer those are often found methylated and inactive as methylation is related with silencing of a gene. <br />Methylation of repetitive elements and intragenic regions serves the role of silencing the trasposons and alternative starting site for trascription and regulate the alternative splicing, in cancer those are hypomethylated so this augment the mutagenity and the genomic instability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In paternal allele the imprinting control region (ICR) of the H19 gene is methylated so the transcriptional enhancers downstream help to transcript the Igf2 gene, moreover the methylation on H19's ICR often continue on the H19 gene proper silencing it. <br />In maternal allele the H19's ICR isn't methyled because of that it bind the CTCF molecule, the CTCF-ICR complex formed have the role of impede the trascription of the Igf2 gene upstream and promote the H19 transcription. In Wilm's tumor both the allele are methylated and so much more Igf2 trascribed. Igf2 is a growth factor so an upregulation of his transcription ends up in an augmented cellular proliferation</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an hypomethylating agent, in the case of Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that get incorporated into DNA strands, there it works as inhibitor of the methyltransferase, although is similar to cytosine  it don't become methylated, this could have an anti-tumoral effect because this way the antiproliferation factors don't get methyleted and so get reactivated.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell the methylation state is passed to the next cellular generation, so it "fixed" for the lifetime except for the sensitive (or critical) periods, this are two periods in the phase of embryonic preimplantation and during the gamete development where most of the methylation of the imprinting region get cleared, another period of development is during the tissue specific maturation, this can occur in various specific phases of life usually in childhood, treating in this period could have adverse effects in the rest of the life of the patient as once estabilished the epigenetic marks stay in place</div>
