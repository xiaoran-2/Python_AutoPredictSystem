    <h1>Submission 435 from Anon (session_user_id: 20aa80772fbac9dabf00801dcf38c61b32664612)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decibatine is a DNA demethylating agent. It is a cytosine analogue that inhibits DNA methyltransferase causing a reduction in methylation of CpG islands. Because DNA methylation typically reduces gene expression, reducing DNA methylation allows tumour suppressor genes to be expressed. The tumour suppressors have an anti-tumour effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are normally unmethylated. This allows for expression of the nearby gene. Addition of a methyl group to C at the CpG island reduces (silences) gene expression. Individual CpG islands (and sets of them) can be hypermethylated in cancer. This reduces expression of tumour suppressor genes, tipping the balance in favour of tumour growth. Methylation itself is also mutagenic as methylcytosine is deaminated to thymine, mutating C to T. The ratio of CpG island methylation to unmethylated cytosine increases as cells progress from normal to hyperplastic to neoplastic to invasive.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetititive elements are usually methylated. Here they silence cryptic transcription start and splice sites and prevent transposition, transcriptional interference and illegitimate recombination. Loss of methylation leads to genomic instability such as insertions, deletions and translations.<br /><br />Bestor's Genome Defence Model indicates that DNA methylation is beneficially mutagenic, protecting the genome from transposable elements.The genome-wide hypomethylation found in all cancers reduces the effectiveness of this genome defence mechanism.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting is a form of epigenetic regulation in which some genes are silenced according to their parental origin.<br /><br />The imprint control region (ICR) on chromosome 11 (H19/Igf2) uses enhancer blocking as its mechanism of action.The ICR is usually methylated on the paternal allele but unmethylated on the maternal allele. The unmethylated ICR in the maternal allele allows binding of CTCF. This is an insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers thus reducing maternal Igf2 expression. The H19 promoter remains active thus increasing H19 expression.<br /><br />ICR methylation in the paternal allele prevents CTCF binding and spreads to the H19 promoter, silencing it and reducing H19 expression. In the absence of CTCF, Igf2 is not insulated so enhancers spread to and activate it.<br /><br />Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is an imprinted condition caused by linked abnormalities in Kcnq1 and H19/Igf2. The maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele. It includes fetal and postnatal overgrowth because of an overdose of Igf2. This condition is associated with a tendency to childhood tumours e.g. Wilm's because Igf2 acts as an oncogene (stimulating growth). The Kcnq1 abnormality leads to loss of the tumour suppressing action of Cdkn1c.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">An epigenetic change is mitotically heritable so is present in subsequent generations of the cell. A sensitive period is a part of life (typically brief) when cells are more susceptible to epigenetic change due to altered environments. Sensitive periods include the period between fertilisation and implantation, the period of germ cell development, later intrauterine life and infancy. Treatment in a sensitive period risks permanent alteration of DNA methylation and so permanent modification of gene expression. This is likely to affect genes non-specifically not just those affected by the cancer.</div>
