    <h1>Submission 341 from Anon (session_user_id: d3addae4b81fe802f2be85f241f14649127d9577)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation is passed on to every daughter cell in each division. So it will not only affect the current tumour-cells but also their descendants. <br /></li><li>There are periods when the environment can influence to the epigenetic state of the celles. These are the sensitive periods. There are two principal sensitive periods: the early embryonic stages and primordial cells generation. <br /></li><li>Given this, any drug which that can affect cell's epigenetic state, will highly affect both the early embryo in pregnant women and primordial germ cells generation in adults. So, it is unadvisable to treat with such drugs mainly pregant women, but I assume it will unadvisable to treat men that are trying to conceive a baby. <br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In normal cells <strong>CpG islands</strong> are unmethylated and even protected from methylation (their methylation state, however does not correlated with the expression of the gene whose promoter they are in). <br /></li><li>In cancer, however, we find a hypermethylation of these CpG island which is related to cell silencing (of tumor supressor genes, for example). This methylation can act through a change in chromatin structure or throught an alteration in transcription factor binding.<br /></li><li>This CpG methylation can be found in tumor-supressor genes. And so, if you inhibit their expression, you add one milestone in the road leading to cancer.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>In contrast, <strong>intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong> are found hypermethylated in normal cells, and hypomethylated in tumor cells. <br /></li><li>This methylation is associated with genomic integrity (through different mechanisms). So, the hypomethylation leads to the genome instability tightly associated with cancer cells which, in turn, leads to an increase number of mutations and genetic alterations.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The paternal Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated whereas the maternal one is not. <br /></li><li>The CTCF element binds to the unmethylated ICR and allows the enhancers to express H19 but not Igf2 (in the maternal allele). <br /></li><li>In the paternal allele, CTCF can not bind to ICR (because it's methylated) and thus the enhancers allows Igf2 transcription. <br /></li><li>In Wilm's Tumor, there is a hypermethylation found in both alleles (maternal and paternal) and so, we will no find H19 expression and we will detect more expression of Igf2 (coming from both alleles). <br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agents, so its treatment will decrease the methylation state of cells. <br /></li><li>In cancer we find a whole-genome hypermethilation which might be related to changes in the chromatin architecture and so, in the expression pattern of differents genes. The DNA-demethylating drugs may revert some of this effects. <br /></li></ul></div>
