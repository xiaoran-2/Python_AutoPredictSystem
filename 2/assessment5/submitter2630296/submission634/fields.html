    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands in the promoter regions lead to the silencing of downstream gene expression. In normal cells, CpG island within gene promoters are kept free of methylation that is independent of the activity state. However, CpG islands in cancer cells are often hypermethylated, which lead to gene silencing. If the silencing happens to tumor suppressor or DNA repair genes, it may lead to cancer. In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to provide genome stability since these regions may function as transposons and could induce silencing/activation of neighboring genes which disrupts normal gene functions. In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are often hypomethylated, rendering genome instability. Moreover, if hypomethylation-induced transcription activation happens to oncogenes, this will lead to tumor growth as well. Therefore, both hypermetylation in CpG islands and hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contribute to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In paternal allele, the ICR is methylated so the enhancers will be able to access igf2 promoter and induce igf2 expression. In maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, which recruits CTCF (the insulator element) that precludes the enhancer access to igf2. As a result the enhancer act on H19 instead of igf2, leading to no igf2 expression. In Wilm's tumor, the ICR at both paternal and maternal alleles are methylatead, leading to the over-expression of igf2, which is a growth promoter that result in the formation of tumor. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a cytidine analog and classified as DNA-demethylating agents. It hypometylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Hypermethylation is found in CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes in tumors. Therefore, by inhibiting DNA methylation, the blockage to tumor suppressor genes can be cleared, promoting anti-tumor activity in cells. On the other hand, Decitabine also acts as antimetabolites. Being incorporated into the cell, Decitabine can induce cyto-toxicity that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation on the DNA sequence is mitotically heritable and can have enduring effects on the epigenome. Sensitive periods refer to the life stage that has increased sensitivity/more susceptible to regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. The sensitive periods of development are thought to be comprised of: 1. gamete formation and 2. early embryonic development during which the epigenetic marks are cleared and reset, in other words, they undergo epigenetic reprogramming. If you treat patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation in these periods, it may disrupt normal DNA methylation patterns. For instance, if you inhibit DNA methyltransferase, then the DNA metylation in normal cells will be inhibited and thus lead to abnormal epigenetic reprogramming. As a result, treating the patients during sensitive periods should be avoided.</div>
