    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are found in approximately 60% of promoters and most of them are not methylated. Promoters are located at the start of genes, where transcription machinery binds. This means that the activity of promoters affect the expression of the underlying genes. DNA methylation at CpG islands lead to silencing by two mechanisms: first, methylated CpG in a CpG island is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure; second, methylated CpG can prohibit transcription factor binding and alter gene expression. In cancer cells, the CpG islands of promoters are hypermethylated, which leads to silencing of expression of tumour suppressor genes, which control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. Known single-gene examples of CpG island hypermethylation that contribute to cancer include <em>RB </em>in retinablastoma<em>, MLH1 i</em>n colorectal cancer,<em> BRCA1 i</em>n breast cancer and<em> MGMT </em>in gliomas and colorectal tumours.<br /><br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is important to maintain genomic integrity. These regions tend to make genome unstable, which can cause abnormal karyotype through mechanisms such as deletions, reciprocal translocations, and insertions. DNA methylation in intergenic regions lead to silencing of cryptic transcription start sits or cryptic splice sites. DNA methylation in repetitive elements causes silencing of repeats to prevent transposition and to prevent illegitimate recombination. Cancer cells alter the methylation of these regions to make them hypomethylated. This causes genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting is a monoallelic gene expression based on parent-of-origin of the allele.The expression of imprinted genes is controlled by imprint control regions (ICRs). ICR controls imprinted gene expression by different mechanisms that can involve long-noncoding RNAs, enhancer/insulator blocking and others. An example of mechanisms involving enhancer blocking is <i>H19/Igf2 </i>cluster. The ICR in the middle of the cluster is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele (paternally imprinted). In this cluster long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19 is produced only from maternal allele. The ICR in the maternal allele is bound by insulator protein CTCF, which functions to insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Instead, the enhancers access H19 and enhance its expression on the maternal allele. in the paternal allele, DNA methylation at ICR blocks the binding of CTCF. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence while enhancers access Igf2 to activate. In Wilm's tumour, the ICR in the maternal allele is hypermethylated, which enables the enhancers to activate the Igf2 expression in this allele as well, causing over expression. Because Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene, the over expression of this gene contribute to cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase-inhibitor (DNMTi). As a nucleoside analogue, it irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA upon replication. This means that it is replication-dependent. Since cancer cells divide much more rapidly and replicate more often, they are severely affected by this drug. At low dose this drug causes DNA demethylation and causes anti neo-plastic effect. The mechanism of action seem to be dependent on hypermethylation of CpG islands. In some cancers, notably myelodysplastic syndrome, the CpG islands are hypermethylated. Hypermethylation can cause inactivation of genes essential for the control of normal cell growth, differentiation, or apoptosis. By inhibiting DNMT, the drug causes hypomethylation of the CpG islands of these genes, which result in re-expression of tumor suppressor genes. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation during maintenance period of epigenetic reprogramming affect cancer cells more than normal cells. For example, a DNMTi works as a nucleoside analog is replication-dependent, and thus affect cancer cells severely because they divide more rapidly and replicate more often. All daughter cells produced by cancer cells will carry these alterations and therefore their gene expression and activity will be altered by the drugs beyond period of treatment.<br /><span><br />There are two periods of development in which epigenetic reprogramming is susceptible to environmental signals. First, during early development which starts from gamete stage to blastocyst stage. Second, during primordial germ cell and germ cell development starting from primordial germ cell stage to gamete stage. Alterations of epigenetic reprogramming during sensitive periods result in epigenetic abnormalities. The abnormalities can be mitotically heritable, so when cells exposed to the drugs divide, all daughter cells will have these abnormalities. If drugs given during early cell development, resulting alterations will cause broad-scale epigenetic reprogramming abnormalities resulting in imprinting defects in all cell linages. If drugs given during germ cell development, there is a potential of transgenerational epigenetic </span>inheritance through the gametes.The gametes will carry epigenetic reprogramming abnormalities, resulting in imprinting defects in offspring.</div>
