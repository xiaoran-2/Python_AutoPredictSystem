    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In normal
cells, the DNA is methylated only in specific locus like introns, intragenic
regions or repetitive elements. Normally methylation is synonym of silencing.
In a normal cell, the CpG islands and  CpG islands shores of tumor suppressor
genes are not methylated. By contrast in cancer, most CpG islands are found
hypermethylated and the genome wide hipomethylated. DNA methylation in CpG
islands is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor
genes and it was frequently observed in many tumors because DNA methylation is
mitotically heritable and/ or epimutations are selected rapidly. The
hypermethylation of CpG islands in some cancer types correlates well with no
gene expression of normal tissue differentiation. In cancer, the cell growth
evading suppressors, resisting cell death, avoiding immune destruction,… These
hallmarks can be correlated with CpG methylation.<br />
On the other hand, hypomethylation in CpG poor promoters is correlated with
oncogene activation.<br /><br />
The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive
elements is silencing these elements in order to provide more genomic
stability. In cancer a low level of methylation at intergenic regions and
repetitive elements was found. The final consequence of hypomethilation depends
on locations, but was described an illegitimate recombination between repeats;
an activation of repeats and trasposition, and the activation of cryptic
promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. The consequence was genome instability
and mutation present in cancer.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine
is a drug used to treat cancer. They inhibited the protein who adds methyl
groups to histones cues. The presence of this protein in to high in some kind
of cancer (linfomas) and the result of this action is hypermethylation of the
histones cues. This methylation silenced some surrounding genes and increased
mutation rate in regions of heterochromatin. As a result of more instability
was present. <br />
This drug blocked the protein actions and resulting a new epigenome.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Hypermethylation at ICRs means loss of imprinting. Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs, can result in loss of expression of growth restriction genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes. Eg Wilm's tumor is an hypermethylation of maternal allele with consequence of overexpression of lgf2 (one paternal and one maternal).<br />In normal cell, only was expressed the paternal lgf2 due to a methylation  of ICR. The maternal allele was not methylated and H19 was expressed.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The DNA
methylation is a special feature that can be reader by genetic machinery and
result in a different phenotype,it  was considered an epigenetic mark. <br />
Adding methyl groups results a different architecture of chromatin. The
consequence may be silencing or activating gene expression.<br />
Sensitive period is the period of time where the action of drugs could present
high effects.<br />
The sensitive periods of developments are when epignetics marks are
reprogramming: in germ cells and early embryonic development.<br />
In this time the methyl marks are erased from all genome</span></p>
