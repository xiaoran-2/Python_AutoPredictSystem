    <div class="field-value">In cancer, there is hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG islands shores; and hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Imprinting control regions can be either hypermethylated or hypomethylated. <br /><br />CpG islands in normal cells are usually unmethylated and therefore the corresponding genes are active. When CpG islands are methylated the genes become silenced. In cancer cells most CpG islands become methylated, increasing the number of genes that is silenced, including tumour suppressor genes, which are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration and survival. So, proteins that help regulate these functions are not present and the cells uncontrollably proliferate, are able to migrate to other tissues, and are more resistant to apoptosis thus being almost immortal. <br /><br />On the contrary, normal cells are methylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements as a way to maintain genomic stability and avoid chromossomal duplications, and gene translocations, insertions and deletions. In cancer cells, these regions become hypomethylated, allowing genomic instability to occur, which highly influences cancer appearance.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, the imprinting control region (ICR) of the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated. The promoter of H19 is also methylated, so this gene is silenced. The enhancers are then able to induce the transcription of Igf2. However, the ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated, so the insulator CTCF binds to it and blocks the action of the enhancers upon Igf2. As a result, Igf2 is not transcribed, and H19 is transcribed instead. So, in normal cells, there is expression of Igf2 only from the paternal allele.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, the ICR of the maternal allele is methylated, so the H19/Igf2 cluster behaves like in a paternal allele: H19 is silenced and the enhancers activate the expression of Igf2. H19 may act as a tumour suppressor, and Igf2 is an oncogene and promotes growth. So, when the imprinting of this cluster is disrupted there is overexpression of the oncogene Igf2 and cells proliferate more. Moreover, H19 expression is decreased and therefore it is not able to exerce its function of controlling growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases that is a nucleoside analogue and is incorporated into DNA during replication. It binds irreversibly to DNA methyltransferases and prevents DNA methylation to occur. As a result, there is a decrease in methylation. Tumours can be characterized by hypermethylation of CpG islands, which can affect the expression of tumour suppressors. So, using this drug can be helpful to decrease this hypermethylation and induce the expression of tumor suppressors that were silenced, being then able to regulate cell proliferation, migration and survival.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation patterns are mitotically heritable, which means that many cells of an organism will possess the same methylation epigenetic marks. Moreover, DNA methylation is maintained during the life of an organism, except for 2 periods in which these marks are removed. This epigenetic reprogramming occurs during primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development. These periods are classified as sensitive because any changes in epigenetic marks that occur can have long lasting effects. So, if a child is treated with this drug, since germ cell development is a sensitive period, DNA methylation of germ cells would be altered. Therefore, this treatment should be avoided to prevent future possible long term effects that can be harmful.<br /><br /></div>
