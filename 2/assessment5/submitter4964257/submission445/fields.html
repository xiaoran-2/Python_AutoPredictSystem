    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during
cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively
erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that
epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without
having to kill all its cells.</p>

<p>Sensitive period is the period in which
it occurs epigenetic reprograming. we have two phases of epigenetic reprogramming. The first is during
preimplantation development, and the second is during primordial germ cell
development. So, preimplantation development as it sounds, is that period
before the embryo implants and makes a placenta. The second phase of reprogramming
is the embryo that's developed to mid gestation, we have predominantly somatic
cells except for the primordial germ cells.</p>

<p>The sensitive period so that one very large insult to the
environment would be taking a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery. So
these sorts of things still need to be considered, but it seems that the future
is bright for targeting the epigenetic machinery in cancer. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions
inversely correlates with gene expression. Exceptions are CpG islands, which
are found in about 60% of promoters. They have a high CpG density and are
usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state.</p>

<p><span>·         </span> In cancer cells promoter
CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the
underlying gene. This causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling
cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG
islands.</p>

<p><span>·         </span>In
the normal genome and we didn't lose chromosomes, gain chromosomes or have
illegitimate  recombinations
.  So then if you have
hypomethylation of  repeats
or indeed intergenic intervals, the regions that aren't necessarily repetitive
but are between genes. Now, in a normal cell, this recombination wouldn't
happen because the repeats would be heavily methylated and also they'd be
heterchromatonized.</p>

<p><span>·         </span>So recombination needs open
chromatin, euchromatin, and then recombination can occur. Otherwise, the DNA is
too densely packaged for recombination to occur. But in the context of cancer
we have hypomethylation of these repetitive elements or the intergenic regions.
They align, they misalign, and then an illegitimate recombination can occur
because they are not densely packaged down into heterochromatin. We know that
the repeats can also be activated because of the hypomethylation.</p>

<p><span>·         </span>In DNA hypomethylation, you
find increased genomic instability in that particular tissue, and then they end
up with a particular type of cancer.</p>

<p><span>·         The
driving role of DNA methylation is context dependent. While all tumors tend to
show CpG island hypermethylation and genome-wide hypomethylation, different
tumors have different dependencies on each of these particular aberrant
demethylation profiles. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the patternal allele when this imprint control
region is methlyated CTCF can now no longer bind. And if CTCF isn't binding and
there is no insulator action then these enhancers are indeed free to act on
Igf2. And promote Igf2's expression from the paternal allele. </p><p>And therefore, Igf2 is expressed only from the
paternal allele and not the maternal allele. So this is how we end up with
imprinted expression of Igf2. But the reason that H19 is now no longer active
on the paternal allele is because of heterochromatin spreading, or DNA methylation
spreading. And this, in this case, this methylation </p><p>is indeed synonymous with gene silencing. </p><p>





</p><p><span>Cdkn1c as a tumor suppressor, it restricts growth. iIf
you have no Cdkn1c expression and up regulation of IGF2 in other words in it's
overall you're growth promoting it's an oncogene. It have predisposed to
embryonic or childhood tumours. So the most common one Wilms tumor.This loss of
imprinting and over expression of growth promoting genes or loss of those suppress
genes because of the loss of imprinting is actually a common feature. But in
fact in general in cancer and so many imprinted genes are involved in controlling
growth. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Decitabine belongs to
class histone-deacetylase
inhibitors.</p>

<p>The
decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is a cytosine nucleoside analogue that
selectively inhibits DNA methyltransferase in low doses, resulting in
hypomethylation of gene promote that may result in the reactivation of tumor
suppressor genes, induction of cell differentiation or cellular senescence,
followed by programmed cell death. At high concentrations (&gt; 10-4 M)
decitabine is markedly cytotoxic.  Sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese
company, are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute
myelogenous leukaemia.</p>

<p>Decitabine
produced a synergistic effect in growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis
in tumors cells. This effect was time dependent, mediated via caspase-3 activation,
and resulted in increased levels of acetylated histones.</p></div>
