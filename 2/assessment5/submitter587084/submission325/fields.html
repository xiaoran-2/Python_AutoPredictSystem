    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methymation at CpG islands in normal cells is usually associated to hypomethylation, with hypermethylation occuring mostly in repetitive elements, intergenic regions and even introns. This clustering of CpGs tends to occur in given regions of genes, namely the promoters, where transcription starts. So, CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation and their hypermethylation is associated with silencing of gene expression.<br /></li><li>In cancer as you progress from normal tissue, to hyperplasia, neoplasia and invasion there is a progressive decrease in the global level of methylation, accompanied by an increase in the level of some CpG-island methylation. Indeed, cancer cells typically present hypermethylation at CpG islands and hypomethylation in repetitive elements, introns and intergenic regions. </li><li>For a cancer to occur, multiple hits are necessary. DNA methylation is considered one of those hits, particularly when it happens at CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes. So, these genes,when expressed could help in the containment of cancer. If silenced by this CpG island hypermethylation, it provides the cancer cells with advantage to progress to malignancy (neoplasia and invasion). It has been found in almost all tumours and as it is mitotically heritable, it is passed on to daughter cells and is also quickly expanded. They vary by tumour type.             </li><li>Cancer cells typically present hypomethylation in repetitive elements, introns and intergenic regions, in opposition to normal cells that tend to be highly methylated in these same regions.</li><li>Hypomethymation happens early in tumourigenesis, progresses in time, occurs frequently in repeats and in many tumour types. Hypermethylation in these regions of DNA ensure genomic stability and this also ensures heterochromatization. With hypomethylation, chromatin structure is open and one will have illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activatingcryptic promoters and disrupting neighbouring genes. The consequence is reciprocal translocations, insertions and deletions: loss of genomic stability.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Cancer cells often display loss of imprinting,i.e. do not display mono-allelic parent of origin specific expression, which is mutually exclusive expression from the paternal or the maternal allele. In the case of cancer, one can observe that you can get either expression from both alleles or silencing from both the maternal and parental alleles. </li><li>Importantly, many of the genes that are imprinted are involved in growth, either promoting or suppressing it. ICR methylation in cancer can be of hypo or hypermethylation, depending on whether genes are growth promoters or suppressors, respectively.</li><li>In the Igf2/H19 cluster, when the ICR is hypomethylated (maternal), CTCF  binds and enhancers  induce maternal expression of H19. Due to Igf2 hypermethylated in the maternal allele, it will not be expressed.  The paternal H19 is hypermethylated, so enhancers act on Igf2, we have paternal expression of Igf2 but not of H19.</li><li>In Wilm's Tumour we observe hypermethylation of the insulator element in the maternal and paternal allele, so Igf2 is expressed from both alleles. This double dose of the growth promoter protein Igf2 is the result of loss of imprinting and occurs usually in early preneoplastic events, , providing the tumour cell with an advantage to grow quicker than normal cells.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. So, it removes methylation from the DNA. <br /></li><li>Although this drug was not very efficient during the <span>trial itself, because many of the patients did not respond well to it, then displayed a good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them next. The hypothesis is that </span>these epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in a way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.<br /></li><li><span>Epigenetic changes mytotically heritable until they are actively erased, as it seems to be the case with Decitabine, and then they do not return. </span></li><li><span>So Decitabine, by removing methymation, probably devoids cancer of a given advantage in their growth ability, most likely.  <br /></span></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because it is mitotically heritable. So, the effect is perpetuated to daughter cells.</li><li>A sensitive period is a period when epigenetic marks are remmoved and so cells are particularly sensitive to the re-implantation of a new epigenetic signature. </li><li>sensitive priods of development are during primordial germ cell development and during the pre-implantation period in early development.</li><li>Treating patients during sensitive periods would possibilitate the laying-down of epigenetic marks that might be prejudicial by themselves and do more harm than good.</li></ul></div>
