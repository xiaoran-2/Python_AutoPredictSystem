    <h1>Submission 46 from Anon (session_user_id: 74bf772c190d5eef935c8e083a2aa2fc62cf1634)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the family of epigenetic drugs named DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine effect on DNA methylation is based on the inhibition of DNA methyltranferase, therefor it switches the methylation state of DNA to one of demethylation. Cancer cells are characterized by an increased status of methylation of DNA in CpG islands, which is why demethylating agents are suitable for caner treatment since this drugs bring the cells back to a CpG island demethylated status which is a feature of non cancer  or non overproliferating cells. The antitumor effect can be based off the ability to demethylate cpg islands of tumour supressor genes that are genes in charge of stopping the uncontrolled growth that causes cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The normal function of CpG  island methylation is silencing of gene expression. Methylation of CpG  islands can also stop the binding of a transcription factors to that particular gene and there for avoid transcriptional activation. In Cancer CpG island methylation is altered in a way in which it is increased particularly at tumor supressor genes , in these genes the levels of CpG methylation is increased, the increase in methylation at this particular sites is responsible for silencing of tumor supressor genes and in consequence establishment of the oncogenic phenotype. CpG methylation has importances in aspects of diagnostic, prognostic , monitor and treatment of cancers since they can be used as biomarkers to establish tumor phenotypes  that could be used to determine treatment. Monitoring of CpG islands as biomarkers in cancer can be used to determine weather a treatment is working or not. The function of methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is there to maintain the genomic integrity and stability. Silencing of repeats prevents transposition, avoids transcriptional interference from strong promoters and may prevent illegitimate recombination. In cancer DNA methylation if intergenic regions and repetitive elements is diminished, therefor disrupted. The contribution of DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements to cancer arises from their contribution to genome instability, rendering cells with an abnormal Kariotype including deletions insertions and also translocation of Chromosomes, in the case of repetitive elements this happens because an opened chromatin allows for recombination of those repetitive elements and this allows for genomic unstability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele the binding site for the blocker CTCF is methylated and  its methylation is spreaded all the way to the H19 gene CpG island making H19 no longer active. Methylation of CTCF binding site blocks it's binding site, so CTCF cannot block the enhancers from having access to Igf2, which is the preferred choice by the enhancers, and this allows expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele. <br />In the case of the maternal allele the binding site for CTCF is unmethylated and therefor CTCF can bind and  since it is an insulator protein it insulates Igf2 from the enhancer regions, since Igf2 is insulated the enhancers are free to act in H19, activating it's transcription, this happens because of chromatin looping, in this case Igf2 is not going to be expressed from the maternal allele. <br />Wilm’s tumour is characterized for gain in expression of Igf2 which promotes growing and loss of expression of CDKN1C which is a tumor supressor this happens mostly due to uniparental disomy. Since there is only one set of parental alleles there is double expression if Igf2 from the paternal alelle and while the maternal alelle is missing it cannot express CDKN1C.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, which means that treatment with epigenetic agents can have consequences that shall be there to last through generations of cell replication. Sensitive periods are periods of extensive epigenetic reprograming such as early embryonic development, and childhood, since epigenetic marks are not established in oocytes until puberty. Well in regards of  the treatment during this sensitive periods, it should not be done since epigenetic reprogramming might have consequences that are not to be seen in generations, for example treating early childhood cancer with epigenetic agents can lead to unknown changes in a females oocytes, or even worse in a pregnant woman can lead to malformation of the fetus , miscarriage or even in the pregnancy goes to end can lead to epigenetic changes not to be seen until  the children of that fetus are born.</div>
