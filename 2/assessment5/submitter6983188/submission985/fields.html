    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a common epigenetic mechanism used to alter the chromatin structure surrounding segments of DNA. They commonly occur at Cytosine bases which are followed by Guanine bases, forming a 5-methyl Cytosine. This can recruit certain proteins which in turn perform the action of condensing the DNA within the region of the methylated CpG group; this ultimately reduces exposure of DNA to transcription factors.<br /><br />CpG islands can usually be found at the promoters of certain genes, including those which encode for tumour suppressor proteins, and are usually protected from methylation, therefore maintaining an active promoting state. Hypermethylation of these islands takes place in cancer, silencing the promoter and suppressing the transcription of the relevant protein, including various tumour suppressors.<br /><br />Alternatively, tumours have been found to regularly contain hypomethylated intergenic and repetitive regions. Usually methylation of these regions serve to silence certain growth enhancers such as R-RAS, but also silence and prevent the activity of repetitive elements. Methylation therefore acts to enhance genome stability, which would otherwise result in abnormal karyotypes and inappropriate growth. Hypomethylation of these regions exposes the repetitive elements and activates growth enhancers usually silenced, creating genomic instability. <br /><br />Finally, tumours have shown methylation disruption in Imprint Control Regions, which can take place through either hypo-, or hypermethylation. This causes inappropriate doses of certain genomic components which may enhance cancer growth, as they disrupt the maternal and paternal equilibrium in doses. <br /><br />Sources: Lectures from this course.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/IGF2 Cluster the ICR is typically found at the centre of a 1 megabase cluster. <br />In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, silencing its activity. This silencing causes an insulator protein (CTCF) to loose its presence, allowing for activation of the IGF2 by downstream enhancers. However, the ICRs methylation causes a downstream effect where the methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, causing H19 to be silenced. <br />In the maternal allele, however, the ICR is unmethylated, which causes the CTCF insulator protein to maintain its presence, causing inactivation of the IGF2 gene. The downstream enhancers are blocked in their IGF2 promoting ability, however, they cause activity in H19. This is a result of chromatin looping, where the enhancers have a higher affinity towards the IGF2 gene, blocking causes the affinity to switch towards H19. <br />In Beckwiedemann's Syndrome the maternal gene contains epigenetic abnormalities which result in two paternal-like alleles, therefore increasing IGF2 dosage (a growth enhancing protein). This causes rapid cell growth, especially in early childhood, resulting in Wilm's tumour. <br /><br />Sources:<br />Lectures<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a Citidine Analog, that is it emulates the structure of the Cytosine and Ribose Ring joint structure. It therefore acts as a prodrug inhibitor of the DNA methyltransferases. The cell converts decitabine to decitabine triphosphate in the S phase of the cell cycle which is then incorporated directly into the DNA, this in turn forms adducts with DNA methyltransferase molecules, preventing their further action. This causes hypomethylation which in turn would re-activate silenced genes which are involved in regular cellular processes such as apoptosis (cell suicide in certain appropriate conditions) and cell growth suppression/senescence. The re-activation of these genes would either return early stage tumour cells to normal function, or cause cell death/growth inhibition of late stage cancer cells. <br />It is used for patients suffering from Acute Myeloid Leukaemia over the age of 65 (in the UK).<br />Sources:<br /><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3888021/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3888021/</a><br /><a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/about-cancer/treatment/cancer-drugs/decitabine">http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/about-cancer/treatment/cancer-drugs/decitabine</a><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Abnormal DNA methylation can cause a variety of effects on the epigenome, from inducing cancerous phenotypes to causing resistance to certain drugs. Pharmacogenomic (including epigenetic) profiling of tumours can therefore be used to identify key phenotypic features of the genome that may be used to govern therapy selection. Examples of this include cisplatin resistance by methylation, where Azacytidine (similar to Decitabine) can resensitize those cells to cisplatin, reverting their acquired resistance. This suggests that these drugs can indeed have long-lasting indirect effects on cancers.<br />However, the nature of these drugs mechanisms of action suggest that they may interupt key periods in human development, particularly early development and primordial germ cell development, or any other period with epigenetic reprogramming may take place. This is because methylation reprogramming is a key component of this development change. Introducing these drugs may cause a hypomethylated genome, which is particularly worrying as methylation is mitotically heritable. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would therefore cause lifelong changes in the genome which may in itself result in genomic instabilities (resulting from active repetitive regions) and cancerous phenotypes. This would ultimately lead to mortality.<br />Sources:<br /><a title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22249249" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22249249">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22249249</a><br /><br /></div>
