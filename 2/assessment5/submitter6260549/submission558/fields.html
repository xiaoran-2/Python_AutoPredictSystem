    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are found at promoter regions of a gene and are generally hypomethylated in a normal cell. In a cancerous cell, the CpG island becomes hypermethylated in tumour supressor genes. Tumour supressor genes in a normal cell controls cell growth, stopping any inapporpiate growth, however when the CpG island is hypermethylated it silences the tumour supressor gene so cells can divide and grow rapidly and continuously without regulation, causing cancer. As methylation of the CpG island is mitotically heritable, daughter cells also have hypermethylated CpG islands and therefore silent tumour supressor genes etc.<br /><br />In a normal cell intergenic regions and repitive elements are methylated and within heterocromatin. This ensures the genomic integrity/stability remains as when they are transcribed they cannot lodge themselves elsewhere in the genome due to the densly packed chromatin and methylation. In a cancerous cell, the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated leading to an open (euchromatin) unstable genome where the intergenic regions and repeats can hop and insert into the genome causing deletions, insertions, duplications and translocations of chromosomes. As the intergenic regions and repetitive elements have strong promoters they can lodge themselves into the middle or at the start of a gene which should be switched off and turn it on with its own promoter.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele the imprint control region (ICR) of the gene is methylated. This methylation silences the H19 promoter as the methylation speads from the ICR. This allows enhancers to act on Igf2 and activate the gene as the CTCF protein cannot bind to the methylated ICR. <br /><br />On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated which allows the CTCF protein to bind. CTCF blocks the enhancers downstream from acting upon Igf2 gene and instead activate H19 gene expression.<br /><br />Wilms tumour occurs when the maternal allele acts like a paternal allele so the normally silent maternal Igf2 gene is activated so double the amount of Igf2 protein is produced. This loss of imprinting can be caused by deletions or mutations within the H19/Igh2 cluster or when 2 copies of the paternal allele is inherited. Igf2 is an oncogene so promotes the growth of a cell which can then lead to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The class of inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to is the DNA methyl transferase inhibitors. Decitabine slots into the DNA during replication and binds irreversibly to DNA methyl transferases stopping their activity and thus stopping DNA methylation. In tumour supressor genes the lack of methylation will casuse the gene to go back to its original state (ie activate the gene to its original function) and regulate cell growth. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so changes to methylation of the genome will be passed on to daughter cells.<br />Sensitive periods occur in order to remove epigeneic marks from DNA to restore totipotency. This makes sure a single cell can differentiate into any cell. <br />Sensitive periods of development include early development (when the fertilised egg is growing into a bastocyst) and primordial germ cell and germ cell deveopment (when germ cells are developing).<br />Treating patients during these sensitive periods may cause irreversible changes to the DNA which are then passed on to daughter cells. These irreversible changes could activate tumour surpressor genes or cause mutations etc.<br /></div>
