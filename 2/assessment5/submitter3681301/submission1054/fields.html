    <div class="field-value">Cancer is a large family of diseases that may originate from single genetic or epigenetic aberrations, but usually results from a larger number of these oncogenic combinations. One such factor influencing tumorigenesis is a deviation from the normal lack of methylation at CpG islands: localized DNA hypermethylation. DNA hypermethylation in the regions that make up CpG islands can have the effect of silencing tumor suppressor genes. When these tumor suppressor genes are silenced, their protective effect is lost, which appears to be the pathway by which oncogenesis occurs. Tumor suppressor genes normally encourage apoptosis or limit the cell cycle or cellular division.<br /><br />lncRNAs (long noncoding RNAs) originate from intergenomic regions, between areas in the genome that encode proteins. They often associate with chromatin remodeling complexes, and influence pluripotency. In case of genetic damage, however, they can influence oncogenesis as well. Just like the aberrations in DNA methylation described above, intergenic and repetitive regions are also susceptible to methylation changes, and in cancer these normally-methylated intergenic regions turn out to have lower than expected methylation. Apparently, cancer is not always associated with hypermethylation. In fact, genome-wide hypomethylation is associated with cancer, despite the finding that in at least CpG islands, this effect is opposite. The difference in methylation can cause genomic instability, and as such contribute to the formation of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation patterns on the maternal and paternal alleles exhibit parent-of-origin specific methylation marks. One such difference lies in the imprint control region. These differences can result in both the diminished expression of growth restricting genes and higher expression of growth promoter genes. Wilms' tumour is one example of a disease that has been shown to be affected by these deviations indirectly, but simple genetic differences can also contribute to its formation.<br /><br />Wilms' tumour is a form of pediatric kidney cancer, and is associated with overexpression of H19/Igf2 and hypermethylation of the imprint control region, likely because of loss of parent-of-origin specific imprinting and euchromatin aberrations. Specifically, on the maternal allele, H19 is deactivated and Igf2 is activated precisely as they are on the paternal allele. This encourages cellular growth, which is the mechanism by which cancer is promoted.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA-demethylating agents, such as the cytidine analogs azacitidine and decitabine have an antitumour effect, and as a result are used in chemotherapy treatment for cancer (as well as other diseases). By inhibiting DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), it causes the removal of DNA methylation marks, which is one of the pathways by which it is useful as a chemotherapeutic drug.<br /><br />More recently, combinations of drugs that affect epigenetic state have been under scrutiny to find out if they have synergistic effects, meaning that they are more effective combined than would be expected based on their combined individual efficacies. The cytidine analogs such as Decitabine have in fact been shown to be effective in late-stage lung cancer when combined with a histone deactylase inhibitor. The working hypothesis is that the cytidine analogs and HDAIs together make cancerous cells more susceptible to other chemotherapeutic drugs.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is heritable, but even ignoring this heritable effect, changes in DNA methylation can affect three different generations. For instance, when a pregnant woman suffers a methylation shock (such as exposure to a DNA methylation suppressor such as bisphenol A), it is not only herself that can be affected, but also her baby and the reproductive cells of that baby. The simultaneous existence of cells that are important for the health of the pregnant woman's granddaughter, daughter and herself ensures that there exists a single point (here: period) of failure that does not work through heritability.<br /><br />If the chemical exposure described above happens during a sensitive period, such as a period of heavy epigenetic reprogramming of her progeny, this non-heritable effect is most likely to be manifested in the way described. A sensitive period is a period in which higher than normal sensitivity exists to these epigenetic mechanisms.<br /><br />Because of this vulnerable state, epigenetic shocks from outside should be avoided during these periods, as disease states have found to be associated with them as explained in the previous questions and answers.<br /></div>
