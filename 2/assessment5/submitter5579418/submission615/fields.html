    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is usually low in normal
cells to allow for tumour suppressor gene expression. During cancer, CpG
islands become methylated, which increases with cancer progression, and leads
to decreased expression of tumour suppressor genes. Intergenic regions and
repetitive elements are normally hypermethylated to prevent genome instability
and prevent oncogene transcription. When normal cells become cancerous, both
intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated, with
hypomethylation increasing with tumour progression. Hypomethylation of
intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability, which
contributes to cancer by possibility activating cryptic or alternative
promoters or activation or silencing of neighbouring genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele is usually methylated at the imprint control region (ICR), which blocks H19 expression. Since H19 expression is blocked, the enhancer elements are expressed, which act to express Igf2. On the maternal allele, the ICR is bound by an insulator element that prevents methylation of H19, thus allowing H19 expression. H19 expression blocks expression of the enhancer elements and therefore the Igf2 gene is silent. In Wilm's tumour, both the paternal and maternal alleles are hypermethylated, which results in an over-expression of the growth promoter gene Igf2. The increased expression of the growth-promoting Igf2 gene causes excessive growth, and thus leads to Wilm's tumour.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), and causes the inhibition of DNA methylation. Exceessive DNA methylation in cancer cells may lead to the silencing of tumour suppressor genes, thus allowing the increased proliferation observed in cancer. Use of a DNMTi to treat cancer cells may inhibit the methylation of tumour suppressor genes, thus allowing tumour suppressor gene expression and a reduction in cell growth. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altered DNA methylation may have lasting effects on the epigenome if the laying down or removal of epigenetic marks is performed during sensitive periods of development. A sensitive period of development is when epigenetic reprogramming occurs, that is when epigenetic marks are cleared and reset. Sensitive periods of development include early development (from the fertlised egg to blastocyst stage) and primordial germ cell development. Treating a patient with an epigenetic drug during a sensitive period may result in appropriate epigenetic marks being set during development, for example silencing or activation of the inappropriate maternal or paternal allele which can result in the offspring suffering from disease.<br /></div>
