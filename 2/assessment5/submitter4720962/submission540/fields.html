    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer involves mistakes in genetics and
epigenetics. Epigenetic changes occur frequently because they are mitotically
inheritable and epimutations are rapidly selected, but reversible and less
stable than genetics alterations; so, hypermethylation is often more frequent
that mutations in cancer. </p>

<p>CpGs are usually hypomethylated or not too
methylated, and that permits the normal transcription of genes. However, in
cancer, CpG islands and CpG islands shores (2kb regions surrounding CpG
islands) are hypermethylated, going to CIMP (CpG island methilator phenotype). This
fact causes silencing of the underlying genes (Hassler and Eggle, 2012). </p>

<p>The methylation is an alternative to genetic
mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer (that control cell
cycle, DNA repair, apoptosis…). Besides, it causes genomic instability and
desregulation of tissue specific genes. In fact, DNA replication depends on
epigenetics mechanism, such DNA methylation, so an altered state contributes to
stress in cells and changes in intrinsic signals (Hassler and Egger, 2012).</p>

<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in
the wide-genome are under normal conditions methylated. Intragenic
methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as remnants of retroviral
insertions such as SINEs and LINEs in human DNA and satellite repeats (Hassler and Egger, 2012). In
cancer, those regions are desmethylated, and that is the reason because the
global level of methylation decreases with cancer. This occurs to some degree in
all tumour type tested. This hypomethylated state cause instability, because
permits illegitimate recombination between repeats, activations of repeats and
trsansposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring
genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, there is a DNA
methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding (an insulator protein). Without CTCF, DNA
methylation spreads to <i>H19 </i>promoter to silence
(not transcribed) and enhancers can access <i>Igf2 </i>to
activate. On the other hand, in the maternal allele, CTCF insulates <i>Igf2 </i>from
downstream enhancers<span>.
So, there is no expression there of <i>lgf2</i>,
because there is expression of <i>H19</i> </span>(Blewitt,
2014).</p>

<p><span>In cancer cells there are a loss of imprinting:
in Wilm’s tumour, paternal and maternal alleles expressed <i>Igf2</i>, because none of them express <i>H19</i> (it is methylated). So, the </span><span>hypermethylation
of ICR contributes to <i>Igf2</i>
overexpression in Wilm’s tumour (Blewitt, 2014).</span></p>

<p>This disrupte of
the imprinting contributes to cancer because alterations in DNA methylation at
ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting
genes, and overexpression of growth promoting genes (Blewitt, 2014). In other
words, the cycle cell is modified, and the cell divide more rapidly.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (sold as Dacogen) belongs to DNMTI
(DNA methyl transpherase inhibitor), and it is a DNA-demethylating agent. The
recruitment of DNMT, or the presence of DNMTI, might be a mechanism for de novo
methylation of the DNA in embryonic stem cells; however it appears nonessencial
for maintance of methylation in differentiated cells (Hassler and Egger, 2012).
The drug is used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome progressed to
acute myelod leukemia (AML). In that syndrome, there are described mutations associated with DNA methylation (especially DNMT3, TET
proteins) (Hassler and Egger, 2012). As hassle and Egger say (2012), ‘The
family of TET proteins has been implicated in DNA demethylation in ES cells and is
frequently found mutated in myeloid disorders’.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When someone uses drugs that alter the DNA
methylation pattern, they affect to the cycle cell, affect the activation of
some genes… and these have effects on the response to chemotherapy. Because those
changes are mitotically inheritable, if the mistakes are erased, they will not
return. Many of the genes affected in cancer, in fact, are involved in
regulation.</p>

<p>We define a sensitive period as the time when
the epigenetics marks are established rather than maintenance (when epigenetic reprogramming
occurs). This period occurs in blastocyst phase and in primordial or embryonic germ
cells. Consequently, younger patients need to consider the effect on germ cells
if they used these types of epigenetic drugs (Blewiit, 2014). </p><p>REFERENCES:</p>
