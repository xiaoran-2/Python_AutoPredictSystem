    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, only the paternal allele of IGF2 is active, while the maternal allele is inactive. This is known as "imprinting". The H19 on the paternal allele has been methylated, disabling the CTCF insulator, allowing expression of the paternal IGF2. However, the maternal allele is inactive because it has the CTCF protein binding in the region between the H19 region and the IGF2 promoter, disallowing the expression of the maternal IGF2. However, </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the H19/IGF2 cluster is disrupted because the maternal H19 region also is methylated. This disables the maternal CTCF insulator, causing the maternal IGF2 to also be expressed. The IGF2 gene is a growth promoter, so its overexpression can contribute to cancer.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to inhibit gene expression. CpG islands are typically located near the start of the transcription area of genes, so DNA methylation in this area disables the transcription from starting.</p><p>








</p><p>In cancer, disrupting DNA methylation of CpG islands can activate oncogenes (genes that may be involved in causing cancer) or silence tumor suppressing genes. This can contribute to cancers.</p><p>Normally, there are DNA methylation in the repetitive elements. Disruption can cause repetitions to be silenced or overexpressed, contributing to cancers. It is still unclear why there is methylation in the intergenic region.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an hypomethylating agent (at lower doses), inhibiting DNA methylation. In cancers where tumor suppressor genes has ben silenced due to aberrant DNA methylation, Decitabine can allow re-expression of these tumor suppressor genes, promoting suppression of tumor growth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome by being passed on in mitosis (cell division). I'd would avoid treating early stage pregnant woman as it may affect the developing zygote during sensitive periods, times when there are extensive epigenetic reprogramming. Also, it might be advisable to avoid treating people that plan to have children, as well as treating youth in early puberty, as we've learned that this is a potentially sensitive period due to development of their gametes (egg/sperm), with epigenetic effects potentially affecting their children and grandchildren.</p></div>
