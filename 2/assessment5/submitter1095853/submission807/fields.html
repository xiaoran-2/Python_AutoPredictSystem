    <div class="field-value"><b>1. </b>The normal methylation of DNA is done at the CpG dinucleotids, symmetrically, and it is maintained during cell division. <br />The methylation of the normal CpG dinuleotides is started by the methyltransferases DNMT3a/3b and is maintained by DNMT1. <br />The normal cell has CpG islands usually unmethylated.<br /><div>The CpG dinucleotides near the promoter of a gene are protected from methylation.<br /><b>2. </b>In cancer, the CpG island and the CpG islands shores near the promoter of genes show hypermethylation, which will determine silencing of the respective promoter (including tumor supressor genes). <div>The DNA methylation is mutagenic, becuase it's easy for methylated Cytosine to be deaminated into Thymine, therefore changing the correct nucleotide with a mutated one.<br /></div><div><b>3. </b>The hypermethylated CpG islands in the promoters of the tumor supressors genes will determine the silencing of those genes,  which may cause of the cancer. <br />The pattern of hypermethylated DNA is mitotically heritable to the following generation of cancer cell.<br />The CpG islands hypermethylation characteristic is more frequent than DNA mutations, which is another cause of cancer. <br />The different locations of hypermethylated CpG islands will cause different types of cancer.</div><div>There are cancers which show only one hypermethylated CpG island location, like the BRCA1 in breast cancer.</div><div>The intensity of hypermethylation is associated with tumorigenicity.<br /><b>4. </b>The normal cell has intergenic regions and repetitive elements usually methylated with the physiological purposes of maintaining genomic integrity: for the IGR to silence the cryptic transcription start sites and for the repetitive elements to silence the repeats. </div><div><b>5. </b>In all cancers, it's shown a genome wide hypomethylation, including hypomethylation for intergenic regions repeats, and genomic instability.<br /></div><div>The hypomethylation is mitotically heritable. <br /><b>6.</b> The IGR/repeats hypomethylation contributes to cancer through genomic instability.<br />The effects of hypomethylation depend on location: repeats/ Intergenic regions will show genomic instability and the CpG poor promoters will show oncogene activation.</div></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In the early development of PGC takes place the epigenetic reprogramming with the active demethylation of paternal genome, the passive demethylation of the maternal genome, the genomic imprinting of the genes (monoallelic gene expression-only one allele will be expressed). <br />The expression of imprinted genes is controlled by ICRs.<div>The normal allele has the H19 hypomethylated, with absent expression of IGf2.<br />The allele that carries the hypermethylated H19  in the H19/Igf2 cluster, has the DNA methylation at ICR blocks the binding of insulator protein CTCF to bind and the enhancers can go to Igf2 to activate it an to express it.<b><br /></b>The Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome has also the pathological expression of the maternal allele, instead of silencing it, it is also expressed, including the H19/Igf2 cluster. The maternal allele is acting like the paternal allele, causing a uni-parental disomy. <b><br /><br />Methylation-paternal allele</b>. If the paternal allele carries the H19/Igf2 cluster, then it expresses the Igf2.<br /><div><b><br />Methylation-maternal allele. </b>The normal maternal allele should have the H19 and CTFC active, protecting the igf2 from enhacers, with an absent expression of Igf2. The Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome maternal allele has Igf2 expression present.<div><br />For the <b>Wilm’s tumour, </b>the Igf2 has over-expression, with both alleles having the H19 hypermethylated.<div><b><br />Cancer. </b>The H19/Igf2 cluster include upregulation of the oncogene Igf2 therefore contributing to cancer.</div></div></div></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The treatment of cancer patients with drugs that alter the DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically  heritable, ensuring that the same genes are passed down to the daughter cell. <br /><b><br />A sensitive period</b> is when altered environments (diet, maternal care, chemical exposure) have an effect on the epigenetic control, which means that a developing embryo must not be voluntarily exposed to  any such factors, in order to maintain the normal epigenetic reprogramming and genome imprinting processes. <div><br /></div>Examples of sensitive periods is when the epigenetic reprogramming takes place: <br />- during the <b>pre-implantation period</b>/<b>early development of the embryo </b>(until blastocyst) and <br />- during <b>primordial germ cell </b><b>development</b>.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because it may interfere with the normal growth of the respective developing embryo (interfering with the epigenetic reprogramming and genomic imprinting) and for the future generations (mid-gestation embryo, through transgenerational epigenetic inheritance).</div>
