    <h1>Submission 467 from Anon (session_user_id: 3247306d4f780eef0bf5fc0f38f0093e9c200fe7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent and is being used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which are precursors of myelogenous leukaemia.It is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and binds to DNMT preventing its action. Due to this it acts on cells that are actively dividing and thus has a greater effect on rapidly dividing cancer cells than on normal tissue. In low doses Decitabine has an anti-neoplastic effect by causing demethylation. Other DNMTis have been shown to have an increased therapeutic effect when used with HDACis and also have been shown to increase the effectiveness of normal chemotherapeutic drugs. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands normally silences gene expression.The primary function is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure and the secondary function is to prohibit transcription binding factors and thus alter gene expresssion. In cancer cells CpG islands are hypermethylated meaning they are excessively methylated when compared to normal cells. The hypermethylation of CpG islands results in the failure to silence tumour suppressor genes, these cells will thus proliferate as the methylation is mitotically heritable leading to a proliferation of cancer cells over normal cells. The hypermethylation of particular CpG islands has been found to be associated with particular cancers and can thus be used diagnostically e.g. <i>BRCA1 in breast cancer.</i><i></i> Hypermethylation of CpG islands increases as the cancer develops as the total methylation of tissue decreases. <br />Methylation of repeats and intergenic regions is essential to prevent incorrect recombination In cancer cells DNA methylation in intergenic regions becomes reduced, hypomethylation, this causes genomic instability and removal of tissue specific methylation. In correct recombinations can increase and repeats and transposons can be activated as can cryptic promoters and neighbouring genes due to loss of methylation which allows previously silenced genes to be expressed. Also there is and increase in the number of deletions and insertions during mitosis. Activation of miRNAs due to hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can lead to reduction in tumour suppressor gene activation, e.g. <em>miR21 </em>targets the tumour suppressor <em>PTEN</em> this miRNA is activated in glioma. <em></em></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the <em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster of a normal cell there is a difference in methylation of the imprint control region (ICR) between paternal and maternal alleles. The maternal allele has an unmethylated ICR which is bound by CTCF, the rsult of which is to allow the enhancers to act on the <em>H19 </em>gene and thus<em> Igf2 </em>on the maternal allele is not expressed. On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and as such CTCF does not bind to it, <em>H19</em> is methylated and the enhancers act on <em>Igf2</em> which is thus expressed. In Wilm's tumour the maternal allele also has methylation of the ICR which causes this allele to also express <em>Igf2</em> and not <em>H19</em>. As <em>Igf2</em> is a growth promoter its over expression is a cause of the excedssive growth of cells associated with Wilm's tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic effects are by their definition mitotically heritable, thus the changes in methylation caused by epigenetic drugs will themselves be mitotically heritable. Use of epigenetic drugs would be unsafe during the sensitive periods; these are the periods when epigenetic marks are being removed and reset they occur during early development from fretilisation until epiblast and during primordial germ cell development where epigentic marks are removed and gamete specific marks are added. The use of either drugs that increase methylation or decrease methylation would be inadvisable during these periods as they would result in incorrect epigenetic marks being added or removed. Thus it would be inappropriate to use epigenetic drugs on pregnant women and it would be inadvisable for people being treated with these drugs to attempt to have children. Also wary in using these drugs on younger patients with developing germ cells.</div>
