    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Normally, the H19/Igf2 region undergoes
imprinting on the paternal allele. The ICR of the paternal allele is
methylated, which inhibits binding of CTCF. This allows spreading of DNA
methylation to the H19 promoter, silencing H19 expression. The enhancer can now
promote expression of Igf2. Since the ICR is not methylated on the maternal
allele CTCF can bind here and spreading of DNA methylation is blocked. Now the
enhancer is able to promote expression of H19 and expression of Igf2 is
blocked. In Wilm’s tumor H19/Igf2 imprinting is disrupted by either a
mutation/deletion resulting in loss of imprinting or by uniparental disomy (the
individual inherited two copies of the paternal allele). Both result in
increased expression of Igf2. Since Igf2 is growth promoting and known to be an
oncogene the disruption of imprinting contributes to cancer progression via
upregulation of Igf2.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a chemical analogue of cytidine
that incorporated into the DNA during replication. It causes hypomethylation by
inhibiting DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). DNMT1 is responsible for the
maintenance of DNA methylation after cell division. Treatment with Decitabine
therefore inhibits the methylation of DNA after each cell division. This
results in demethylation of the DNA. If a promoter of a tumor suppressor gene
is repressed because it is methyled, Decitabine can remove the methylation
during cell divisions. Over time this results in demethylation of the promoter
of the tumor suppressor gene and expression of this gene. Exploiting this
mechanism, Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have an
effect beyond the period of treatment, because DNA methylation is mitotically
inheritable, meaning it is passed on to the daughter cells after each cell
division. If you remove methylgroups using a demethylating drug these
methylgroups will not return after cell division. However, this heritability of
DNA methylation does not apply to the sensitive periods of development. These
periods are times during which the DNA is demethylated (epigenetic
reprogramming) and occur during early development (pre-implantation period) and
primordial germ cell development. Treating patients with drugs that alter DNA
methylation during these sensitive periods is inadvisable, because the
epigenome is being reset and any chance you make with the drug will be deleted.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands are protected from methylation and
genes are transcribed, but if a CpG island is methylated this results in
silencing of gene expression. The methylated CpG can bind proteins that have a
transcriptional repression domain and help in repressing transcription. In
cancer there is often deregulation of DNA methylation, resulting in DNA
hypermethylation of CpG islands and also the CpG island shores (2kb regions on
each side of the CpG island. This often occurs for genes with tumor suppressive
functions. This results in inhibition of the expression of tumor suppressor
genes, which promotes tumor growth.</p>

<p>Intergenic regions and reptitive elements are usually
methylated in healthy cells to maintain genomic stability. If these regions are
demethylated, as often seen in cancer (global hypomethylation), this leads to
genomic instability as a result of translocations, deletions, insertions,
transpositions and recombinations. These can all result in induction of
expression/upregulation of oncogenes and inhibition/down regulation of tumor
suppressor genes, together contributing to cancer development and progression</p>

<p>The alterations in DNA mehylation, which falls in the
category of so called epimutations, are mitotically heritable and therefore
stay in the cell population. These epimutations often occur through alterations
in the epigenetic machinery, including mutations, overexpression,
amplification, translocation and silencing (through hypermethylation) of
epigentic regulators like EZH2, UTX, etc.</p></div>
