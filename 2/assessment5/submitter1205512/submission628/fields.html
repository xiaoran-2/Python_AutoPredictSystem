    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an inactive
epigenetic mark.  In mammals, DNA
methylation is almost always found at CpG dinucleotides.<br /><br />CpG islands are regions of DNA which
have a higher concentration of CpG dinucleotides than you would expect by
chance.  CpG islands are often found at
the promoters of genes.  CpG islands are
rarely methylated, and when they are methylated, this is almost universally
synonymous with silencing of gene expression.



<p>Hypermethylation of
CpG islands and genome-wide hypomethylation are found in every tumor type that has
been examined for these hallmarks of cancer.<br /></p>

<p>In normal cells, CpG islands are
generally unmethylated.  In cancer, CpG
islands at specific loci (often associated with tumor-suppressor genes) are
heavily methylated.  Methylation of CpG
islands is strongly associated with silencing. 
Methylation of the CpG islands associated with tumor-suppressors is
likely to silence those tumor-suppressors. 
If tumor-suppressors are not expressed, tumors are more likely to grow
and spread.  Hypermethylation of the CpG
islands associated with tumor suppressors is strongly associated with cancer.</p>

<p>In normal cells,
intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be heavily methylated. Hypomethylation
of repeats and intergenic regions is strongly correlated with genomic
instability – loss of chromosomes, addition of chromosomes, and illegitimate
recombinations may occur.  Hypomethylated
repeats can jump around in the genome, disrupting genes they may jump into.  Promoters associated with repeats can disrupt
transcription of nearby genes.  Hypomethylation
of repeats and intergenic regions is strongly correlated with cancer.</p><p><br /></p><p><span>The information in this response came from Dr. Blewitt's lectures.<br /></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster
includes the gene for Igf2, the imprint-control region for the cluster, and the
gene for H19.  Beyond H19 are enhancers
that can work on either Igf2 or H19.  The
imprint-control region in the H19/Igf2 cluster is generally methylated on the
paternal allele, but unmethylated on the maternal allele. <br /><br />When the ICR is methylated
(as is usual for the paternal allele), H19 tends to be methylated as well,
suppressing expression of H19.  The
enhancers reach beyond H19, past the ICR, all the way to Igf2, enhancing its
expression.

<p>When the ICR is
unmethylated (as is usual for the maternal allele), H19 is unmethylated, and
can be expressed.  In addition, CTCF can
bind to an unmethylated ICR, which blocks the enhancers from affecting
Igf2.  The enhancers work on H19, and
Igf2 remains silent.</p><p>Igf2
is a growth promoter.  Over-expression of
growth promoters is a hallmark of cancer.</p>

<p>Sometimes the
maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele (the ICR is methylated, H19 is
suppressed, and Igf2 is expressed).  If Igf2 is expressed on both parental alleles, this
over-expression of Igf2 can result in Wilm’s tumor.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase
inhibitor. <br /><p><span>DNA methyltransferase is necessary for
maintenance of DNA methylation marks during cell division.  In the absence of DNA methyltransferase, DNA
will be progressively less methylated with each cell division.  DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are not specific to any particular loci.  They can affect any methylated regions of the epigenome.<br /></span></p>

<p>Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor
genes is one of the important keys to tumor formation.  If Decitabine can reverse inappropriate
hypermethylation of tumor suppressors, those tumor-suppressor genes can be
expressed, making it harder for tumors to form and spread.  <br /></p><p>Decitabine's action will not be limited to inappropriately-methylated DNA.  It is not unlikely that some appropriate methylation of DNA, genome-wide, will be lost as a result of treatment with Decitabine.<br /></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Once it is
laid down (or removed), DNA methylation (or lack thereof) is mitotically
heritable.  The fact that DNA methylation
in a parent cell is normally replicated in the daughter cells means DNA methylation can be very stable over the life
of an organism.<br /><p>Sensitive
periods are times when cells are most susceptible to environmental
influences.  </p>

<p>The most
typical examples of sensitive periods are primordial germ cell development and
early embryonic development (pre-implantation), but there can be other
sensitive periods, as seen in effects of mothering style on infant rats (those
effects are set in infancy, but last a lifetime).</p>

<p>Inhibition
of the epigenetic machinery would be a very large environmental influence.  Receiving drugs that inhibit the epigenetic
machinery at a time when epigenetic marks are being laid down, or are being
removed, could have deleterious effects on a developing embryo, and/or on the children that may eventually result from that embryo's primordial germ cells.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><span>The information in this response came from Dr. Blewitt's lectures.<br /></span></p>
