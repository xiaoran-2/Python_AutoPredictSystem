    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration of DNA methylation is characteristic of cancer
cells. DNA CpG Island methylation can be contrasted with DNA methylation in
intergenic regions and repetitive elements as examples of some alterations.</p>

<p> In normal cells, CpG Islands are typically unmethylated,
although about 6% become methylated in a tissue specific manner during
development or in differentiated tissue. Most CGIs are sites for transcription
initiation, with many remote from promoters.</p>

<p> In tumour cells, many tumour suppressor genes are silenced
via CpG Island methylation.Since about 60% of gene promoters are associated with a CpG
Island, change in methylation levels of any CGI has an impact on potential
cancer development.</p>

<p>By silencing key regulatory genes, such as tumour suppressor
genes, DNA methylation is the epigenetic equivalent of mutation/deletion in
oncogenesis. DNA methylation of CGIs can heritably silence genes whose promoters are associated
with CpG Islands. When this occurs in the promoter regions of normal cells it
can act as one of the steps in the Knudson 'two-hit' model of tumour formation</p>

<p> In contrast to CGIs, normal intergenic regions and
repetitive elements are highly methylated. This methylation contributes to
formation of heterochromatic structure of their genomic loci and explains why
they are often transciptionally silent.</p>

<p> Cancer disrupts this methylation pattern, and results in
genome wide hypomethylation and genomic instability. The normally condensed
heterochromatin of the intergenetic regions and repetitive elements becomes
open and subject to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of
repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruptions
to neighboring genes.</p>

<p> Because this genome wide instability is initiated by
epigenetic mechanisms, it is mitotically heritable, and is preserved in the
cell lineage to potentially contribute to cancerous tumour growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can result in both suppression of
growth restricting genes and over expression of growth promoting genes,
contributing to cancer. ICR disruption can be from either hypomethylation or
hypermethylation. </p>

<p>We can use hypermethylation of the ICR in the H19/lgf2
cluster as an example of imprinting disruption. In normal maternal cells, a
CTCF insulator binds the ICR so it is unmethylated. Enhancers then act on H19
and it is expressed, with downstream lgf2 blocked and silenced. In contrast,
the normal paternal cell has the ICR methylated, so the enhancers act on lgf2
and it is expressed with H19 silenced.<br /></p>

<p> In abnormal cells, both maternal and paternal ICRs are
methylated, meaning both lgf2 genes are expressed by the enhancers. Since lgf2
is growth promoting, the result is double the growth factor expressed,
resulting in Wilm's tumour cancer, a childhood kidney tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and acts by
reactivating epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor genes. It is an analogue
to the nucleoside 2'-deoxycytidine.</p>

<p> Cells exposed to Decitabine incorporate it into DNA during
replication and RNA during transcription. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase,
the enzyme responsible for methylating newly synthesized DNA in mammalian
cells. This results in hypomethylation of DNA.</p>

<p> Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect because
non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to Decitabine. Tumour cells
rapidly proliferate, and readily incorporate Decitabine during S phase,
resulting in cell specific apoptosis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altered DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
epigenome because DNA methylation is a primary epigenetic mechanism. It is the
source for many mechanisms including imprinting, X chromosome inactivation,
transcription factors, and heterochromatin formation. The list of mechanisms is
extensive. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Altered DNA methylation is
found in a broad spectrum of cancer types, and includes both hypomethylation
and hypermethylation.. </p>

<p>Mammalian DNA methylation patterns are established during
sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming,
and start at fertilization and early embryonic development, continuing to
primordial germ cell development. 
Dramatic reprogramming of methylation levels occurs during
gametogenesis, fertilization, and development of the zygote, embryo, and
placenta.<br /></p>

<p> Treating patients during sensitive periods would be
inadvisable because sensitive periods are when altered environments have an
effect on laying down or removal of epigenetic marks. Since exposure during
these periods of epigenetic vulnerability can impact epigenetic state, the
resulting epigenetic marks can be stably maintained in cell lineages to
influence disease susceptibility years later.</p></div>
