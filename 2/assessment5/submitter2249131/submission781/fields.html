    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to gene silencing and it's a key epigenetic process. It enables transcriptional regulation, establishment of chromatin structure and imprinting, among many others. This mechanism is disrupted in cancer since CpG islands show aberrant methylation. Thus, hypomethylation of genes such as oncogenes can facilitate the or hypermethylation of tumor supressor gene can facilitate the cancer development.<br />Regarding intergenic regions (wihich are found in between coding genes) and repetitive elements, the key point is maybe the disregulation of piRNA expression and its relationship with hypomethilation os repeats. However, the mechanism by which this occur it is not clear.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Expression of Igf2 controlled by its imprint control region (ICR), the methylation of which is established in primordial germ cells. Cancer is related in this process given that loss of DNA methylation at ICRs, is common in this disease. <br /><br />The Wilm's tumour is related to a loss of imprinting and overexpression of growth promoting genes ( a situation also found in many types of cancer). This gives a predisosition of the tumour to be developed in the childhood but not in the adulthood. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. Though its mechanism of action is unclear, it lacks specificity. It acts by hypomethylating gene promoters and thus reactivating tumour supressor genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">This effect is probably due to the fact that <span>epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and the following cells until they are selectively eliminated, and once erased, of course, they don't return. <br />A sensitive period is a moment during which tre is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms, for example during developmental periods such as the perinatal period. Given this, it wouldn't be advisable treating patients with this kind of drugs, since they might have long lasting effects throug the regulatory epigenetic effects.<br /><br /></span></div>
