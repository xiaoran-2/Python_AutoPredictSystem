    <div class="field-value">DNA Methylation plays an important role in cancer epigenetics. It has been seen that methylation pattern of DNA is altered in cancer. This has been explained below, taking in view the CpG Islands and repetitive elements and intergenic region.<br />CpG Islands are found in the promoter regions of some genes and normally, they are hypomethylated so that the gene is expressed. However, in cancer cells, there is hypermethylation of CpG Islands.This change of methylation from hypo to hyper may lead to cancer. The CpG Islands are present in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes( i.e. genes that are responsible for checking the tumor growth). Once these promoters are hypermethylated, the gene becomes inactive because the DNA becomes tightly packed. Therefore, the transcription factors cannot interact with the promoter to transcribe these genes(as it is locked down in silent state). <br />The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally hypermethylated. The methylation of these regions is important so that they are maintained in an inactive state and this contributes to genomic stability. However in cancer, these regions become hypomethylated. Due to low levels of methylation(which leads to euchromatisation), these repetitive elements are available for recombination which may also be illegitimate and can cause erroneous chromosomal translocation. Also, the repeats will gain the ability to make copies of themselves and transpose. This can have bad consequences as these can jump into the coding region of the gene thus disrupting it or, may activate the neighboring genes and cause atypical activity of that gene. This increased genomic instability may lead to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Cancer cells show loss of imprinting(i.e. in cancer, some genes that should normally show monoallelic expression, start showing either expression from both alleles or become silent from both of the parental alleles). Although there can be either hypermethylation or hypomethylation of the imprint control region(ICR) depending on the function of the gene involved, we are going to take the example of <span> H19/Igf2 cluster which shows hypermethylation at it's ICR.<br /></span>Normally, the ICR on paternal allele of the  H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated  and is unmethylated on maternal allele. CTCF(an insulator element) binds the unmethylated ICR of maternal allele and insulates Igf2 from downstrean enhancers thus blocking the expression of <span>Igf2 from maternal allele. However due to methylation of ICR on paternal allele, CTCF does not binds and enhancers are able to promote expression of Igf2 from paternal allele. <br />In case of Wilm's tumor, ICR of the maternal allele is also methylated thus, leading to expression of Igf2 from both paternal as well as maternal alleles. As Igf2 is a growth promoting protein, double dose of Igf2 leads to cancer as seen in case of Wilm's tumor.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><pre></pre><code></code>Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitor class. Decitabine is, chemically, a nucleoside analog. During cell replication, these analogs are incorporated into the DNA. These analogs bind DNA methytransferases irreversibly, thus trapping the enzyme and causing loss of activity which ultimately leads to hypomethylation. <br />However, these drugs act only when the cell replicates and we know that cancer cells replicate faster than normal cells, therefore only cancer cells are more severely affected. Cancer cells are associated with hypermethylation at CpG Islands. So, these drugs act against cancer by inhibiting the methylating activity of DNA methyltransferases.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment. This is because these drugs target the epigenetic machinery of cell. We know that epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable. So, even after a patient is off these drugs for a long time, the effects caused by that drug can be seen. However, we also know that these epigenetic marks are removed during sensitive periods. Sensitive periods means a period during which the previous epigenetic marks are being erased and new ones are being set(i.e. epigenetic reprogramming). These sensitive periods occur at preimplantation period of embryo during early development and during primordial germ cell development. So, patients should be advised to stop taking these drugs during these sensitive periods because these drugs will affect every cell of the body and will disrupt the laying down of the normal epigenetic marks which is very crucial for cell development. </div>
