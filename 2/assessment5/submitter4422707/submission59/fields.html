    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine
is an FDA approved drug indicated for the treatment of myelodysplastic
syndrome, a hematological malignancy where myeloid (blood-forming) cells are damaged. Myelodysplastic syndrome can progress to acute myeloid
leukemia.<br /><br /></span>Decitabine treats cancer by functioning as a<b> DNA methyltransferase inhibitor</b> (DNMTi).
As a <b>nucleoside analogue</b>, it is incorporated into DNA during replication and DNA
methyltransferase binds to it. Decitabine then inhibits its activity by causing <strong>demethylation</strong>, making DNA
methyltransferase <b>irreversible</b>. The cancer cells stop growing because
Decitabine adversely affects the way that cell regulatory proteins (tumor suppressor genes) are able to bind to DNA methyltransferase. DNMT inhibitors
have a greater effect on cancer cells since they replicate more than normal
cells. But since Decitabine is NOT a targeted therapy, and is essentially toxic
to all the cells (including normal cells), it is more effective to induce
de-methylation at lower doses to have an <strong>anti-tumor effect</strong>. In this way,
Decitabine can also effectively reactivate epigenetically silent tumor suppressor genes, so that normal blood count is restored.<span><br /> </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is a genetic disease that's caused not only by
genetic mutations, but also by disturbances in the individual’s epigenome due
to aberrations in DNA methylation. DNA methylation is maintained by a DNA
methyltransferase enzyme known as DNMT1, and <u>in particular instances</u>,
DNMT1 is needed for genomic stability.</p>

<p></p><p> CpG islands’ normal function is to influence chromatin structure, and simplify regulation of gene
expression. CpG islands are <u>generally <b>unmethylated</b></u>
in normal cells.  In
particular, CpG islands are found in or near the <b><u>promoter regions of tumor</u></b> <b><u>suppressor genes.</u></b> These genes control the rate at which
cells divide. When unmethylated, CpG islands allow transcription factors to
bind to these promoter regions. </p><p>Since DNA methylation
is an inactive epigenetic mark, if the CpG islands become <b><u>methylated</u></b>, transcription factors cannot bind; these tumor suppressor genes are then
<strong>silenced</strong>, and their inactivity will lead to <strong>uncontrollable cell growth</strong>. Cancer is marked by <b>hypermethylation </b>of CpG islands which results in a loss of function of tumor suppressor genes.</p><p> For example, CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is a tumor type
that's quite frequently observed in colorectal cancers (including hereditary
non-polyposis colorectal cancer), where there is <b>hypermethylation</b> of the promoter
of the MLH1 gene (a DNA repair gene). In these types of cancers, there is an
epimutation of MLH1, because it is silenced by CpG island hypermethylation.</p>

<p>But while DNA methylation <u>rarely</u> occurs at CpG
islands in normal cells, it <u>mostly occurs</u> at repetitive
elements and intergenic regions in order to protect the genome from instability.
<b><u>Hypomethylation</u></b> at repetitive
elements and intergenic regions creates transposition,  transcription of neighboring genes, illegitimate
recombinations between repeats, and  transcriptional interference.  In normal cells which have DNMT1, (and hence heterochromatin), DNA methylation serves to silence these repeats and
intergenic regions, so that normal cells do not become cancerous. Cancer is
detailed by euchromatin, where chromosomal deletions, insertions of pieces of
chromosomes, duplications of whole chromosomes (copy number variations), gene amplification, and
reciprocal translocations take place between chromosomes as a result of global-wide <b>hypomethylation</b>.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are originally found in the placenta, and many
are involved in controlling growth in embryonic tissue, and in preventing
cancer. These genes are expressed in a <u>parent-of-origin</u> specific manner.
This <u>mono-allelic expression</u> is disrupted in <u>childhood cancers</u> by
<b>alterations in DNA</b> <b>methylation</b> at ICRs (imprint control
regions).</p><p> At the H19/IGf2
cluster on chromosome 11, IGf2 is an imprinted gene that is expressed only from
the paternal allele.  <u>H19 is always
expressed from the maternal allele </u>because its ICR has a CTCF insulator
binding region that is <b><u>un-methylated</u></b>;
this <b>un-methylated</b> state <u>allows</u>
this insulator protein to bind, enabling only expression of HI9, and <u>blocking
the expression of IGf2</u> by downstream enhancers.</p>

<p>On the paternal allele, <b><u>DNA
methylation</u></b> at the paternal ICR <u>prevents</u> the CTCF insulator
protein from binding, so that downstream enhancers are free to turn on the
paternal IGf2 promoter, and so <u>IGf2 is always expressed</u>. DNA methylation allows heterochromatin to
spread to the nearby promoter of H19, so <u>H19 is always silenced</u>.</p>

<span>The
importance of <b>DNA methylation</b> in governing</span> allelic imprinting is seen in <u>Wilm’s tumor</u>, where there
is a <b>loss of imprinting of IGf2</b>,
because the maternal ICR becomes methylated just like the paternal ICR,
resulting in an <b>overexpression of</b> <b>IGf2</b>. IGf2 is growth-promoting, so when it is overexpressed, this leads to overgrowth/increased risk of cancer.<p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A drug which targets an enzymatic epigenetic regulator would
disrupt the individual’s epigenetic state by having a long-term effect on periods
of epigenetic reprogramming. This is what is termed <strong>sensitive periods</strong>, because
this is when there is clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks, which are
then maintained for the lifetime of the organism.</p>

<p>It would therefore be inadvisable to administer Decitabine to
younger female patients: <u>during
the period of </u><u>childhood
through puberty</u><span>
(considering the germ line), including <u>any period pre-conception/conception</u>. This
is because Decitabine is already a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, so
any remaining cells void of DNMT1 would be further demethylated.</span> </p>

<p>After <strong>primordial germ cell development</strong>, oocytes undergo
resetting at a different rate than spermatogenesis because they mature a little
later than sperm, in terms of lifespan. Oocytes remain in a haploid
demethylated state until puberty. If Decitabine is administered, it would alter oocyte production, as well as alter expression of maternal effect proteins which are
needed to bind to imprint control regions in the placenta, in order to
maintain methylation of imprinted genes through <strong>early embryonic</strong> <strong>development</strong>.</p>If Decitabine is administered pre-conception, the second long-term effect would be seen during
the first phase of epigenetic reprogramming (<strong>early post-fertilization</strong>), where the maternal genome becomes passively demethylated, because there's replication taking place independent of DNMT1, which is excluded from the nucleus.<br /><br /><br /></div>
