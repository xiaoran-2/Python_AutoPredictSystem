    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands functions to silence genes by causing changes in the structure of the DNA, thus affecting the transcription of a gene. In cancer, DNA hypermethylation that occurs at CpG islands in the genome that normally would not be methylated can silence tumor suppressor genes and tumors grow when normally cell growth would be controlled. DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements help retain genomic stability by keeping transcription from occurring in regions where it shouldn't and by preventing mutagenic events such as translocations, deletions, and insertions. Resulting genomic instability from hypomethylation of these areas of the genome can lead to cancers by causing undesirable gene expression or deletion of some genes.<br />In cancer poor promoters that are hypomethylated are able to cause gene activation or activate micro RNA that can repress tumor suppressor genes, resulting in tumor production. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation of the paternal allele in the imprint control region of Igf2 causes the paternal allele of the gene to be expressed by protecting the expression of the promoter for the gene and allowing it to act on the gene. The maternal gene is not expressed because the H19 region of the gene that is usually methylated in the paternal allele is active and blocks the promoter region of the gene from being expressed.  Monoallelic expression of the gene is caused by imprinting of the paternal allele, but is lost in cancer because the maternal allele is also methylated at the H19 area of the gene, so too much IgF2 is expressed causing too much growth potential in the cell, which leads to a type of cancer called Wilms tumour. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA-demethylating agents. It is used to treat myeloyiplastic syndrome that has  become acute lymphocytic leukemia. It acts by targeting DNMTi, an epigenetic enzyme, It is thought that it acts by affecting hypermethylation in these cancer cells, possibly by targeting hypermethylation of CPGis. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation that is caused by epigenetic drugs might cause changes in the DNA of cells other than tumour cells that could be inherited during sensitive periods in cell division when epigenetic marks are being reset, such as in hematopoetic cells, differentiating cells, germ cells, and in early fertilization of embryos. It would be inadvisable to use these drugs in, for instance, younger patients, where it might affect development of germ cells. </div>
