    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>The disruption of DNA methylation in some gene region  in normal cell can lead to cancer. In normal cell, the CpG islands are not being methylated, or
in other terms, it is hypomethylated. However, in cancer cell, the CpG islands
are more likely being hypermethylated, in other word, the DNA in the CpG islands
are methylated. Cpg islands are found in the promoter of tumor-suppressor
genes. Therefore, if the CpG islands are being methylated, then the
tumor-suppressor gene will be silenced or not expressed epigenetically. This
silencing can leads to cancer because the cell growth will not be suppressed. In
addition, this silencing event is very often found in tumor because of the DNA
methylation in the promoter of CpG Island is mitotically heritable, and also
the epimutation, which is reversible, can be rapidly selected.</p>

<p>Other components in the gene that can contribute to cancer
epigenetically are intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In the normal
cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are being methylated, or
in other words, hypermethylated. However, in cancer cell, it is commonly found
that these components are not being methylated, or in other words, being
hypomethylated. When these components are being hypomethylated, this can lead
to genomic instability because of many unnecessary additions or deletions of
gene in the genome, and also unnecessary reciprocal translocations. The genomic
instability can be occurred because of illegitimate recombination between
repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic
promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer. In the
paternal allele of normal cell, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated
and therefore the CTCF do not bind to ICR to insulate the ICR. This make the enhancer will act on the Igf2 and expressing the Igf2 gene. The H19 gene will not be expressed because it is methylated. On
the other hand, in the maternal allele, the enhancer cannot act
on Igf2 gene because the ICR is not methylated since the CTCF protect or insulate
the ICR from the methylation. Instead of expressing the Igf2 gene, the enhancer
only act on the H19 gene since this gene is unmethylated. With the loss of imprinting, in the case of Wilm’s
tumor, the maternal allele can also expressing the Igf2 gene, since the ICR is
methylated and therefore the enhancer will express the Igf2 gene and will not expressing H19 gene since this gene is methylated. As a
consequence, the result of the loss of imprinting is the doubling of the dose
of Igf2 protein. The Igf2 protein is responsible for cell growth, thus such doubling can lead to the overgrowth
of the cell and resulting in Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a type of drug that serves as a
DNA-demethylating agent or specifically DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).
DNA methylation is laid down by de novo methyltransferase. Decitabine is a
nucleoside analog, and it will inhibit DNA methylation by binding to the DNA-and-DNA
methyltransferase complex. After the methylated DNA copy the methylation to the
daughter strand, the DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly to the
decitabine and it can no longer be released.  This means that the action of decitabine is
division dependent so it need to have the cell replicating. This means that the
cancer cells which are dividing more rapidly than normal cell will be more
severely affected because they are replicating more than normal cell. Decitabine
could have an anti-tumor effect by inhibiting the hypermethylation in CpG
islands, which is one of the primary cause of cancer since the hypermethylation
can silence the tumor-suppresor gene expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, and therefore can
have lasting effects on the epigenome. Therefore, providing drugs that can
alter or cure disease epigenetically will provide a very good efficacy and
efficiency. The best time to treat the patients with such drugs is to avoid the sensitive period of
the patients. Sensitive period is the period when changes in the environment
that are going to have the biggest effect in live. Epigenetic reprogramming is essential
in sensitive period, which is consists of germ cell development and early embryonic
development. By treating patients during sensitive periods can lead to many
epigenetic abnormalities. For example in assisted reproductive technology
(ART), such abnormalities can occur such as Angelman syndrome and Beckwith
Wiedemann syndrome. In addition, based on Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents
and Children, which is studying about the environmental effect on the offspring
during sensitive periods, showed that high levels of anxiety in pregnancy are
linked in asthma babies.</p></div>
