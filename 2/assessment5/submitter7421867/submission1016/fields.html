    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is altered in cancer by hypermethylation of CpG islands and hypomethylation of DNA genome wide.  The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to allow for a control of proper gene expression.  Hypermethylation at CpG islands will lead to the silencing of tumor supressor genes, allowing for cancerous cells to avoid apoptosis. Normal DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements ensures silencing or for a low expression of these regions as opposed to the disrupted state in cancer, which leads to a hypomethylated state.  This hypomethylated state of intergenic regions and repetitive elements lends to genomic instability and cancerous possibilities.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele for Igf2 expression is activated by methylation of the ICR.  This methylation of the imprinted control region prevents a transcription factor from binding to the ICR and limits the H19 expressionf and allows the enhancers to activate and express the Igf2 in the paternal allele.  It is just the opposite in the maternal allele.  Igf2 is not expressed because it is in an unmethylated state and allows for a transcription factor to bind to the ICR... allowing for H19 expression and preventing enhancers downstream of activation Igf2.  In Wilm's tumor the normal maternal methylation pattern is disrupted from an unmethylated state to methylated state so now there is an over expression of Igf2. Igf2 is a growth factor gene so the loss of or disrupting of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to an activation of an oncogene and cancerous growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating  drug, therefore it inhibits DNA methylation.  Many cancers of the immune system are caused by an over expression of an enzyme known as EZH2 and this enzyme is responsible of attaching methyl groups to histones.  In a hypermethylation state caused by the over expression of EZH2 tumor supressor genes are methylated and thereby silenced.  If Decitabine is able to prevent the hypermethylation then it could have an anti-tumor effect by not allowing the tumor supressor genes from being silenced.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects o the epigenome because it can be passed on mitotically, meaning the altered DNA methylation is passed on to the daughter cells.  These daughter cells in turn carry on that altered DNA to their daughter cells and this how drugs that originally alter one gene's DNA methylation state can have that "enduring" effect on the epigenome.  There are definitely sensitive periods of development when one would avoid treating patients with such drugs, of course this would be when primordial germ cells are developing in humans and in patients that are very young. It would be inadvisable to treat patients with drugs that alter the DNA methylation state during these sensitive periods because of transgenerational effects it may have.  The altered DNA methylation may even have an impact on a developing child that is in the process of normal gene deactivation or gene activation as age progresses. </div>
