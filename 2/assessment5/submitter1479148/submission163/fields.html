    <div class="field-value"><strong>To the reader</strong>, <em>I've tried to make this as easy to read as possible!  If you struggled with any parts of my answers, I'd like to know what part of the answer was hard to understand and why.  (I'm a teacher and appreciate your constructive feedback very much).  Here's the answers:</em><br /><br />In cancer, DNA methylation is altered in two main ways.  DNA is both hyper- and hypomethylated.  The type of alteration is dependent on the region of DNA.<br /><br />DNA methylation normally functions as a silencing epigenetic mark.  In normal cells, CpG islands are mostly un-methylated.  When methylated, CpGs islands block the binding of transcription factors to neighbouring promotors.  Consequently, methylated CpG islands inhibit neighbouring gene expression.<br /><br />In cancer, CpG islands become hypermethylated.  Normally unmethylated CpG islands become methylated and the genes neighbouring the CpG islands are silenced.  Different CpG islands are hypermethylated in different tumours.<br /><br />Disruption of DNA methylation of CpG islands contributes to cancer because it silences tumour-supressor genes, blocking the production of proteins that would normally prevent uncontrolled cell growth.  <br /><br />In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated.  Methylation in both regions contributes to genomic stability. <br /><br />Changes to DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are opposite to the changes in CpG islands; these regions become hypomethylated in cancer cells. The normal methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is lost.   <br /><br />This loss of methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements causes genomic instability.  The genomic instability occurs for several reasons.  Unmethylated repetitive elements can transpose themselves, or can cause illegitimate recombinations.  Repetitive elements can be strong promotors and may cause constituent expression of growth genes.  Unmethylated intergenic regions can lead to cryptic transcription.  In cancerous cells, these changes increase growth-promoting gene expression and inhibit tumour-supressor gene expression.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of imprinting can promote cancer, as seen in disruption of the H19/Igf2 cluster: <br /><br />In normal cells, the maternal allele's imprint control region (ICR) is unmethylated.  This unmethylated ICR binds to CTCF, a transcription factor which acts as an 'insulator protein.'  CTCF blocks or 'insulates' the Igf2 gene from enhancers that instead cause the expression of the growth suppressor gene H19.  In contrast, the paternal allele's ICR is methylated.  CTCF cannot bind to the ICR, and consequently enhancers can access the Igf2 gene, allowing Igf2 transcription.  <br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele's ICR is hypermethylated.  The Igf2 gene is no longer 'insulated' from neighbouring enhancers and is expressed on both alleles.  Enhancers no longer activate H19 expression, as they are enhancing Igf2 instead. <br /><br />The Igf2 gene increases growth; increased expression of Igf2 encourages the growth of affected cells, and increased growth is a precursor to cancer.  While Igf2 expression is increased, the expression of H19 is decreased.   H19 is a regulator gene that inhibits growth.  With one epigenetic change, we see the increase in expression of a growth-promoting gene and the decrease in expression of a growth-inhibitor gene.  Both changes increase the likelihood of cancer.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Researchers are studying many drugs with potential for disrupting the epigenetic changes that encourage growth of cancer cells.  There are only 4 drugs approved by the FDA, one of which is Decitabine.  Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor.<br /><br />Decitabine causes a decrease in DNA methylation.  Decitabine does so by permanently deactivating DNMT1, which would normally maintain DNA methylation.  With Decitabine present, the DNMT1 in a dividing cell can no longer methylate newly formed DNA strands, and so DNA methylation is lost. <br /><br />In tumours where hypermethylation of CpG islands drives tumour growth, Decitabine causes global DNA demethylation, including demethylation of CpG islands.  This could have an anti-tumour effect by allowing tumour-suppressor genes to once again be expressed, though Decitabine may improve patient outlook by other mechanisms also. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation cause epigenetic changes.  Epigenetic changes persist once the molecules that cause them are gone, and are passed on to the daughter cells through mitosis.  These changes will persist if and until they are erased by the cell.  <br /><br />There are two main periods in an organism's life-cycle that are epigenetically sensitive; during the formation of primordial germ cells and during early embryo development.  During both these times, the genome's epigenetic marks are removed and reprogrammed.  These periods are 'sensitive periods' because they are most prone to epigenetic disruptions due to environmental influences.  <br /><br />The epigenetic drugs currently available for treating cancer patients either globally decrease a genome's DNA methylation or globally inhibit histone deacetylase.  These drugs pose little risk for the elderly, as the elderly are unlikely to experience long-term consequences.  However, some young patients are still creating primordial germ cells, and the disruptive influence of these drugs on the genomic marks in the germ-cell line is potentially very high.  We should avoid treating patients with epigenetic drugs during primordial germ cell production (preteens) and early development (early pregnancy).  </div>
