    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands are unmethylated and give rise to silencing of gene expression.</li><li>In cancer, the function of DNA methylation ta CpG islands are methylated  and give rise to activation of gene expression.</li><li>In cancer, the CpG islands are methylated and give rise to activation gene and the gene is mutated.</li><li>The normal function of  DNA methylation in both intergenic region and inrepetitive elements are methylated and the CpG islands are unmethylated.</li><li>In cancer, the DNA methylation the both intergenic region and in repetitive elements are unmethylated and the CpG islands are methylated.</li><li>Normally CpG islands are found in tumor supressor gene and with silencing of gene but in cancer cell it is methylated and activation of tumor supressor  gene contributes to cancer. <br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In paternal allele the H19 gene and imprint control region are unmethylated.This won't block the enhancers to act with lgf2 gene and this allow it to act directly with the lgf2 gene.</li><li>In maternal allele the H19 has long noncoding and the imprint control region is unmethylated and has CTCF protein on it.This CTCF protein will block the enhancers to act with lgf2 gene and so it will only act with H19.</li><li>In this case it loss imprinting and over expression of the promotors.This is because of loss of imprinted genes.</li><li>Due to the loss of cdkn 1c and upregulation of lgf2 gene cotributes to cancer</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine belongs to the combination of histone deacetylase and azacitidine.</li><li><br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>have shown that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and 
azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung 
cancer. This result was notable for two reasons. It was the first time 
epigenetic drugs had been deployed successfully against a solid tumour, 
rather than a leukaemia or a lymphoma (solid tumours are harder to 
treat, because the drug has to penetrate them). And, second, some of the
 participants in Dr Baylin's study who did not show much response to the
 trial itself then went on to show an unexpectedly good reaction to the 
routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them next. 
Although it is too early to say for sure, Dr Baylin speculates that his 
epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made 
them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</li><li>Sensitive periods are more likely to suspectible to environment and in diet that can change gene or mutations of gene.</li><li>Sensitive period developments are the pre-modigermcell development and age between 12 to 16.<br /></li></ul><br /></div>
