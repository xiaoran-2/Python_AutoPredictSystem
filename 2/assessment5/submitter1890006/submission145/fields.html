    <div class="field-value">Locus specific DNA hypermethylation and genomewide DNA  hypermethylation are the two  ways DNA methylation is altered in cancer. In normal cells there is hypo methylation at cpg islands and the genome itself is methylated in intervening regions and repetitive elements and introns in the gene. However in cancer cells cpg islands are likely to be methylated and rest of the genome is hypomethylated.There is a swap in terms of where DNA methylation is found.Cpg islands are normally found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. So when these cpg islands are methylated  in cancer cells they inactivate these tumour suppressor genes by silencing them and locks them in the inactive state.so cpg hypermethylation and silencing of tumour suppressor genes is found in tumours.this is more frequent than mutation in tumours as the cancer progresses we can observe increase in the methylation of cpg islands<br />DNA methylation in the rest of the genome contributes to genomic stability. When hypomethylation occurs at repetitive regions , cpg poor promoters and intergenic regions it causes genomic instability <br />Thereby causing cancer in the following ways.<br />1.illegitimate recombination between repeats<br />2. Activation of repeats and transposing<br />3.activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes.<br />This genomic instability causes cancer.<br />Hypo or hypermethylation of DNA at ICRs  can result in loss of expression of growth. Restricting genes or over expression of growth promoting genes and results in tumours.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Hypo or hypermethylation at imprint control regions can result in loss of expression of growth<br />Restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. That is they lose their imprinting and  they express from both parent alleles  or they are silent from both parent alleles. Lots of genes that are imprinted are involved in growth. We can have both hypo or hypermethylation of ICRs resulting in cancer. This depends on the function of the gene within the particular imprint control region.<br />In H19/Igf2  cluster ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. When it is unmethylated CTCF binds to  the ICR and hence enhancers act on H19 and Igf2 will be silenced in the maternal allele. However in the paternalallele ICR is methylated CTCF does not bind to it and the enhancers act on Igf2 activating it and expressing it. So in a normal cell Igf2 will only be expressed from the paternal allele. In Wilms tumour there is loss of imprint  and hypermethylation of ICR in the maternal allele as well. Igf2 is expressed from both alleles. Since Igf2 is a growth factor it's overexpression results in Wilms tumour, a cancer in children.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA demethylating agents. Hypermethylation of cpg islands and cpg island shores of tumour suppressor genes and loss of imprinting on ICRs by hypermethylation are some of the causes of  cancer. Decitabine being a demethylating agent will remove the methyl groups from the cancer cells thereby restoring the cell to normal cell. This will be able to treat cancer as upon removal of hypermethylation cells function normally without silencing tumour suppressor genes or over activating oncogenes. Hence there will not be uncontrolled cell division which is the cause of tumours. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation and histone deacetylase inhibition being  epigenetic changes is passed on to daughter cells during cell division until It is removed. Hence DNA demethylating agents while they remove the methyl groups also make sure the daughter cells are also unmethylated which is a lasting effect as the cells divide they create more unmethylated cells. However there is a sensitive period during which further treatment should wait because some time must be allowed for multiple cell divisions to occur so that we get a sizable amount of cells which are unmethylated/histone deacetylase inhibited and would react positively to chemotherapy. It is advisable to avoid treating patients during this sensitive period asnot enough unmethylated daughter cells would be present which can respond to further chemotherapy treatment positively.</div>
