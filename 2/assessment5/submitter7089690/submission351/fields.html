<div>DNA methylation can turn off some gene 
activity, re activation and expression of demethylation was induced gene. DNA 
methylation can cause chromatin structure, DNA conformation, stability of DNA 
and DNA protein interaction changes, so as to control gene expression. Research 
confirms, cytosine methylation of CpG dinucleotides resulted in a genetic 
disease in human 1/3 above the base transition caused 
by.Due to the close relationship between DNA 
methylation and human development and tumor diseases, especially the CpG island 
methylation induced transcriptional inactivation of tumor suppressor gene, DNA 
methylation has become an important research content view table genetics and 
epigenomics.The changes of methylation status is an 
important factor that causes tumors, such changes include reducing the whole 
genome methylation level and abnormal CpG island methylation of local level, 
leading to genomic instability (such as chromosomal instability, mobile express 
genetic factor activation, proto oncogene) do not express [4] and tumor 
suppressor genes. If the inhibition activity of cancer gene allele inactivation, 
increase the chance of cancer.The study of tumor methylation mainly 
concentrated in tumor suppressor gene. This is because people found cancer and 
tumor suppressor gene promoter CpG island methylation of tumor suppressor gene 
close the cause.Because the CpG island hypermethylation 
of the local malignant early in the cell, it can be used for early diagnosis of 
methylation in cancer prediction.But global hypomethylation with 
tumorigenesis and appear, and it increased with the malignant degree of the 
tumors and significant , so detecting methylation can be used for tumor 
grading. </div></div></div></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

<div> H19 showed biallelic expression by RNA nuclease protection analysis method, but still with maternal allele expression. The paternal allele H19 small and expression of human placental effective normal development. In situ hybridization with allele specific analysis indicated that the H19 in the trophectoderm derived cells showed biallelic expression, which originated from the inner cell mass of mesenchymal expression only maternal allele.In the receptor mediated, IGF2 through autocrine, paracrine and endocrine function. In addition, IGF2 also has IGF binding protein (IGF-BP) regulates physiological, there are 6 types of IGF-BP, combined with the inhibition of IGF2 receptor and prolong the half-life of IGF2. Expression of IGF2, IGF2R and IGF-BP genes are subject to long term and short term dual control. IGF2mRNA in the two cell stage embryos to the blastocyst stage, the expression reached the peak, and to detect IGF2 protein. Exogenous IGF2 can promote the early embryonic cells in mitosis. Results show that IGF2 in the very early stages of embryonic development (preimplantation) plays a very important role, and is mainly mediated by IGF1R. Because the IGF2R maternal allele loss can lead to early fetal death, so IGF2R in embryonic development and may also play a key role.</div></div></div></div></div>

    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value">The new HDAC inhibitors to further reveal the biochemical function of individual HDAC. In addition, the reason they are also more effective targeting specific epigenetic diseases, and to limit the overall HDAC inhibition.As a 2 '- deoxycytidine analogs. Decitabine has antitumor activity, and the performance for the dual mechanism of dose difference. Has cytotoxic effect at high concentration, low concentrations with demethylation. Effect on the proliferation stage (stage S) cells. As with 5- azacytidine, such demethylation drugs could inhibit DNA methyltransferase that tumor suppressor gene restored normal demethylation state in vivo, to re activate the DNA hypermethylation and inactivation of the gene, the cells recovered to normal terminal differentiation, senescence or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibitory activity of DNA methylation is 30 times of 5- azacytidine.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.

    <div class="field-value">Early detection of cancer is effective in the treatment of cancer patients is very important. At present, the diagnosis of cancer mainly depends on clinical symptoms, direct palpation, image signal detection (visualdetection) and tissue pathology, but there are many cancer clinical symptoms appeared later, and living body sampling detection difficult, serious impact on the early diagnosis and prognosis of cancer patients. However, with the occurrence and development of cancer in the abnormal DNA methylation phenomenon, and this phenomenon before diagnosis can be detected [16], DNA methylation levels suggest that some genes may be potential markers for early diagnosis of cancer, and even can be used as disease risk prediction, evaluation of clinical disease monitoring and effect evaluation.</div>
