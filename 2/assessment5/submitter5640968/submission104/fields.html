    <h1>Submission 104 from Anon (session_user_id: 823f8d8aeb09315cf3811c9a0159ff3f58c98a11)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects
that last beyond the period of drug treatment because DNA methylation is heritable —i.e. DNA methylation is passed on to
subsequent cells generations during cell division, and therefore maintained even when
drug administration has been removed.</p>

<p>On the
other hand, a sensitive period is a stage in development when epigenetic reprogramming
(clearance of epigenetic marks) occurs (repetitive elements and
imprinted genes undergo different epigenetic reprogramming). In mammalian
cells, epigenetic reprogramming takes place at two different stages: at early embryo
development (beginning immediately after fertilization and enduring until the morula
stage) and during primordial germ cell development —this period is even more
critical because imprinted genes are also reset. Childhood in females can also
be considered a vulnerable period, as the DNA of the oocytes do not undergo
methylation until females reach puberty.</p>

<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because
alterations in the normal process of epigenetic reprogramming can result in epigenetic
abnormalities, as it plays an important role in genomic imprinting, control of repetitive
elements, and epigenetic inheritance within generations.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands
are regions in the genome rich in unmethylated CpG dinucleotides that frequently
correspond to promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Due to methylation absence,
genes that regulate cell cycle, cell death programming or DNA repair, are active,
allowing cellular stability.</p>

<p>However, in
cancer cells, CpG islands are aberrantly hypermethylated. This hypermethylation
causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes by creating a repressive chromatin
structure that will alter gene expression. Tumor suppressor genes
deregulation will unleash cancer onset.</p>

<p>On the
other hand, in normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are
usually methylated, to maintain genomic integrity. Repeats are silenced to
prevent transposition and illegitimate recombination, and to avoid interference
from strong promoters. As methylcytosines may spontaneously mutate to thymine, methylation
of repeats will also prevent transposition .</p>

<p>Cancer
cells present genomic hypomethylation, which causes genomic instability and activation
of different oncogenes. Repetitive sequences, when unmethylated, can recombine
and give rise to karyotype abnormalities (deletions, insertions and
translocations). They also can activate neighbouring genes. Unmethylated transposable
elements are active, and therefore they can change their position within the
genome, causing gene disruptions. These elements also contribute to cancer onset.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19
and Igf2 are two imprinted genes belonging to the same cluster. Gene H19 is
maternally expressed whereas gene Igf2 is paternally expressed. </p>

<p>On
the paternal allele, methylated state of the imprinted control region (ICR) blocks
the binding of the zinc-finger CTCF protein. Without CTCF, H19 promoter is
methylated, and therefore, silenced. Downstream enhancers can access Igf2,
activating its expression. Igf2 is an
oncogene, because it promotes growth.</p>

<p>On the
maternal allele, unmethylated state of the ICR allows the binding of the CTCF
protein and its cofactors. CTCF acts like an insulator, preventing the union of
downstream enhancers to the Igf2 gene and causing the binding of the enhancers
to the H19 promoter, therefore allowing the expression of this gene. <br /></p>

<p>Wilm’s
tumor is characterized by an ICR hypermethylation that results in an overexpression
of oncogenes. In this situation, both alleles behave like the paternal allele,
which result in the loss of expression of H19 gene and the double expression of
the Ifg2 gene, with the subsequent increase in cell growth that might contribute to cancer.<br /></p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the group of DNMT
inhibitors. DNMT1 is an enzime that catalyses the transference of methyl groups
to cytosine nucleotides during cell division, maintaining the methylation
pattern of the cell. </p>

<p>Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that competes
with the cytosine nucleotide in the CpG islands. The presence of the drug inhibits
methylation of the CpG islands, because it forms a covalent bond with the
DNMT1, resulting in enzime degradation.</p>

<p>Whereas in normal tissues CpG islands are
free of methylation, in cancer cells CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated.
This hypermethylation results in silencing tumor suppressing genes —genes that
control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. </p>

<p>Therefore, decitabine has an anti-tumor
effect because is able to revert CpG islands to their original unmethylated state. However, we must keep I mind that due to its mechanism of action,
decitabine acts in an unspecific manner.<br /></p></div>
