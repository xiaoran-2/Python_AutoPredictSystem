    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation in vertebrates typically occurs at CpG sites. This methylation results in the conversion of the cytosine to 5-methylcytosine. Methylation of CpG sites within the promoters of genes can lead to their silencing, a feature found in a number of human cancers (for example the silencing of tumor suppressor genes). In contrast, the hypomethylation of CpG sites has been associated with the over-expression of oncogenes within cancer cells. Since age has a strong effect on DNA methylation levels of tens of thousands of CpG sites, one can define a highly accurate biological clock. In normal cells, CpG islands preceding gene promoters are generally unmethylated, while other individual CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome tend to be methylated. However, in cancer cells, CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters are often hypermethylated, while CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions and parasitic repeat sequences is often decreased. The entire genome of a cancerous cell contains significantly less methylcytosine than the genome of a healthy cell. In fact, cancer cell genomes have 20-50% less methylation at individual CpG dinucleotides across the genome.[5][6][7][8] In cancer cells “global hypomethylation” due to disruption in DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) may promote mitotic recombination and chromosome rearrangement, ultimately resulting in aneuploidy when the chromosomes fail to separate properly during mitosis. The CpG poor regions found in repetitive elements with in the intergenic and intronic regions of the genome are methylated and thereby maintain a closed chromatin structure. In cancer and on the inactive X chromosome many CpG islands become methylated, forcing these regions into a closed chromatin structure. DNA hypomethylation derives primarily from the repetitive fraction of the genome, occurs in premalignant lesions, and increases in magnitude during tumor progression. The loss of DNA methylation may promote tumorigenesis through the de-repression of endogenous transposons or miRNAs, DNA damage response.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele only and it is an embryonal growth factor.</div><div><div>H19 is expressed only from maternal allele and the function is currently not understood and although H19 RNA is abundantly transcribed in embryo it does not appear to be translated.<br /><div>In Wilm's tumour, the transcritionally silent maternal Igf2 allele is activated such that Igf2 expression occurs biallelically. A similar biallelic pattern of Igf2 expression is also seen normally in the choroid plexus and leptomeninges but both H19 alleles are silent. Conversely, In the methylase deficient case the disruption of dna methylation leads to the biallelic expression of H19 and an absence of Igf2 expression.</div></div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. <br />DNA-demethylating agents, in the form of decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. It functions in a similar manner to azacitidine (potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), known to induce demethylation and reactivation of silenced genes), although decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains.<br />Decitabine exhibits antitumoral properties in cells at clinically achievable doses and may be an effective adjuvant therapy in patients with advanced disease. Decitabine recovers expression of silenced genes, which suggests a possible role of epigenetic gene silencing in adrenocortical carcinogenesis.<br />It acts by removing inhibitory methyl groups from the cytosine residues of promoter sequences, which presumably restores downstream gene transcription. Gene silencing on chromosome may play a role in the rare malignancy’s origin.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A sensitive period is the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development.<div>A period of transitory and varying duration.</div><div>A time especially devoted to the acquisition of a particular trait.</div><div>There are successive stages the child passes through.</div><div>Each stage has its unique characteristics that require specific environment and kinds of teaching.</div><div>Each stage has one thing in common: each has its sensitive periods , or particular times when the child is attracted to certain activities in order for specific development to occur.</div><div>One can recognize a sensitive period occurring when you see child your child developing a passion for a certain toy or activity.</div><div>He may be trying to acquire balance and is drawn to walk on the cracks of sidewalks, or along the curb.</div><div>She may be drawn to pick up small objects of any kind to develop the pincer grip.</div><div>Your child will spontaneously repeat the activity again and again until one day the cycle is finished.</div><div>The activity may not seem to be particularly meaningful to you, but it fulfills some area of mental or physical development and aware parents and caregivers will permit the activity.<br />The child reacts to defend his internal growth and integrity.<br /></div></div>
