    <div class="field-value">The DNA methylation guarantees genomic stability and integrity. A
disruption of the specific methylation pattern in somatic cells (tissue- and
time-specific) leads to epigenetic disordering and cancer.

<p>Methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions is associated with
silencing of genes. In normal, healthy cells, CpG islands are usually
unmethylated, independent from the activation state of a certain gene. In
cancerous cells, CpG island methylation increases (hypermethylation) in a locus-specific
manner in promoters and on the shores of tumor suppressor genes and causes silencing
of these protective agents. During the development of the tumor, DNA
methylation seems to increase and accumulate at more and more disruptive sites
(promoters and promoter shores). This effect is used for evaluations of the
cancer, its prognosis and treatment options.</p>

<p><span>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated to
protect the genome from transposable elements and unwanted recombination
events. It also inhibits the binding of transcription factors at these sites. With that, DNA methylation assures chromatic stability.
A loss of methylation (i.e. hypomethylation) at intergenic regions and
repetitive elements leads to genomic, i.e. chromosomal, instability due to
illegitimate recombination between repeats, their activation and transposition. This enhances tumorigenesis. Reasons for the
disruption of DNA methylation can be stochastic events in replication (e.g.
random mistakes due to aging), altered composition of epigenetic complexes due
to stress events (e.g. because of environmental agents)</span></p>

<p>In cancerous cells, a changing DNA methylation pattern can be observed.
On the one hand, a global (genome-wide) hypomethylation takes place. On the
other hand, specific loci are hypermethylated. These changing marks can be used
as biomarkers for diagnostics and therapy. Although it is not quite clear
whether the epigenetic alterations are cause or consequence. Additionally, the
epigenetic marks of cancerous cells are tumour-specific and change over the
time (and in general with age).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting of genes is often associated with growth functions of
organisms in early development. One example is the Igf2/H19 complex. 

<p>In the paternal allele the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated
and spreads heterochromatically to the H19 promoter causing silencing of the
H19 gene. The CTCF insulator protein cannot bind to the ICR. The enhancers downstream
of H19 are not blocked by CTCF and the Igf2 gene is expressed paternally. </p>

<p>In the maternal allele no DNA methylation at the ICR and H19 promoter region
occurs. CTCF binds to the ICR insulating the enhancers from the Igf2 gene. The
Igf2 gene is not expressed maternally. The enhancers act only on the H19 gene.</p>

<p>A loss of imprinting occurs when the maternally inherited allele is
hypermethylated at the ICR, inhibiting the binding of CTCF and enabling the
enhancers to act on the Igf2 gene. As a result, the Igf2 gene is also expressed
maternally resulting in overexpression (double dose) and unwanted promotion of
growth. This can result in a childhood kidney tumour, called Wilm’s tumour.
This shows that the disruption of the methylation pattern at the H19/Igf2
cluster results in a loss of growth restriction genes (H19) and promotion of
overgrowth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, a DNMT inhibitor (DNMTi), which
bind as a synthetic nucleoside analogue to DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) and inhibits
the (re-)methylation of the DNA strand during replication. Without DNMT,
replicated, hemi-methylated DNA cannot maintain the original methylation
pattern and CpG islands cannot get methylated de novo. With this inhibition mechanism,
DNMTi act against wrongfully hypermethylated DNA, e.g. in cancer. In the course
of several cycles of DNA replication and cell division, the genome is
hypomethylated and certain genes, e.g. tumour suppressor genes, could potentially
get re-activated. As this effect is unspecific throughout the genome, i.e. it
works on all methylated sites in the same manner, it can have toxic effects to
the cells with increasing doses.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks like DNA methylation are mitotically heritable, that
means they last during the lifetime of an individual. Changing the DNA
methylation pattern in any direction (hypo- or hypermethylation; genome-wide or
at specific loci) can change the tissue-specific expression pattern of genes
and influence normal development and genomic stability. These epigenetic marks
are remarkably stable during cell division, but can be changed by environmental
agents especially – but not exclusively – during sensitive periods of
development like in early embryonic development and during primordial germ cell
genesis. These periods are sensitive for epigenetic reprogramming because of
the almost complete erasure and appropriate re-establishment of most epigenetic
marks on the genome. Environmental influences of any kind (nutrition, drugs, chemical
agents etc.) can disrupt this process and lead to disordered states. Treatment
of patients with epigenetically altering drugs during these periods (e.g.
during conception/ early pregnancy) can not only change the epigenetic marks of
the individual in his/her somatic cells (as the wanted outcome), but also have
a lasting effect on the offspring (and a following generation) and can inhibit
the correct forming of epigenetic marks to establish genomic stability,
imprinting etc.
