    <div class="field-value">In cancer cells, changes to DNA methylation involve both locus specific DNA hypermethylation and genome wide DNA hypomethylation. In normal cells, the CpG Islands are largely unmethylated, allowing  genes to be actively expressed when required. In cancer cells, the CpG Islands and surrounding 2kb shore areas become hypermethylated, resulting in loss of normal gene expression. This is especially important if the gene in question is a tumour suppressor gene, as loss of function can result in uncontrolled cell growth, a hallmark of a cancer cell. In addition, normal DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is also altered in cancer cells, resulting in genome wide hypomethylation. This can lead to increased genomic instability in the cancer cells, such as illegitimate recombination events,  as DNA methylation in these regions is required for chromosome organisation and genomic integrity. In addition, inappropriate gene activation in these regions can lead to transpositions, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes, all of which could promote the cancer cell phenotype.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption to imprinting, such as alteration to DNA methylation patterns at the Imprinted Control Regions (ICR) can contribute to the development of certain cancers. One such example involves hypermethylation the H19/IGF2 ICR. In normal cells, the maternal allele is unmethylated at the ICR, allowing the CTFC protein to bind and thus preventing downstream enhancers from accessing the IGF2 gene. This results in expression of H19 from the maternal DNA strand. Conversely, methylation of the ICR on the paternal allele blocks CTFC binding and allows DNA methylation to spread to the H19 promoter, thus silencing expression of the H19 gene. The downstream enhancers can now can now act on the IGF2 gene, resulting in expression of IGF2 from the paternal DNA strand. In Wilms Tumour, hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal strand leads to a 'paternal type' expression ie H19 silencing and expression of IG2F. As both the maternal and paternal strands now express IGF2, this overexpression promotes a tumour cell environment as IGF2 is a cell growth factor, resulting in increased cell proliferation and prevention of damaged cells from being destroyed.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs known as DNA methylating agents. Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent which switches off a protein called DNA methyltransferase. It does this because it is nucleoside analogue of cytidine and, as such, it is incorporated into nascent DNA strands during DNA replication.  DNA methyltransferases recognise and bind to the nucleoside analogue but are unable to function properly, thus preventing methylation marks being incorporated into the DNA, leading to hypomethylation. This should then limit the harmful effects associated with hypermethylation of cancer cells, such as inactivation of tumour suppressor genes, thereby restoring the tumour cells to a more 'normal' phenotype. In addition, at higher doses, Decitabine can have a non-specific toxic effect which should preferentially affect cancer cells due to the fact that cancer cells divide more rapidly and would incorporate the analogue more quickly than the slower proliferating normal cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation primarily occurs at cytosine residues on DNA and these epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. This means that any drug which alters DNA methylation without killing the cells allows the pattern of methylation to be passed on to daughter cells even when the drug is no longer being administered. This could produce long term effects which could have consequences for the remainder of the patients life.. Whilst the administration of such a drug would be beneficial to older adults suffering from certain diseases, such as cancers, it would be wise to avoid giving such drugs during 'sensitive periods' as these are critical periods when there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanism. There are two crucial periods where this occurs - during gametogenesis and during early development, so the use of such drugs on young children, pre-adolescents and pregnant women should be treated with extreme caution, to prevent unwanted side effects in future generations.</div>
