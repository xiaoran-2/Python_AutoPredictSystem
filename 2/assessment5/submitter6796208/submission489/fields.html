    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, DNA methylation occurs almost only at CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promotores. Paradoxically CGis are protected from methylation. DNA methylation is an inactive epigenetic mark, that is methylation at CpG islands is correlated with the silencing of gene expression using two mechanism: the primary one refers to formation of repressive chromatin structure that doesn't allow transcription; the secondary mechanism is related to the ability of CGIs of disallowing transcription factors binding therefore altering gene expression. <br />It has been observes in cancers such as retinoblastoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer etc. that CpG islands suffer hypermethylation at specific gene sites: rb for retinoblastoma, MLH1 for CRC, BRCA1 for breast cancer resulting in gene silencing.<br />Rb, MLH1, BRCA1 are known to be Tumor Suppressor Genes-TSG- that in normal circumstances, once expressed fight against cells featuring malignant characteristics. Hence, once altered, DNA methylation at CGIs prohibit specific TSGs to be read, therefore silencing the specific genes.<br />DNA methylation occurs at three particular places: CpG islands-previously discussed- Intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br />DNA methylation at intergenic region has a still debatable function: it is thought to maintain genomic integrity.<br />DNA methylation at repetitive has a well known role in genome's economy: it preserves genomic integrity by silencing or mutating the repeats- in both cases to prevent transposition. Also methylation of repeats may avoid unnatural recombinations; strong promoters can mingle in transcription so silencing of repeats help avoid this aberrant situation.<br />A second error found in cancer is a global DNA hypomethylation. It has been described a possible mechanism of demethylation: oxidation of 5mC by TET proteins to 5hmC or deamination of 5mC thymine by AID/APOBEC1.<br />High levels of 5mhC are correlated with active or passive demethylation  during replication leading to loss of genomic stability and integrity. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 resides on the paternal allele, where the ICR is usually methylated-therefore being paternally imprinted- so the CTCF-insulating protein-can't bind and the downstream enhancers can promote Igf2's expression.<br />H19 is found on the maternal allele, where the ICR is normally unmethylated and protected by CTCF. This means that the Igf2 is shielded by downstream enhancers which can pursue H19.<br />Aberrations at the H19/Igf2 cluster (e.g. upregulation of Igf2) lead to an imprinted disorder called the Beckwith-Widemann Syndrome, characterized by predisposition to childhood tumors such as Wilm's tumor(also macroglosia and pre- and post-natal overgrowth).Imprinting is disrupted in several ocasions: mutations or deletions, existence of two copies of one parental chromosome, the paternal chromosome in this case and epigenetic ruptures.<br />It is well known that Igf2 is an oncogene. Loss of imprinting can lead to hypermethylation of ICRs or hypomethylation of ICRs having as consequence over-expression of the growth promoting gene, Igf2 in this case. This phenomenon appears to be an primal event in tumorigenesis. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor.<br />DNMT1 recognizes hemi-methylated DNAs and it lays down a methyl group on the daughter strand which is not methylated. DNMT3a and DNMT3b work on unmethylated DNAs; these <i>de novo </i>methyltransferases establish methylation patterns in early embryonic development. Hence Decitabine, a nucleoside analogue, irrevocably binds DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, causing the decay of the cell's DNA and it's death.<br />Decitabine causes DNA demethylation consequently being useful in cases of tumor suppressor hypermethylation.It is outmost important to use low doses of DNMT inhibitors because only these have indeed anti-neoplastic impact. The drug is utilized in haematological cancers such as myelodisplastic syndromes wich later in development will cause <span>acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">It has been established that DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that is DNA methylation is mitotically heritable which means that any hit on DNA methylation can have long term effects on the epigenome.<br />A sensitive period is defined as a period of time in mammalian development or gametogenesis when the newly formed organism is predisposed to aberrations due to injuries at molecular level. <br />There are two sensitive periods, well described and well characterized : primordial germ cell development  and early embryonic development.<br />Primordial germ cells will become oocytes or spermatozoa in later life, so any injury at this level, induced by chemotherapeutic drugs, have a potential teratogenic effect; same happens if a pregnant woman undergoes chemotherapy: the epigenetic marks that need to be cleared between generations to restore pluripotency  will be wrongfully set and the the child will have birth defects or will die <i>in utero.</i> <br />External source: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/11304375@N07/7178272407/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/11304375@N07/7178272407/</a><br />                          <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">http://www.economist.com/node/21552168</a><br />                          <a href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture">https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture</a><br />                          <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/" title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/</a></div>
