    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:

function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Describe the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br /></li></ul>DNA methylation is about adding a methyl group to the cytosine or adenine nucleotides. It can result in transcriptional silencing at CpG islands by blocking the binding of transcription factors or recruting MBD proteins.<br /><ul><li>Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.</li></ul>DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands is usually found in cancer. In other words, enriched DNA methylation is found.<br /><ul><li>Explain how disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br /></li></ul> The DNA hypermethylation may silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer. <br /><ul><li>Describe the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</li></ul>DNA methylation in Intergenic regions and repetitive elements can result in genomic stability.<br /><ul><li>Describe how DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.</li></ul>DNA hypoimethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is usually found in cancer. In other words, depleted DNA methylation is found.<br /><ul><li>Explain how disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to cancer.</li></ul>DNA hypoimethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements cam result in genomic instability e.g. illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes.<span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status.  <br /></li></ul>The paternal allele is usually methylated. Thus the neighboring enhancers help enhance/activate igf2 expression.<br /><ul><li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status.  <br /></li></ul>The maternal allele is usually NOT methylated. Thus the neighboring enhancers are blocked by CTCF. They cannot help enhance/activate igf2 expression. Thus igf2 expression is inhibited.<br /><ul><li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.  <br /></li></ul>The maternal allele is methylated in Wilm's tumour.<br /><ul><li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer. </li></ul>The maternal methylation results in Igf2 overexpression n Wilm's tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;

It is a DNA-methylation inhibitor.</span><br /><ul><li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation. <br /></li></ul>It removes the DNA methylations caused by cancer.<br /><ul><li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.  </li></ul>It can demethylate DNA methylations on CpG island, turning on the tumor-suppressor genes back.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. <br /></li></ul>Altering DNA methylation can open up chromains, enabling the epigenome to be targeted by standard chemotherapy.<br /><ul><li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period. </li></ul>A sensitive period is a period in which a patient's epigenome is very easy to modified by external factors such as environment radiation, chemical agents, and drugs.<br /><ul><li>Identify sensitive periods of development. </li></ul>Germ cell development. Embryo early development.<br /><ul><li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable. </li></ul>Treating patients during sensitive periods can affect their germ cell development, which may have adverse effects on their offspring.<br /></div>
