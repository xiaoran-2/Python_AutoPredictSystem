    <div class="field-value">The action of tumour suppressor genes prevents cell division and allows apoptosis so, it prevents the cell from becoming a cancer cell. In the promoters of those tumor supression genes there are regions called CpG islands that, in a normal cell, are not methylated in general, so the gens are active. In contrast, in a cancer cell, we frequently found those CpG islands more methylated than in a normal cell (hypermethylated) and that means that the tumour supressor gens are inactive. The inactivation of the tumour suppressor genes by hypermethylation of the CpG islands is mitotically heritable so, the progenie of a cancer cell will have a competitive advantage over the normal cells (because they can divide more rapidly and avoid death), leading to the formation of a tumour.<br /><br />In another hand, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated in a normal cell and hypomethylated in a cancer cell. If the hypomethylation is found in the CpG poor promoters (that, in contrast with the CpG islands, are methylated in normal cells) it results in the activation of the asociated genes, that are silent in normal cells. If those gens are oncogenes, whose action is the opposite than tumour suppressor genes, it can produce cancer.<br />If the hypomethylation is found in the repetitive elements, it can produce illegitimate recombination between them, because they are less densely packaged than in a normal cell, and it can lead to reciprocal translocation between different chromosomes. It can also activate the repeats and allow their transposition to another place of the genome, that can cause gene disruption or activation of cryptic promoters, having aberrant transcription of the surrounding genes. The consecuence of that hypomethylation is genomic instability, that is associated with cancer.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>The H19/Igf2 cluster </span>is paternally imprinted. The imprinted control region of the paternal allele is methylated, and the downstream enhancers activate the transcription of the long noncoding RNA Igf2. In contrast, in the maternal allele, it is unmethylated and is bound by a protein that insulates Igf2 from the enhancers, that are then free to act on H19, allowing its expression. So, Igf2 is expressed in the paternal allele but not in the maternal one.<br />When the imprinting is lost for some reason, both copies of the gene behave like the paternal or the maternal ones. If the maternal allele behaves like the paternal one, there is an overexpression of Igf2, that is associated with the Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome. Patients with that syndrome are predisposed to embryonic or chilhood tumours, like Wilm's tumour, because Igf2 is an oncogene.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent so, it removes DNA methylation from the genome. When that drug is used in a tumour, the result is the removal of the epigenetic marks in the genome of the cancer cells and their progenie, slowing down the growth of the tumour and making it more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A sensitive period is a period of time when epigenetic reprogramming (reestablishment of DNA methylation marks) occurs. Early embrionic developement and gametogenesis are sensitive periods. If a patient is in a sensitive period (childhood, adolescence or pregnancy), the treatment can affect their progenie because, the drug can alterate the methylation pattern of the embrio or the germ cells and, as the changes in DNA methylation are irreversible and heritable, the effects on the epigenome can be life-long.</div>
