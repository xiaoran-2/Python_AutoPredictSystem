    <div class="field-value"><div><div>DNA methylation is one of the best-known epigenetic mark. When occurring in gene promoters, it tends to be associated with the relevant gene being silenced. An exception to that rule is specific CpG-rich regions of gene promoters known as “CpG Islands”, which tend to be unmethylated no matter what the expression state of the gene is. In cancer cells, while one finds reduced methylation throughout the genome, it is remarkable that CpG islands in gene promoters tend to be more methylated than in normal cells, causing the relevant gene to be very stably silenced. This happens specifically in the promoters of tumour suppression genes, therefore reducing or silencing their activity.</div><div>Outside of gene promoters and in intergenic regions, normal cells tend to exhibit high methylation in repetitive elements, for instance transposons. This high methylation is associated with repressed transcription of these elements, and generally with higher genomic stability. Cancer cells, as explained earlier, exhibit general hypomethylation throughout the genome, including these normally highly-methylated regions. Lower methylation of CpG dinucleotides in repetitive elements contribute is associated with their being euchromatinized, and therefore more available as recombination or translocation sites. As a consequence, genomic and chromosomal instability is increased, which is a hallmark of cancer cells.</div></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In order to discuss the relation between loss of imprinting and cancer, let us consider the H19/Igf2 cluster on chromosome 11. This cluster contains an imprint control region (ICR) which is normally methylated on the paternal allele but crucially not on the maternal allele. This ICR notably controls the activity of the insulin-like growth factor Igf2 by blocking the action of DNA regions downstream of the cluster, which act as enhancers. When the ICR is methylated, like on the paternal allele, the enhancers promote the expression of Igf2 (via chromatin looping). When the ICR in unmethylated like on the maternal allele, a protein known as CTCF is free to bind to the ICR. This physically blocks access of the enhancers to the Igf2 gene, which is then downregulated.</div><div>In a Wilm's tumour cell, the maternal allele is methylated, like the paternal allele in a normal cell. This means that CTCF cannot bind and block the enhancers. As a result, Igf2 is expressed on both the paternal and maternal allele. As a result of this disruption of imprinting, the cell produces twice as much Igf2 as normal, which increases growth and cellular division, that is to say, cancer.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine (marketed as Dacogen) is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor used to treat severe cases of myelodysplastic syndrome. It acts by binding irreversibly with DNA methyltransferases, therefore disrupting the mechanism of DNA methylation heritability through mitosis: daughter cells will not exhibit the patterns of DNA methylation of their parent cells. Over time and after many mitoses, this results in a dilution effect to methylation: rapidly-replicating cells such as cancer cells become hypomethylated.</div><div>A number of cancer types, such as myelodysplastic syndrome, seem to be dependent on CpG island hypermethylation in the promoters of tumour-suppressing genes, thereby silencing these genes. For that reason, inhibiting methylation can be an efficient way to slow or halt tumour growth.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is a stable, mitotically herited mark. This means that, outside of active reprogramming events, the specific patterns of DNA methylation exhibited by a cell are herited by all its descendants. This explains why the action of drugs that target DNA methylation lasts durably, long after the treatment is ended.</div><div>For that reason, we do not want to use these drugs thoughtlessly. Two periods of time are particularly sensitive: these are when the active reprogramming events we alluded to occur. At these times, DNA methylation is selectively cleared and reset. These events occur at two specific times in life: immediately after fertilization, and later on during primordial germ cell development, when the progenitor cells of sperm and eggs start to differentiate.</div><div>Any disruption to the epigenome that happens at these times could have grave consequences (disruption of imprinting, loss of repetitive element silencing, etc.) for the whole lifetime of the organism. Furthermore, if germ cells cannot be reprogrammed correctly, abnormal gametes can be produced leading to fertility issues or indeed severe health issues in subsequent generations.</div></div>
