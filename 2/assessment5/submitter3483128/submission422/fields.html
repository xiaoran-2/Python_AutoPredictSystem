    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are not methylated in normal tissues, but as the stages of tumorigenesis progress, the level of methylation increases. This might be related to the inactivation of tumour suppressor genes, one of the multiple hits that are needed for a cancer to progress. Hypermethylation of CpG islands is one of the epigenetic marks of cancer, and can be used as a biomarker to detect not only the existence of a tumour, but even the tumour type, as well as the prognosis and possible response to treatment. Examples of hypermethylation are retinoblastoma, colorectal cancer or breast cancer.
Unlike CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal tissues. Methylation of repeats is linked to genomic stability, since these repeats can lead to illegitimate recombination, transposition or activation of criptic promoters, and need to be silenced in normal cells. In cancer cells, repeats are hypomethylated, and this disruption of the normal pattern allows all this genomic abnormalities -insertions, deletions, translocations- to occur. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can activate the associated oncogene and trigger cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is one of the four drugs that have been approved by the FDA to be used as chemotherapeutics targeted to the epigenetic machinery of cancer. This drug is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into DNA during replication and inhibits the activity of the DNA methyl transferases, DNMT, by irreversibly binding to them. Therefore, its global effect is DNA demethylation. As cancer cells are constantly replicating, they are more susceptible to these drugs than normal cells. Decitabine is used against myelodysplastic syndromes. It has been shown that low doses of this type of drugs have an antineoplasic effect, although the exact mechanism of action is still unclear.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic marks are mitotically inherited, that is, they are passed on to the daughter cells with every cell division, 
Sensitive periods are certain periods of time in a person's life when epigenetic marks are being laid down, especially the pre-implantation period of the embryo, and the formation of the primordial germ cells that will produce the gametes. Altering the normal activity of the epigenetic machinery by treating young patients or pregnant women with these drugs could have unpredictable and probably damaging consequences in the next generations, and this is the reason why these treatments would be unadvisable in these cases.</div>
