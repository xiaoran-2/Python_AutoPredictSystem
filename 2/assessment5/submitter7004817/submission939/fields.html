    <div class="field-value"><p><span><strong>DNA methylation</strong>(a heritable epigenetic mark) involves the covalent transfer of a methyl group to the C-5 position of the
cytosine ring of DNA by DNA methyltransferases.</span> <strong>CpG islands</strong> (CpGIs) are short interspersed DNA sequences that are different from the average genomic pattern by being GC-rich and maintained in a predominantly <em>nonmethylated </em>state and are sites for transcription initiation. Shared DNA sequence features, along with hypomethylation, adapt CpGIs for promoter function by destabilizing nucleosomes and attracting proteins that create a transcriptionally permissive(open) chromatin state (<i>Deaton.A &amp; Bird A. Genes and Development 2011. 25:1011)</i>. Some CGIs do become methylated in normal development - as with <i>one female X chromosome</i> becoming  'inactivated', whilst the CpGIs on<em> the other (functioning) X chromosome </em>remains nonmethylated and 'active' (see course notes).</p><p>It is proposed that CpGIs are subject to <strong>sporadic de novo methylation </strong>which is then actively removed by a DNA demethylase. Defects in such a system may predispose to <em>residual (de novo) methylation</em> as seem in many cancers and related to extrinsic (environmental) factors. So, a previously hypomethylated promotor (CpGI) region becomes methylated, playing an important role in oncogenesis due to its influence on local chromatin structure/ gene activity regulation, resulting in <strong>transcriptional silencing</strong> of important <b>Tumour suppressor genes </b>which<b> </b>control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair .</p><strong>Intergenic regions with repetitive elements </strong>(approx 45%) of the mammalian genome consists of transposable and viral elements that are<b> silenced by bulk methylation </b>and so allow stability of the genome. In cancer, instead there is <b>global hypomethylation</b> and reduced supression of repetitive element transcription and transposition, leading to <b>genomic instability </b>and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes resulting in<b> oncogene activation.</b>  (Wu H, et al . 2011. Genes Dev25: 679–684). Proto-oncogenes are a group of genes that cause normal cells to become cancerous when they are mutated into ongogenes.<p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>Imprint control region (ICR) methylation </b>is established in primordial germ cells to achieve parent­ of ­origin specific epigenomic marks, maintained in the embryo. This ICR methylation is <em>actively protected (genetic imprinting) during reprogramming</em> in the <strong>early </strong><div><strong>embryonic period, </strong>right after the egg is fertilized, when the <i>paternal genome and </i> <i>maternal genome</i> are heavily demethylated, This occurs because the DNA has particular methylation patterns to be re-established for proper cell functioning of the sperm and the egg.  When <b>new germ cells</b> are formed in the embryo, these ICR regions are erased and re­methylated according to the gender. Both these times are '<b>SENSITIVE PERIODS' </b>of development. Drugs used at this time (<strong>pregnant woman- very early first trimester</strong>) can dysregulate methylation and affect gene imprinting in the primordial germ cells- leading to effects that last well beyond the period of drug administration so drug administration then is inadvisable and can lead to enduring effects in the offspring (and their future offspring- notably female).<br />Importantly, DNA methylation is essential for normal development- involved in key processes including: genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and suppression of repetitive element transcription and transposition. With specific genes remaining epigenetically silenced through gametogenetic reprogamming, genomic integrity is maintained. (ref:Dr.Baylin 'Economist').<br /><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><div>A small proportion (&lt;1%) of genes in mammals are <b>imprinted</b>-  gene expression occurs <i>from only one allele</i>.The <b>expressed allele</b> is dependent upon its parental origin e.g: gene encoding <b>Igf2</b> is only expressed from the non-imprinted paternal allele<i> - therefore d (remains nonmethylated) in the father</i>, while <b>H19 </b>is expressed from the non-imprinted (nonmethylated) <i>maternal allele. </i>The <b>imprinted alleles </b>are <i>silenced by methylation. </i>Therefore unlike the paternal Igf2 allele, <b>in the mother this Igf2 allele is silenced</b> (hypermethylation) and imprinted (non-imprinted H19  allele is nonmethylated and active). So, genomic imprinting involvies DNA methylation to achieve monoallelic gene expression (silencing of imprinted gene).<br /><br />In <b>Wilms tumours</b> maternal IGF2 imprint is 'relaxed'-the gene is expressed biallelically with expression of this maternal IGF2 associated with no <i> H19 expression</i>. Acquisition of this paternal 'epigenotype' contributes to cancer. <b>(Proc.Natl. Acad.Sci, Vol 192. USA  2005)</b>The 'relaxation' involves alteration in expression of imprinted genes controlled by <b>Imprint Control Regions (ICR) </b>involving <i>reversing methylation </i>of<b>  maternally inherited IGF2 </b>(unsilencing<b>) </b>and allows methylatiing of <b>H19 allele</b> (silencing). At the<i> H19/Igf2 cluster</i> <b>methylation prevents enhancer blocking</b> by stopping CTCF binding to the ICR, Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence AND <b>enhancers can now access Igf2 </b>to '<i>activate'.</i>(course notes).</div><div>.<br /><br /></div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /><div><br /></div></div><div><div><br /></div></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine treats certain cancers and belongs to the <b>DNA-demethylating class of epigenetic inhibitors. </b> It is produced by the Japanese company Eisai and is sold under the name of "Dacogen". By <b>inhibiting DNA methylation</b>, Decitabine importantly impacts the DNA methylation <i>regulation</i> involved in disease led silencing of important genes<b>, </b>allowing instead their activation and expression. No longer silenced, important <b>tumour suppressor genes</b> can then contribute to anti-tumour activity to help 'fight' the cancer. The development of cancer is known to be associated with promotor region hypermethylation and gene silencing, in addition to adverse 'global' genonome hypomethylation.</p>

<p><span>Decitabine by causing DNA-demethylation acts as an epigenetic inhibitor of <b>‘gene silencing’ </b> – removing methyl groups from the DNA  allow previously silenced (e.g: by tumour induced 'promotor region' hypermethylation) genes to now be expressed. Decitabine results in the “unsilencing” of <b>Tumour suppressor genes </b>and expression of their anti-tumour effect e.g to reduce tumour proliferation.(Economist article</span>).</p></div>
