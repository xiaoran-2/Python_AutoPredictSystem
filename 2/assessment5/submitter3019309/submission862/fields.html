    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are generally protected from methylation, and so normally not very methylated, but in the case of cancer cells, the CpG islands have been found to be methylated to a greater degree. This hypermethylation will sometimes also spill over on the 'shores' of an island (a couple kb at either end), and in this way silence or inhibit an underlying gene through methylation of its promoter region. Often, this underlying gene will be a growth suppressor which, in turn, otherwise might have acted to inhibit tumor growth. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements, on the other hand, will often be highly methylated in normally functioning cells. In cancer cells though, they are affected by a genome wide tendency towards hypomethylation, and thereby allowed to contribute to genomic instability. Repeats can be especially dangerous, since they are easily misread or transported/transplanted into other parts of the genome, and sometimes even to a completely different chromosome. Intergenic regions also harbour plenty of transgenes, which can be harmful unless silenced by methylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal, healthy cell, the functioning of the H19/Igf2 cluster differs between the paternal and maternal alleles. In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and thus silenced, allowing Igf2 to be enhanced and expressed. In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated and can bind to CTCF, which will allow enhancers to act on H19 instead, while Igf2. In Wilm's tumour, this imprinting is disturbed, so that H19 will be methylated and inhibited in both alleles, and the growth promoting Igf is allowed to be expressed at roughly the doubled dose compared to normal.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is one of the DNMT inhibiting drugs now available, and since it targets methyl transferases, it will generally lower the availability of methyl donors in the cells. As DNMTs are heavily involved in methylation during cell division, the effect of inhibiton will be greatest where the cells are dividing the most frequently and intensely, e g in an aggressive tumour growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks in general, and especially DNA methylation, largely have the property of being mitotically inheritable. Thus, once a change has been made to any of these epigenetic marks, it will tend to be maintained and spread locally in the tissue, through and enduring mitosis. For drug induced changes to DNA methylation, this has also been shown to actually happen both in vitro and in vivo. Drugs targeting different parts of the epigenetic machinery, e g methylation and acetylation respectively, have also been found capable of interacting favorably. In the case of prepubescent men and women, and, in fertile women trying to conceive, from around the time of conception and through pregnancy, caution must be taken for drugs not to interfere with the sensitive periods of clearing and resetting of the epigenetic marks. One of these sensitive periods is the early stages of embryonic growth, when the cells first appear as pluripotent and then gradually regain epigenetic marks and thus differentiate; the other is the creation and development of new germ cells, where especially the egg cells take their due time to mature, and are vulnerable in the process.</div>
