    <div class="field-value">     CpG islands are predominantly located at promoters of genes. For the most part of genome CpG islands tend to be unmethylated. In case CpG islands are methylated this results with silencing of gene expression, for example imprinted genes are inherited with a specific epigenetic state that determines silencing of that gene.<br />      In  cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to be methylated and the target of methylation are promoters of tumour suppressor genes. In consequence many genes that respond for regulating activity of cell: growth, metabolic pathways and others, are not expressed, creating imbalance and causing transformation in a cancer cell.  <br />     DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements maintain genomic stability, silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. In contrast in cancer cells these regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, and this leads to disruption of genomic stability, so repetitive elements can now be transcribed and inserted everywhere in the genome.<br />     Abnormalities in structure of chromosomes and genes, due to genomic instability, results in disturbances in cell activity, for example sustaining proliferative signaling, etc., and that’s make a normal cell to become a cancer cell.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">     A common feature in cancer cells is loos of imprinting. Thus imprinted genes can be either hypermethylated or hypomethylated,  depending on the particular ICR and the gene function. So they can be  either expressed or silenced from both parental allele. <br />     H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of hypermethylation of imprinted genes.<br />     ICR from the paternal allele is methylated and it’s unmethylated on the maternal allele. When ICR is unmethylated a insulator protein called CTCF can bind to imprinted control region. This means that the enhancers can act on H19 (encodes long noncoding ARN) and consequencely Igf2 will be silenced on the maternal allele. So the gene Igf2 will not be expressed on the maternal allele.<br />     When imprinted control region  is methylated, and methylation spreads aout to H19, and also CTCF can not binding to ICR. In this case enhancers act on Igf2 resulting in expression of this gene on the paternal allele.<br />     In cancer cells both ICRs from both parental alleles are methylated, so Igf2 from maternal allele is also expressed. Finally there are a double dose of Igf2 (growth promoting gene) expression leading to cell overgrowth that is an abnormality of cancer cells and this is associated with Wilm’s tumour. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">     Decitabine is a drug that acts on enzymatic epigenetic regulators. It is a chemical molecule that inhibits DNA methylation, in other words it inhibits DNA methyltransferase. <br />     This drug is nucleotide analog, so it can insert into DNA.  During DNA replication Decitabine get incorporated into DNA. When daughter strand is complete, then DNA methyltransferase comes to copy the methylation to this new strand. And by binding to Decitabine, DNMTi can no longer be released, so it is bound irreversible.<br />     A very important feature of this chemical molecule is cell division dependency. This determines a more severe effect on cancer cells because they are replicating more and much more rapidly than normal cells.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">     Drug molecules that altered DNA methylation remain incorporated into DNA. Treatment with epigenetic drugs for long periods of time results with  accumulation of a high dose of this chemical. A high dose of drug can cause genetic mutations that is another premise for developing cancer.<br />     There are two sensitive periods: primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation period, when epigenetic state is erased and reprogramed.  So in these particular periods epigenetic state can be easily influenced by environment.  In consequence the epigenome can goes wrong if the organism is exposed to chemicals or other factors.  So for young people there is a very high risk in epigenetic drug administration, particularly those who have developing germ cells. <br />     Administration of drugs in developing germ cells can affect the next generation, it can inhibit epigenome regulators (different enzyme types). This means that there will be disruptions of the epigenome marks that can cause a lot of disease due to loss of imprinting. <br /><br /><br /></div>
