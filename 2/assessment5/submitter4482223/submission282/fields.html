    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are protected from methylation in normal cells, so they are usually not methylated. In cancer cells, however, CpG islands demonstrate hypermethylation, so there is an increased amount of CpG island methylation. Methylation of CpG Islands in cancer cases causes the silencing of tumor suppressor genes that could otherwise prevent the cancer from developing. <br /><br />In normal (i.e. noncancerous) cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated to silence these regions and therefor help maintain genomic integrity. In cancer cells, there is a tendency toward hypomethylation genome-wide, so these regions are more frequently unmethylated, and this leads to a loss of genomic stability. In these types of regions, the DNA methylation helps to silence cryptic transcription start sites or splice sites, and it also helps to prevent mutation and transportation of the repetitive elements, both of which can lead to detrimental recombination.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele for H19/Igf2, the imprint control region is methylated, which block the binding of CTCF (an insulator protein that blocks downstream enhancers that would activate Igf2.) So, essentially, on the paternal allele in a normal, non cancerous cell, the imprint control region is methylated, CTCF cannot bind to the ICR, and the downstream enhancers activate production of Igf2. <br /><br />In a normal cell, the maternal allele's ICR is NOT methylated, CTCF binds, and this prevents the action of the enhancers, so Igf2 remains inactive. This allows H19 to be expressed (H19 is not expressed on the paternal allele.)<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, there is hypermethylation seen at the H19/Igf2 ICR, so both the maternal and paternal alleles are methylated, which prevents CTCF from binding to either ICR, with the result that both the maternal and paternal alleles will express Igf2, and neither one will express H19.<br /><br />Igf2 is a growth promoting oncogene, so the doubled expression of the gene will contribute to the unrestricted growth that is seen in cancer cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, also known as Dacogen, is a DNMTi, or DNMT inhibitor. Decitabine blocks the action of DNA methyltransferase, and therefor inhibits DNA methylation. In cancer, hypermethylation can contribute to unrestricted cell growth by silencing tumor suppressor genes, or as in the case above, can cause a loss of imprinting and therefor upregulation of growth promoting genes such as Igf2. By reducing the amount of DNA methylation, Decitabine might prevent methylation at tumor suppressor genes or imprint control regions from being maintained, which could lead to those genes being expressed as they would be in a normal cell. In either case, whether by allowing expression of a tumor suppressor gene, or by preventing over expression of a growth promoting gene, the results would be to limit the uncontrolled growth of the cancer tumor cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark, so once it is laid down (or subsequently removed), the methylated or unmethylated state is maintained when the cell reproduces. The exception to this is during sensitive periods, when epigenetic marks are being cleared and then reset in order to prepare for the creation of gametes, or to establish genetic marks in a developing embryo. These sensitive periods, therefore, occur during the pre-implantation stage of development, and during primordial germ cell development. Since the epigenetic drug therapies being developed to treat cancer target all cells, they could have a disastrous effect on germ cells or a developing embryo. Using a DNMT inhibitor drug, for example, could not only prevent silencing of a tumor suppressor gene, it could potentially also prevent silencing of intergenic regions or repetetive elements, which would impair genomic stability. In either embryonic development or gamete production, this could lead to aberrant epigenetic affects winding up in a very high percentage of cells in the adult organism. This is why these drugs have so far mostly been used on older patients for whom the risks are lower.<br /></div>
