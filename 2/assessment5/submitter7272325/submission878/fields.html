    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is a
combination of both genetic and epigenetic mistakes.  This can take the form up upregulation of oncogenes and/or
the down regulation of tumour suppressor genes and in particular involves a
change in the way that specific 
DNA sequences are methylated. 
Generally cancer is characterised overall by a general loss of
methylation with specific areas becoming more methylated.</p>

<p>In a normal cell most
of the CpG islands are unmethylated allowing the sequences to be
expressed.   Methylation of
these CpG sequences means that these sequences will be suppressed or the genes
silenced.  In cancer many of these
CpG island sequences become hypermethylated and since many CpG islands are
found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes methylation leads to
silencing of these genes that would normally suppress tumour growth.  </p>

<p>In contrast, in a
normal cell, the intergenic regions, repetitive regions and introns are usually
methylated and gene expression is suppressed at these regions.   Methylation of repetitive sequences
is particularly important in maintaining genomic stability by preventing the
illegitimate recombination of similar repeat regions.   The DNA in these regions is also maintained in a more
tightly packaged heterochromatin form that also tends to reduce genetic
expression.    In a particular
feature of cancer cells genome wide these regions become hypomethylated
allowing illegitimate recombinations.   There is a high corrreleation between genomic
instability and the lack of methylation in these regions.  Interestingly some cancers are
stimulated by the combination these 2 effects, namely an increase in
methylation supressing the expression of tumour fighting genes and a decrease
in methylation causing genome instability.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer many of the
normally monoalleleic parent based imprinted genes involved in cell growth are
found to have lost the imprinted mark. 
This leads to either silencing of both alleles or expression of both
alleles thereby contributing to 
tumour growth.  This change
in methylation patterns, either hyper or hypomethylation, is very specific to
the particular tumour type and occurs very early in the development of tumours.
</p>

<p> In a normal cell, the ICR of the
H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted. 
This methylated ICR prevents CTFC binding to the ICR and enhancers are
able to act on Igf2 causing it to be expressed.   </p>

<p>In a normal cell the
maternal allele is not imprinted (not methylated) allowing CTFC to bind to the
ICR where it acts as an insulator. 
The enhancers act on H19 but not on Igf2 which remains silent.  </p>

<p>In Wilms tumour the
ICR of both the maternal and the paternal allele are methylated so that CTFT
cannot bind to either of the alleles, the enhancers are able to act on Igf2 of
both alleles and you get twice the expression of Igf2.   Since Igf2 is a growth promoting
gene it contributes to the growth of this particular tumour type.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor (de methylating agent) used to treat
myelodysplastic syndrome.  This
inhibitor is a nucleoside analogue and is incorporated into the DNA strand when
the cell replicates.  During normal
replication DNA methyltranferase adds methyl groups to the newly synthesised
strand to maintain the methylation pattern.  When it encounters the Decitabine it binds irreversibly to
the replicating strand stopping the .methylation pattern being
re-established.    This inhibitor interferes with
maintenance of the cancer type methylation pattern following replication.  The inhibitor works best when the cell
is replicating and affects cancer cells more readily primarily because  cancer cells divide more frequently
than any other cell types.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of the
genome can have lasting effects on the DNA architecture, how compact the chromatin
is packaged, genomic stability and expression because the methylation patterns
are mitotically heritable.  Most
epigenetic patterns are laid down early in development and are faithfully maintained
throughout the life of the organism. 
If you are able to change the methylation patterns then these changes
will also be mitotically inherited. </p>

<p>A sensitive period is
the time when the epigenetic marks are being reset such as during the early
zygote period, during germ cell development and also in the early childhood
period.  Treatment with drugs that
affect the way in which epigenetic marks are established during these sensitive
periods can interfere with the way other epigenetic marks are established all
through other parts of the genome. 
The inhibitory effects could be genome wide and effect not just the part
that you would like to target with particular drug treatment but other cells leading
to unwanted side effects.</p></div>
