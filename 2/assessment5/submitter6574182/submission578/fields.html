    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands tend to occur in the
promoter regions of genes.  In general, CpG island methylation normally functions to silence the associated genes by enabling formation of
a repressive chromatin structure or by preventing the binding of
transcription factors. In cancer, the normal CpG methylation pattern
is disrupted by regional DNA hypermethylation, including at CpG
islands. This can result in silencing of associated genes including
tumour suppressor genes thereby adversely affecting cell cycle
control, apoptosis and DNA repair mechanisms thus contributing to cancer.<br /></p>

<p>The normal function of methylation in
intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic
stability by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic
splice sites.  In cancer, 	there is generally a genome-wide loss of
methylation levels.  The resulting hypomethylation can lead to
genomic instability and deregulation of gene expression including for those that code for growth factors, the deregulation of which can lead to cancer.<br /></p>
<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 complex, the paternal
allele is methylated at the imprint control region (ICR) preventing
the binding of the insulator protein CTFC to the ICR.  	The absence
of bound CFTC 	at the ICR  enables the spread of methylation to the
promoter region of the H19 gene thereby silencing it.  The lack of
CTFC also enables the enhancers downstream of the H19 gene to access
the growth factor gene Igf2 and to activate expression of Igf2. 
</p>
<p>In a normal cell,  the maternal
H19/Igf2 complex is not methylated.  Thus, the CTFC insulator protein
is able to bind to the ICR thereby blocking access to Igf2 by the
downstream enhancers and preventing expression of the maternal Igf2
allele.
</p>
<p>In Wilms' tumours, there is a loss of
imprinting of Igf2 and a resulting aberrant expression of Igf2 by both paternal
and maternal alleles .  Since Igf2 is a growth
factor, its over-expression contributes to deregulation of cell
growth and proliferation that can lead to cancers.*</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that belongs to
the class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA Methyltranferase
Inhibitors (DNMTi).  Such inhibitors are nucleoside analogues that
are incorporated into DNA during replication.  After incorporation,
these inhibitors irreversibly bind DNA methyltranferases so that, in
subsequent replication cycles, there is less DNA methyltransferase
available to methylate the daughter strands of DNA.  This results in
a global reduction in overall methylation of DNA at each replication.
 
</p>
<p>The precise mechanism of action
of drugs like Decitabine is not yet known, it is suspected that they
induce sufficient demethylation of  DNA in the tumour cells such that
previously hypermethylated tumour suppressor genes are reactivated
causing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in the tumour cells.  Since
the replication rate in tumour cells is higher than in normal cells,
tumour cells are more affected by the demethylating action of
Decitabine than normal cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns are
mitotically heritable.  Consequently, alterations in DNA methylation
will be replicated and passed to daughter cells during cell division,
and the epigenomic effects of altered methylation will endure for the
life of the organism.  Thus drugs that alter methylation of DNA can
have lasting effects that extend beyond the period of treatment.</p>
<p>Certain periods of development are
characterized by epigenetic reprogramming involving the clearing and
resetting of epigenetic marks.  These periods are referred to as
sensitive periods since there is increased sensitivity to
environmental exposures during these periods.   The sensitive periods  include the pre-implantation period of early development as
well as the period of embryonic germ cell development.
</p><p>Treatment with DNA methylation altering
drugs during these sensitive periods is inadvisable since there are  risks of inducing aberrant epigenetic reprogramming that
results in abnormal gene expression or repression and altered
imprinting patterns that adversely affect embryonic development, cell
differentiation, and growth.  Treatment with methylation altering
drugs during the epigenetic reprogramming that occurs during
development of primoridal germ cells also poses the additional risk
of producing germ line epigenetic changes that lead to abnormal
development and disease  in
subsequent generations.
