    <h1>Submission 360 from Anon (session_user_id: 026330cbb1d9b2f7c6f0ff73c78484ad508f751c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A key element in the lasting effect of epigenetic drug treatments is the mitotic heritability of epigenetic conditions. Additionally, epimutations can be reversed, meaning that long-term drug therapy may not be as necessary as in nonreversible afflictions. However, any alteration of the epigenome should take into account both the diverse effects of the epigenome, as well as its plasticity at particular times.<br /><br />Sensitive periods, aptly named, refer to specific phases in an organism's lifespan where it is especially susceptible to external influences to its epigenetic state. These two periods are the pre-implantation period where the embryo's epigenome is reset from zygote-format to a totipotent somatic/stem cell format, and later during the primordial germ cell formation. It can also be said that the germ cells exist in a permanent state of sensitivity because the epigenome of the gametes are subject to environmental influences at the time of their individual maturation, as suggested by studies exploring heritable epigenetic factors in week 5. <br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable for a number of reasons, but particularly because drug treatment at this time would coincide with changes already occurring in the epigenome and would likely result in unpredictable and undesirable effects.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-value">Methylation is typically associated with the suppression or silencing of an associated gene, and CpG islands tend to act as promoters for genes. Thus, CpG methylation will tend to silence a gene. However, this is not necessarily tied to a reduction in expression or to a particular effect; methylation may result both in the silencing of a tumor suppressor, or the overexpression of oncogenes, both of which may lead to cancer. <br /><br />The normal function of methylation at a CpG island would be to suppress a related gene, one which is probably related to excessive growth factors. In cancer, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, meaning that genes which are normally active are instead suppressed. If these suppressed factors are elements such as tumor suppressors, then cancer may be encouraged. Regions near the CpG island tend to be methylated along with the island, which may result in other genetic elements being silenced as well.<br /><br />In intergenetic regions, normal DNA methylation aids genomic stability by silencing repeats, CpG-poor promoters and other elements which, if activated, disrupt normal cell functions. In contrast to normal CpG islands, in cancer these regions tend to be hypomethylated, essentially freeing them to be expressed, and leading to genomic instability. Expressed repeats, for example, can lead to insertions, deletions and other chromosomal aberrations.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster of normal cells, the maternal and paternal allele are differently methylated and expressed. In keeping with the trend of epigenetic imprinting, the maternal allele's expression restricts growth, and the paternal allele enhances it. Disruption of these controls can lead to cancer.<br /><br />The H19/Igf2 cluster involves a series of interrelated elements: the long non-coding RNA H19, an imprinting control region, the inhibitory CTCF protein, enhancers, and the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene. The ICR is located between the Igf2 gene and H19, and exhibits an affinity for the CTCF protein when the ICR is unmethylated. <br /><br />In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated. This methylation also spreads to H19, deactivating both. This leaves nowhere for the CTCF inhibitor to attach, and the enhancers act on the Igf2 gene. <br /><br />In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated. This allows the CTCF protein to attach to it, and the CTCF prevents the enhancers from acting upon Igf2, instead forcing them to "bounce" back onto H19. <br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele's ICR is methylated as well; this results in the maternal allele acting like a paternal allele, with the ICR and H19 deactivated and the enhancers acting on Igf2. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demythlator, or hypomethylator. It acts to reduce the level of methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase; this prevents daughter cells from retaining the same (excessive) level of methylation that the treated cells possessed. This is a form of passive demethylation because the drug does not actually remove methyl groups, but rather reduces the average amount of methylation over time.<br /><br />Decitabine is directed specifically at pre-leukemic conditions, and because leukemia tends not to produce tumors in the traditional sense, Decitabine cannot necessarily be said to have an anti-tumor effect. However, its anti-cancer effect functions similarly to the way that other, more tumor-specific treatments do. By restoring normal DNA methylation, the drug may assist in halting the growth of the tumor by deactivating oncogenes, or by reactivating tumor suppressors. Tumor suppressor reactivation seems more likely since these would normally be active, and excessive methylation would deactivate them. <br /><br /></div>
