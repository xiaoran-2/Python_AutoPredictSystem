    <h1>Submission 462 from Anon (session_user_id: d4e0e6024e310a9eead2db27d8706a8d6dc38796)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent or DNMT (de novo methyl transferase) inhibitors. It will decrease or completely removed the methyl group from the histone or gene and lead to the activation.In some tumors, there are certain enzyme such as EZH2 led to overmethylation of histone or surrounding genes that are involved in tumor suppression and silence the expression of these gene which causes tumors. By providing Decitabine, it will  decrease the methylation significantly and restores their expression and function. This way Decitabine acts as anti-tumor agent.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Epigenetic regulation is different from other
form of gene regulation (such as transcription factors). Epigenetic changes are
long-lasting in a way that they are passed on cell division to daughter and
granddaughter cells until they actively erased. Once they erased, they do not
return. Thus, epigenetic therapies can affect changes that slow or stops cancer
cells from growing without killing them. Sensitive periods refer to the period
where active epigenetic reprogramming is taking place. Epigenenetic
reprogramming is important in germ cell development and early embryonic
development. Treatment with epigenetic therapies during these sensitive periods
will have altered effect on epigenetic marks during differentiation that are
long-lasting.</span><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation of the C5 position of the cytosine base at 70-80% of CpG islands. In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA. Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing. In normal cells,  CpG islands preceding gene promoters are generally unmethylated, while other individual CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome tend to be methylated. However, in cancer cells, CpG islands<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_island"></a> preceding tumor suppressor genes<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"></a> promoters are often hypermethylated, while CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions and parasitic repeat sequences is often decreased. Hypermethylation of gene promoters can result in silencing of those 
genes. This type of epigenetic mutation is dangerous when genes that 
regulate the cell cycle are silenced, allowing cells to grow and 
reproduce uncontrollably, leading to tumorigenesis.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 expression is activated in the paternal allele because without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate. Whereas in maternal allele, there will be no Igf2 activation because CTCF is an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers and lead H19 activation. The ICR at IGF2 and H19 is normally methylated on the paternal allele. Methylation is excluded from the maternal allele by CTCF binding. The presence of CTCF confers an insulator function upon the ICR, which blocks access of the IGF2 promoters to the enhancers downstream of the H19 gene. This function is lost on the methylated paternal chromosome and this enables IGF2 expression by allowing the promoters to access the enhancers. Caused by maternal allele behaving like paternal allele Such as Mutation/ deletion to cause loss of imprinting, Uniparental disomy, two copies of one parental chromosome, here paternal UPD Epigenetic disruption for loss of imprinting (rare). This led to predisposition to embryonic/childhood tumors such as Wilm's tumor (Kidney).<br /> upregulation of Igf2 is linked with oncogenesis or growth promoting.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
