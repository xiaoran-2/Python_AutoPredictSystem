    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG
islands is an epigenetic process
that is involved in regulation of
gene expression in two ways, directly
by preventing the binding of transcription factors and indirectly promoting the 'closed'
chromatin structure. It is generally
considered that methylation is a
one way process, so, when a CpG
sequence acquires novo methylation, this
modification is stable and is inherited as a
clonal methylation pattern. Moreover, the
loss of genomic methylation (hypomethylation), the disruption of DNA methylation in at CpG islands, as the primary event, is
often associated with the neoplastic process and is proportional to the severity of the disease.</p>

<p>Epigenetic events represent an important
mechanism by which gene function is selectively activated or deactivated. An
epigenetic factors affecting the cancer is called "DNA methylation",
which consists of the covalent addition of a methyl group at the fifth position
of cytosine within the cytosine of the CG base link and this is a very
important process which not only controls the expression of genes, but also the
key to the regulation of chromosomal stability. A variety of regulatory
proteins, including DNA methyltransferases, histone modifying enzymes,
chromatin remodeling factors and their multimolecular complexes are involved in
the whole epigenetic process. The previous process is done obviously in intergenic region.  As these epigenetic processes are susceptible to
change: the cancer is a example of disruption of the methylation process in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This disruption contributes to cancer, but there are also others causes: we must to clarify the involvement of the environment,
including with this diet you have, may modify the risk of cancer, but, certainly,  abnormal
methylation is the door of many types of cancers. For example: Colon, Lung,
Prostate, Breast, Leukemia, etc</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> <span>The growth factor gene II (IGF2) is overexpressed, and the mark is altered in many tumors including Wilm's tumor. The transcript is transcribed from IGF2 in reverse orientation. <span><br /></span>In
 the regulation of H19 and IGF2 genes, the paternal genome is actively 
expressed IGF2 gene by the action of enhancers or enhancers elements (E)
 present. In both the H19 gene is not expressed due to methylation on the differential methylation region (DMR) and the gene promoter. Meanwhile,
 in the maternal genome in the absence of methylation region causes the 
DMR recruitment type protein CTCF, which block the activity of the 
boosting on the Igf2 gene. <span>Thus the expression of Igf2 gene is disrupted and the activity of the boosting of H19 gene expression is favored.<br /></span>Wilms tumor appears to result from changes in one or more of at least 10 genes. The WT1 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p13). The normal function of WT1 is required for normal development and is important genitourinary differentiation of renal tissue.</span> When the imprinting at the H19/lgf2 clusters is disrupted, Wilm's toumour appears, but the WT1 gene is other important cause.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> Research and development based on epigenetics as decitabine, drugs is one of the most promising fields of the epigenetic studies. These drugs allow an adequate  gene expression. Decitabine is a critical drug:  Interactions between histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) and decitabine<span> produces a synergistic effect in growth inhibition and induction of 
apoptosis in DLBCL cells. This effect was time dependent, mediated via 
caspase-3 activation, and resulted in increased levels of acetylated 
histones.  This is a real impac of Decitabine on DNA methylation,  as how we have seen anwering the prevous questions, there are regions  that exhibit greater methylation in the genes and this biochemical process seemed to occur only in tumor cells. This chemical change acts as a switch that turns off tumor suppressor genes.</span>  The interactions HDACIs/decitabine avoid this chemical change and this is the reason that the  Decitabine have an anti-tumour effect.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> <span>The
 goal of epigenetic therapy is to "reprogram" the chain of chemical 
changes that affect the DNA of cancer cells.  This reprogramming may alter the activity of key genes in cancer cells that control their growth and survival. Treatments can effectively restore DNA methylation. However,
 the framework configures the new epigenetic medicine is much broader 
and considers the different gene variants, in which the presence of an 
allele or other means only some difference, however small, in relation 
to a particular function, and also
 considers combinations of multiple variants, treated individually, may 
not have functional effect but in combination also includes new 
properties determine the metabolic history of each person and periods of
 hypersensitivity to exposure of different factors along the different 
stages of
 life (epigenetic), so the medicine can act on  epigenetic 
sensitivity period and continue beyond these periods when reprogramming 
has occurred and affect all phenotypic levels for a long term.</span> But the effect duration is a discussed question.<br /></div>
