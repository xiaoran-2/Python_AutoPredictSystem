    <h1>Submission 333 from Anon (session_user_id: 5cb80a645362ec802cf223637ecbf5a15a2b719e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer, some enzymes are overexpressed which can methylate histones and therefore, silence genes such as tumor suppressors. If a tumor suppressor gets silenced, it can lead to an advantage for cancer to develop. A DNA-demethylating agent (or DNA methylation inhibitor) such as Decitabine would demethylate the silenced suppresor genes and therefore, avoid cancer to develop.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation patterns are altered in cancer. In normal cells, CpG islands are unmethylated, while intergenic regions, repetitive elements and in introns are methylated. In cancer cells, these patterns are swapped, so the CpG islands are methylated and repetitive elements, introns and intergenic regions are hypomethylated.  <br />The normal function of CpG islands within the promoters is to regulate the transcription of certain genes. When the genes involved are tumor suppressor genes, a highly methylated CpG islands (shown in cancer) can lead to the silence of that gene, which contributes to cancer development. <br />For intergenic regions and repetitive elements, normal cells show high methylation patterns which produces a condensed chromatin and avoid recombination between different chromosomes. If the DNA is not densely packed within repetitive elements (as shown in cancer cells), those elements can recombine with other repetitive elements in other chromosomes, which results in genomic instability and contributes to the activation of repeats, of cryptic promoters, the disruption of genes, activation of protooncogenes, transpositions, deletions and insertions. That genomic instability favors the development of cancer due to the oncogene dose increment and a minimized sumor suppressor action.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The loss of imprinting can lead to cancer when the control region altered is involved in gowth.<br />In healthy tissue, the methylation pattern of the paternal allele of the H19/Ifg2 cluster shows a methylated H19 control region which avoids H19 to be expressed and the enhancers act over Igf2 (growth signaling). For the maternal allele, the control region is not methylated and the enhancers bind to the H19 region and is expressed, Igf2 is not expressed. <br />In Wilm's tumor, the control region for H19 expression is methylated in the maternal allele (like the paternal allele in normal tissue), which conduces to a expression of Igf2 and leads to a double dose of growth signal. <br />A double dose of growth signal contributes to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes are passed throughout cell division until they are actively erased, those changes can lead to an increased sentitive to chemotherapy once the drug has altered the epigenome of the cell. <br />Altered methylation patterns can lead to a loss of expression of tumor suppressors and therefore, develop cancer. <br />During the period in which all the epigenetic marks are resetted (sensitive period) it would be inadvisable to treat patients because some undesirable epigenetic marks would be altered too, which can lead to other kind of diseases and/or favor cancer (overexpression of protooncogenes). During that sensitive period, the epigenome is more vulnerable to insults during early embryonic development and gametogenesis for both males and females, and during oocyte development in females which occurs until they reach puberty.</div>
