    <div class="field-value">In DNA methylation, a methyl group is added to a C or A DNA nucleotide. However, CpG sites are typically where methylation occurs (when a C base is followed by phosphate, and then a G base). CpG islands are clusters of this CpG sites. Methylation is usually associated with gene silencing, but CpG islands are exceptions. Usually they are kept free of methylation regardless of whether they are promoted or silenced. <br /><br />
During cancer, promoter CpG islands can become hypermethylated, which instead causes silencing of the gene. <br />
Tumour suppressor genes are silenced in these instances, which enables the growth of cancer. <br /><br />
Usually in intergenic regions methylation is found within repetitive elements and results in silencing.
<br />
During cancer these regions are usually hypomethylated. <br /><br />
This hypomethylation causes genomic instability. This is as recombination can occur when euchromatin is not open, which is the case when regions are hypomethylated. Because the repetitive elements are identical in places between different chromosomes, these areas can recombinate with other chromosomes, instead of their homologues. When hypomethylated, these repeats can also further repeat themselves. The genomic instability can end up in gene activation, which can have the effect of targeting tumour suppression, enabling cancerous cells to grow even further.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, there are four main sections to consider: the Igf2 promoter, the imprinting control region (ICR, affected by the CTCF insulator protein), the H19 promoter and the enhancers. In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated which blocks binding of CTCF, and allows methylation to spread to the H19 promoter, which in turn allows the enhancers to activate Igf2. In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, allowing CTCF binding, which does not allow methylation to spread to the H19 promoter. The LncRNA H19 is produced, and enhancers are blocked from reaching the Igf2 promoter by CTCF. <br /><br />
In Wilm's tumour, both alleles act as the paternal allele, promoting Igf2, which is an oncogene, as it promotes growth. It also means that Cdkn1c isn't produced, which inhibits growth in the maternal expression. This is how imprinting disruptions can promote growth and result in cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-methylating agent, inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. This reduces overall amounts of DNA methylation in the patient, stabilising methylation in hematopoietic stem cells. This results in an anti-tumour effect as tumour suppressor genes may be activated, allowing more control over cell growth, and therefore better prevention of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation not only affects that individual cell, but also any daughter cells it propagates, as epigenetic marks are inherited. <br /><br />
A sensitive period is when the organism is particularly sensitive to the effects of epigenetics, including methylation. These sensitive periods are during germ cell development, gestation and early development. <br /><br />
Treating patients during these vulnerable periods could have life-long effects on the methylation of their genomes. Very young/infant patients and pregnant patients shouldn't be treated with epigenetic drugs as the effects of the treatment would be unknown and potentially damaging.
