    <div class="field-value">In cancer cells there are two type of altered methylation. It can either be locus specific hypermethylation (inactivation of tumor suppressors) and genom-wide hypomethylation (which makes open repetitive regions for transciption) and these cases occurs usually at the same time. Hypermethylated CGIs differ by tumor type.<br />In normal cells CpG islands tend to be hypomethylated while repetiteive elements, intergenic regions and introns are methylated. Cancer cells are the opposite. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so inactivation of tumor suppressors can spread rapidly.<br />Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements cause genomic instability. This can occur in effects like deletions from the genom, translocations of the repetitive elements (which can distrupt neighbouring genes) or insertions. We know this occufrs from either human diseases (i.e. mutations in DNMT3B) and from most human cancers.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">At the H19/Igf2 cluster the Imprinting region is normally unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. DNA methylation at the ICR spread downstream. So the H19 lnRNA is expressed only from the maternal allele. This is a reservoir for the micro RNA which is an enhancer for Igf2. If the imprinting region is unmathylated it will be bound by CTCF protein which blocks enhancing the Igf2. <br />If the maternal allele got methylated (i.e. imprinting disorders) it will act like a second paternal allele which will lead to upregulation of Igf2 which is an oncogene, and will cause the shut down of the Cdkn1c gene which is a tumor supressor. This uniparental disomy can cause Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome and it can cause childhood's tumour like Wilm's tumour in the kidney.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an DNMT inhibitor. It's used in myeloplastic syndrome which is precursor of AML (acute myelogenous leukemia). In tumour-cells the tumour spuressor genes are inactiveted by methylation of these genes. By using DNMT inhibitors (i.e. Decitabine) after mitosis in the daughter these regions will be unmethylated (as in normal cells), so the tumour suressor gene will be active again.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so setting the right methylation pattern will affect the daughter cells as well even after the end of the medication.<br />A sensitive period is when alternation in the environment have effect on the epigenetic control. These are the from period of the primordial germ cell development to the period of mature gametes the other period if from pre implatation to early post implantation period. These are the time of reestablishing of the epigenetic marks. But other sensitive periods can occur in a tissue-specific way. <br />It's inadvised to threat patients (pregnant mothers) in these periods because establishing the right epigenetic pattern is a must to have a healthy person. And at this moment it's difficult to make drugs that enhances or inhibits a specific targeted gene, so the consequences will be severe while there will be no guarantee for a gain.<br /></div>
