    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA <b>methylation</b><span> is a key concept in <b>cell differentiation</b>. It is simply
methyl group binding to cytosine or adenine nucleotides. It is normally
permanent and unidirectional mechanism. In addition to cell differentiation it
is important for X-chromosome inactivation, repetitive genes suppression and
also maintenance of imprinted genes and formation of heterochromatin. </span></p>

<p><span>CpG islands are mostly in or near promoters and usually they are kept
free of methylation. Methylation of a CpG island will inactivate related gene
and result is loss of function of this gene. The consequences will depends on which
gene functions are lost (can be tumor or repetitive gene suppression gene).
(Sometimes single gene can do same effect with mutation. (e.g. BRCA1 in breast
cancer, RB in retinoblastoma) In <b>a
normal cell CpG islands are mostly </b></span><b>unmethylated</b><b> but repetitive elements, intergenic regions,
introns and CpG poor promoters mostly methylated. In a cancer cell it is vice
versa</b>. Consequences of these disruptions are: </p>

<p>a) Shortly genomic instability (illegitimate recombination between
repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic
promoters and disruption of neighboring genes)</p>

<p><span> b) Expression or repression of
microRNA's, LncRNA's which means global disruption in the cell epigenetic
system.</span></p>

<p>c) Loss of DNA repair functions. </p>

<p>d) Loss of imprinting which results overdose (lack of dose) because of
expression (or repression) of both parental alleles </p>

<p>e) Loss of growth restricting genes, </p>

<p>f) Over expression growth promoting genes. </p>

<p><span>In summary, disrupted methylation means disrupted gene expression or
repression. This disruption triggers new disruptions.  e.g. hypomethylated intergenic region mislead enhancers’,
Suppressed repetitive elements starts to be over expressed, double dose (lack
of dose) occurred because of loss of imprinting causes new disruptions. </span></p><p><span>Not only one of it but mostly their total of theese effects leads the cell to cancer and cancer also leads new disruptions.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The <i>IGF2</i> gene
makes a protein called insulin-like growth factor 2 and very active during
fetal growth and childhood not very active in adult body. One of inherited  IGF2 copy is (mostly maternal) inactive.</span></p><p><span>Another gene H19 is also involved in growth and development. Normally, if
IGF2 is active the H19 on the  nearby region is methylated.  Other parental gene is vice versa. It is
important because in case of unmethylated H19 enhancers nearby activate the inactive
IGF2 .That means loss of imprinting, Active IGF2 of maternal and paternal. </span></p><p>In another words (mostly)
inactive maternal IGF2 combination with methylated H19 misleads enhancers
nearby to activate IGF2. As (mostly) paternal IGF2 is already active both
parental IGF2’s which are growth related functioning.</p><p>





</p><p><span>Over expression of
growth promoting genes leads wilm’s cancer. It is childhood cancer because this
gene is not very active in adulthood.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Methyltransferases are enzymes
that the keys of methylation. Despite its vital importance hypo or hyper methylation
can be described as epigenetic mutation which may lead to cancer.</span></p><p>Epigenetic
mutations are reversible and hypermethyletion can be reverse by inhibiting <span>methyltransferases. So we call  the drugs inhibiting methyltransferases as </span>DNA-demethylating/hypo methylating (abbreviated as DNMTi)
agents.</p><p>Decitabine
is a DNMTi agent and approved by FDA for use myelodysplastic syndrome.</p><p>Cancer
cells dividing much more rapidly Decitabine effects on division and the way it
makes it binding to methyltransferase.</p><p>







</p><p><span>Actually, DNMTi drugs first started to be used in 70’s but with maximum doses.
Today, It is clear very far to toxic doses have maximum effect and it is a very
important. In future combination with other epigenetic drugs and or with
classic chemotherapy (with lower doses) may be more beneficial.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Let's remember Dutch famine case. Boys and girls environment (at the
cerm cell development stage) have effect on grandchildren’s.<br />
If we describe epigenetically sensitive
periods with daily life words: Young boys and girl (approx. 8-12 years) during
cerm cell development and early days of pregnancy (balastocyst). Methylation of
paternal and maternal genome happens between blastocyst to epyblast stage. But
during the primordial germ cell development stage, not only paternal and
maternal genome but also imprinted genes are being methylated.</span></p><p>As DNA methylation is very important
gene regulatory process and happens a lot during sensitive periods, to
interfere to natural methylation or sustain very marginal environments may lead
unexpected epigenetic situations.</p><p>



</p><p><span>Again in very easily understandable
words: If smoking, or famine may have effect on cerm cells during developmental
stage or in adequate folic acid intake of mother just before pregnancy and/or
early days of pregnancy may cause hydrocephalus (may be nor very good example
as it is not purely epigenetic illness) much heavy chemicals or epigenetically
touches in these periods may lead not very desirable situations.</span></p></div>
