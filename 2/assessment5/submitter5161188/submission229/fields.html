    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Methylation of DNA as a means of controlling gene expression in eukaryotic cells was discovered in the 1970s.  Mammalian cells are normally hypomethylated at CpG islands, while cancer cells are known to be hypermethylated in these regions.  Tumor suppressor genes (TSG) located near hypomethylated CpG islands are expressed normally, thus limiting cell division and growth.  When the CpG islands are hypermethylated, as is the case in cancer cells, TSG expression may be silenced, resulting in uninhibited growth and division of cells, leading to cancer.  SIngle genes, sets of genes, and CPG island shores may be hypermethylated, leading to different forms of cancer.  CpG island hypermethylation is considered a biomarker for cancer, as hypermethylation can be detected in single genes and gene clusters.</span></p>
<p>In contrast, genome-wide in normal mammalian DNA, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated, as this lends genomic stability to DNA.  When these regions are hypomethylated, as demonstrated in mouse and human models, genomic instability can occur as hypomethylated DNA tends to be less densely packed, allowing illegal recombinations or breaks to take place in areas where they would not ordinarily occur.  This results in misalignment, deletion, translocation or insertion of chromosomal material.  Repetitive regions may be copied and moved around, activating genes that ordinarily would not be active, or silencing those that might normally be active.  These events can lead to aberrant, tumorigenic outcomes, from uninhibited cell growth or excessive/reduced protein production.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In a limited number of mammalian genes, some are marked (“imprinted”) the same as their parent allele, limiting the expression of one of them (typically, both parental alleles contribute to expression).  Parent-of-origin imprint control region (ICR) methylation determines the expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) in humans.  </span></p>
<p>On the paternal allelle, ICR methylation blocks the binding of an insulator/regulatory protein, CTCF.  This methylation spreads to the nearby H19 promoter region, silencing it, allowing downstream enhancers to stimulate Igf2 expression.  On the maternal allele, the unmethylated ICR allows CTCF protein to bind it, which also leaves the H19 region unmethylated. The enhancers stimulate H19 expression, and the Igf2 gene is left unexpressed.  </p>
<p><span>The loss of imprinting (LOI) at the maternal allele (ICR now methylated, unlike the parent of origin) results in a concommittant silencing of H19 and expression of Igf2.  Combined with Igf2 from paternal expression, a double dose of Igf2 results, leading to Wilm’s tumor, an uncontrolled growth of kidney tumors in children (rarely seen in adults).  </span></p>
<p>Loss of imprinting - ICR hyper- or hypomethylation leading to misregulated gene expression - is seen in a number of tumor types, and is likely an early event in tumorigenicity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation plays a role in altering gene expression.  An increase in DNA methylation can silence tumor suppressor genes which are responsible for inhibiting cell division and growth.  If suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, resulting in tumor growth.</span></p><p>Decitabine, a cytidine analogue currently approved for use against blood/bone marrow cancers, belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). Decitabine’s mode of action begins with the inclusion of Decitabine into DNA strands as cell replication occurs (thus the effect is dependent on cell division taking place).  When DNMT1 proceeds to methylate a DNA strand with included Decitabine, the DNMT1 enzyme is covalently bonded to the Decitabine, thus preventing the DNMT1 from doing its primary job; eventually, hypomethylation results.  The resultant lack of methylation unblocks tumor suppressor genes, so cell division and growth is regulated.  This is effectively an anti-tumor effect, disallowing unrestricted growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation alterations via epigenetic drugs may change tumor cells by allowing them to be more sensitive to standard chemotherapeutic drugs.  This may happen as drug-induced epigenetic changes can be passed on to daughter cells during somatic cell division (unless removed).  It is possible that epigenetic drug changes may be reactivating previously silenced cancer suppressing genes, and thus allowing standard chemotherapies to have a better effect, perhaps at lower doses.</span></p>
<p><span>DNA methylation plays a critical role in gene expression and cell differentiation, moderating expression of particular genes in embryonic development and specific cell types.  Sensitive periods exist in which the transmission of methylation must be suppressed or retained for the proper development of an organism.  In particular, there is increased sensitivity to methylation’s regulatory effects during the development of the pre-implantation blastocyst and the primordial germ cells of a developing embryo or young child.</span></p>
<p><span>Where epigenetic misregulation has occurred during somatic growth periods, epigenetic drug treatments have been developed.  While the primary aim of treatment is patient survival, care must be taken since there can be effects on the embryonic primordial germ cells or the developing germ cells of younger patients.</span></p></div>
