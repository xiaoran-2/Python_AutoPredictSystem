    <h1>Submission 372 from Anon (session_user_id: 487672db5fcd740311a4d9b9891f4839e34d1b12)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, acts as DNA demethylation agents, it inhibits DNA methylltranferase and therefore lowers the level of DNA methylation. In cancers that characterized by hypermethylated CpGs and low expression of tumour suppressor genes, it might be quite useful to inhibit the methylation of CpGs and reactivate tumour suppressor genes. As this epigenetic drug requires division to be active it is probably that it would be more active on the rapidly divided cancer cells. required doses are very low which reduce the toxicity and undesirable side effects, on the other hand the epigenetic effect when achieved in a cancer cell it will pass through division to the daughter cells until the cell is erased, and this cell will not return, which is quite useful to avoid recurrence. It is worth mentioning that Decitabine is already FDA approved drug to treat Myelodysplastic syndrom MPD. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation status varies between different parts of the genome, at the CpGs islands of the promoter most of the Cytosine residues (CIMP_ are usually unmethylated, and this is necessary but not enough for the expression of these genes, but in Cancer most of the cytosines at CpG islands (CIMP) become methylated, but this methylation state varies according to the cell type, besides the DNA methylation of the promoters increases as the cancer progress. The methylation of the promoter make the gene less active and inhibit the expression of these genes which are probably tumour suppressor genes which help the cancer cells to survive, this epigenetic is also mitotically heritable and these cells are more likely to survive. <br />The opposite happen in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, these regions are normally highly methylated, this is important to provide genome stability, and avoid the insertions of these repeats in different places of the gene, and to inhibit the transposones and other phenomenas of genetic instability. In cancer, these regions become generally less methylated and therefore more likely to be active, this  induce genomic instability, which include the activation of many oncogenes and cryptic promoters, as well as the activation of delete or insert elements in the genome, besides the llegitimate recombination between repeats, and these all contribute to the instability that characterises the cancer cells.  <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 cluster is one of the imprinted genes, normally in the paternal allele, the imprinting control region (IRCs) is methylated and therefore the protein CTCF is unable to bind this region, and the H19 is also methylated and not expressed, and this allow the distal enhancer to enhance the expression of Igf2, on contrast in the the maternal allele the ICRs region is unmethylated, the CTCF rpotein binds to this region and the enhancer work on the H19 therefore H19 is favourably expressed and Igf2 remains silenced. <br />in Wilms tumor both allels act as a paternal allele, therefore in both allele the ICRs is methylated and the CTCF is unable to bind the ICRs and therefore H19 is suppressed and the  expression of Igf2 is allowed to be enhanced by the distal enhancer in both allels , this happen as a very early event in the Wilms tumourogenesis events, and this might contribute to the formation of cancer through double the expression of Igf2 which consider a growth enhancer and decrease the expression of H19 which consider as a growth suppressor.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic mechanisms, particularly DNA methylation, known to be mitotically inheritable, which means while the drug has altered the DNA methylation in a cell, this alteration would pass through generations to daughter and grand daughter cells, so when the treatment stops after the epigenetic marks are altered, the new alteration would pass through division even in the absence of the drug. <br />A sensitive period is a period of major changes in the epigenetic marks, like the epigenetic reprogramming when all the epigenetic marks need to be erased and then set up again. This include the early development after fertilization and the gametogenesis, it might also include the differentiation of cells like in the haematogenesis progenitor differentiation. the early development is a sensitive period, as in this period many factors including cytokines and transcription factors contribute to the lineage specific development and every lineage has a specific set of epigenetic marks, this is particularly sensitive period and using drugs with epigenetic effect might lead to abnormalities in cell's differentiation and therefore long term developmental abnormalities, and this might associated with severe dysfunction or be a life threatening. </div>
