    <div class="field-value">The function of DNA methylation is to silence gene expression, through the addition of a methyl group at the fifth carbon of the cytosine. In CpG islands, DNA methylation leads to transcriptional silencing when is found at promoters of genes. However, in normal cells, the majority of CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation. On the contrary, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are found methylated in normal cells, in order to maintain genomic integrity (for example, by preventing transposition of repetitive elements). In cancer cells, the opposite occurs, since the CpG islands are found hypermethylated and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are found hypomethylated.<br />The hypermethylation of CpG islands causes silencing of the underlying genes, which generally, tends to be tumour supressor genes. This is because CpG islands hypermethylated are found, in general, in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. These genes control processes like the cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair. Therefore, their expression silencing can result in excessive cell proliferation and leads to cancer development. The hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements can also contributes to cancer development, because it is associated with genomic instability. In fact, the hypomethylation of these regions/elements can result in a recombination between repeats, transposition and/or activation of cryptic promoters which disrupt neighboring genes (for example, growth genes). Consequently, these mistakes results in the accumulation of deletions, translocations or insertions and, thus, chromosomal instability. According to Knudson hypothesis, the development of cancer involves multiple modifications into DNA, being DNA methylation one of the hits required to tumour development. <span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The <i>Igf2 </i>is a growth promoting gene that demonstrates monoallelic expression. In a normal cell, the maternal allele shows the Imprint Control Region (ICR) unmethylated. Thus, CTCF, which is an insulator protein, is able to bind to the ICR and prevent the access of the <i>Igf2</i> gene to the enhancers that are located downstream of the <i>H19 </i>gene. This leads to the access of the enhancers to <i>H19 </i>promoter, which increases <i>H19 </i>expression, and silences <em>Igf2 </em>expression. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, which prevents the CTCF binding. Also, the ICR methylation spreads to the promoter of the <i>H19 </i>gene, silencing its expression. Therefore, the enhancers can access <i>Igf2 </i>and activate its expression. In cancer cells, the ICRs are found hypo or hypermethylated. Because many of the imprinted genes are associated with growth, the loss or overexpression of these genes can contribute to cancer, by promoting an uncontrolled cell growth. The Wilm's tumour is an example of ICR hypermethylation and involves the H19/Igf2 cluster. In this tumour, the maternal ICR is also found methylated. This leads to the expression of both <em>Igf2 </em>alleles and therefore an overexpression of this gene. Consequently, promotes excessive cell growth and cancer development.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferases inhibitors (DNMTi) class and, therefore, its function is to inhibit DNMT. Decitabine, like others DNMTi, is a replication dependent nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into DNA. Then, during cell replication, it is recognized by the DNMTs, however the binding of the DNMT to the nucleoside is irreversible and leads to its inhibition. This results in DNA demethylation along cell divisions and the possible reactivation of the expression of tumour suppressor genes, for example. Because cancer cells proliferate rapidly, they are more severely affected by this compound. Decitabine constitutes a therapy to induce DNA demethylation and reduce cell proliferation in tumours where DNA hypermethylation prevails, for example.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because epigenetic alterations like DNA methylation are reversible and mitotically heritable (they are inherited through cell divisions), any effect on DNA methylation caused by a drug can have long-term effects and last beyond the period of treatment. Considering this, it may be inadvisable to treat younger patients, like those where germ cells are developing, with these drugs. This is because  the development of germ cells constitutes a sensitive period. Sensitive periods are the periods of epigenetic reprogramming, namely the early embryonic development and the primordial germ cell development periods. Thus, since these drugs do not have specific targets, any alteration induced by them during these periods are passed on through cell division and can result in negative long-term effects (epigenetic abnormalities). Additionally, alterations on primordial germ cells may have the potential to affect the offspring (transgenerational effects).</div>
