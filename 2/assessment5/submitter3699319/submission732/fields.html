    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA is normally <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">hypomethylated</span> at CpG islands in
the promoter region of a gene. This hypomethylation at the CpG islands in the promoter
region of the gene allows the gene to be expressed under normal situation.
<span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">Hypomethylation</span> can be found in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes
(TSG), which normally remains active and prevent cancer by suppressing the
growth of the tumors. <br /><br />
However, in cancerous condition, DNA methylation at the CpG islands is disrupted.
This disruption could arise stochastically due to loss of fidelity or mutation
in the <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">epigenetic</span> enzymes like DNMT1, or DNMT3a/b. There is locus specific DNA
hypermethylation and a genome wide hypomethylation. There is hypermethylation of
the CpG islands in the promoter region of the TSG which inhibits its
expression. Due to inhibition of the TSG, there is no control over the growth
of the cells, due to which cells keep on dividing rapidly and it would ultimately
result in the cancer. There is also methylation of the CpG island shores.<br /><br />
In contrast to the CpG islands, DNA is <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">hypermethylated</span> at the intergenic region
and the repetitive elements in the normal cells. This <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">hypermethylation</span> at the
intergenic and repetitive elements prevents genomic instability by silencing
those regions under normal conditions. <br /><br />
However, in cancer cells, there is global hypomethylation seen at the intergenic
and the repetitive elements. This decrease in the <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">methylation</span> at the intergenic
and repetitive elements leads to the genomic instability due to the activation
of repetitive elements which would result in a gain (insertion) or loss
(deletion) of a chromosome, it may also cause illegitimate recombination like
reciprocal translocation, activates cryptic promoters and, it may activate the
transposons which may disrupt the coding genes and activate the neighboring
genes, which eventually leads to the cancerous condition.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption in the <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">methylation</span> levels also leads
to the loss of imprinting which can result in cancer. <span>In normal cells, IGF2 is expressed
from the paternal allele only. In the paternal allele, the imprint control region
(ICR) is methylated due to which the CTCF protein cannot bind to the ICR.
Therefore, the enhancers downstream bind directly to the IGF2 and lead to its
expression from the paternal allele. <br /><br />
H19, in normal cells is expressed from the maternal allele only. In maternal
allele, the ICR is <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">unmethylated</span> which leads to the binding of the CTCF protein to
the ICR. This binding of the CTCF blocks the enhancers from attaching to the IGF2,
and therefore enhancers now attach to the H19 and helps in the H19 expression.</span></p>

<span>However, in Wilm’s tumor, at the IGF2/H19 gene cluster
there is <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">methylation</span> of the ICR in the maternal allele, due to which it acts
like a paternal allele, as CTCF isn’t able to bind to the ICR. Therefore, now
both the copies i.e. <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">maternal</span> and paternal express IGF2. Since IGF2 is involved
in the cell growth, it’s over expressed now, which will lead to the increased
cell growth and hence to <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">tumorigenesis.</span></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span><span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">Decitabine</span> belongs to the class of DNA methyl
transferase inhibitor (DNMTi) drugs. <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">DNMTi</span> are nucleoside analogues. <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">Decitabine</span>
brings about the hypomethylation of the CpG islands, and thereby leads to the
activation of the silent tumor suppressor gene (TSG). <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">Decitabine</span> acts by
getting incorporated into the DNA when the DNA is <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">replicating</span>. After its
incorporation into the DNA, when the DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) comes to
bind to the nucleotide, in order to copy the <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">methylation</span> to the daughter strands,
Decitabine binds irreversibly to the DNMT and thereby prevent <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">methylation</span> of
the daughter strand and ultimately leads to the gene expression by bringing
about hypomethylation of the CpG islands. The anti-neoplastic action of DNMTi
is replication dependent i.e. <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">the</span> cell should be <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">replicating</span>. As cancer cells divide
at a much rapid rate than the normal cells, they would be more severely
affected as they are replicating more. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>When drugs that alter the DNA methylation levels
like DNA methyl transferase inhibitors are administered they have lasting
effects. The reason for this effect is due to the fact that the <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">epigenetic</span>
effects are mitotically heritable. Once the <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">epigenetic</span> effects are erased
through drugs, the altered <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">epigenetic</span> changes are then <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">mitotically</span> inherited, and
hence the lasting effect is seen. <br /><br />
Sensitive period is a time during embryonic
development during which an organism is most sensitive to any change in its environmental
factors (both external and internal) which may have a profound influence on its
development. Embryogenesis and the primordial germ cell development are two
important sensitive periods in development of an organism. During these
sensitive periods epigenetic reprogramming occurs and the <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">epigenetic</span> marks are
laid again. <br /><br />
Any drug that interferes with the sensitive period would affect the normal embryonic
development. Some <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">epigenetic</span> marks like IAP repetitive elements remain
methylated during the development. If any drug (like DNA methyl transferase
inhibitors) which alters the <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">epigenetic</span> state is given during this period, it
would lead to the hypomethylation of those repeats, which would lead to genomic
instability, illegitimate recombination, activation of transposons and would
thereby have an adverse effect on the embryo. </span></div>
