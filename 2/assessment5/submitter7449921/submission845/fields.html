    <div class="field-value"><div>The DNA methylation has shown as a vital to healthy growth and development and is collerate to various processes such as genomic imprinting, carcinogenesis and the suppression of repetitive elements. DNA methylation is the formation of the chromatin structure, which enables a single cell to grow into a complex multicellular organism made up of different tissues and organs.</div><div>Researchers have been described that DNA methylation refers to the addition of a methyl (CH3) group to the cytosine or guanine nucleotide. This methyl group may be added to the fifth carbon atom of the cytosine base or the sixth nitrogen atom of the adenine base. For instance, in somatic cells, DNA methylation usually occurs at a CpG site, which is a sequence of DNA where cytosine is located next to guanine. </div><div>Among mammals, around 60-90% of all CpGs are methylated. Methylated C residues lose an amine group to give T residues. Moreover, the CpG dinucleotides therefore mutate into TpG dinucleotides. Unmethylated CpG residues can also lose an amine group, to give a uracil residue, but this mutation is quickly recognized and fixed.</div><div>Several studies reported that CpGs which is unmethylated are often found in groups called CpG islands, located at the 5’ regulatory region of genes. Many cancer and other diseases processes often begin when these islands undergo hypermethylation, leading to transcriptional silencing, which can be passed on to daughter cells during cell division.</div><div>In conclusion, alteration of the DNA methylation therefore forms an important first step in the development of cancer. Studies have shown that genes with a promoter region that contains a high concentration of 5-methylcytosine are transcriptionally silent. Aberrant methylation of DNA has been associated with an increased rate of malignancy. DNA hypermethylation is linked to the activation of genes and DNA hypomethylation has been associated with the development of cancer through various mechanisms.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>H19 contains a differentially methylated region that is also an imprinting control region. This imprinting control region is differentially methylated at its CpGs according to parental inheritance. Usually, the paternal copy of H19 is methylated and silent while the maternal copy is hypomethylated or unmethylated and expressed in the offspring cell. Methylation of the H19 promoter is negatively correlated with H19 expression.</div><div>As methylation of the promoter reaches 100%, H19 expression from that promoter approaches 0. At the same time as H19 expression decreases, the expression of IGF2, a neighboring gene on chromosome 11, increases. Many research studies reported that chromatin looping interactions between CTCF sites at the human IGF2-H19 locus are stabilized by cohesin in an adult breast epithelial cell line.  Many studies demonstrated utilizing BWS and SRS LCLs derived from patients with pUPD and methylation defects at the ICR has enabled not just for assign specific patterns of histone modifications and chromatin looping profiles to maternal or paternal alleles and but also to determine the influence of the ICR on chromatin conformation at the locus. For example, it can be able to demonstrate that in humans, as in the mouse, histone modifications mark the IGF2-H19 ICR in a parent of origin-specific manner, with the permissive H3K4me2 and H3K9ac on the non-DNA-methylated maternal allele.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent and It has shown to hypomethylates DNA by the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. Functionally, Decitabine is working in a similar manner to azacitidine, however, decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains. In safety issues, decitabine was found to be well tolerated, with a manageable toxicity profile. </div><div>The Decitabine is a cytosine nucleoside analog which in turn once incorporated into DNA, inhibits more DNA methylation. As a consequence, aberrantly silenced genes, including tumor suppressor genes, can be reactivated and expressed. Numerous studies indicated that Decitabine has activity in a broad range of hematologic disorders, including MDS, acute myelogenous leukaemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and sickle cell anemia. Decitabine also may be effective in patients with other hematologic malignancies such as AML and CML, and in various malignancies in which hypermethylation and tumor suppressor gene silencing may play a role.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Initially, Epigenetic alterations are heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes in DNA sequence, with the broadest definition such as all factors other than DNA sequence changes which is heritably influence gene expression. In fact, the best described of these mechanisms is DNA methylation, other epigenetic mechanisms include physical and chemical changes to chromatin and regulation of gene expression by microRNA.</div><div>A considerable amount of literature has been published on <span>DNA methylation </span>to assess the response and toxicity of treatment with HAs in patients with RI. In addition, researcher has been also described that treatment with HAs was feasible and most patients were able to tolerate them at standard doses. So dose reductions and treatment interruptions were required in some patients, particularly in those with severe RI. However, the interpretation of these results must take into account the limitations of the retrospective nature of studies. </div><div>In summary, therefore, Most patients did not require dose reductions at the beginning of treatment. Because pharmacokinetic studies were not performed and we analysed two agents with different metabolic and excretion pathways, we were unable to determine which subset of patients needed dose adjustments at the start of therapy because of renal impairment.<br /></div></div>
