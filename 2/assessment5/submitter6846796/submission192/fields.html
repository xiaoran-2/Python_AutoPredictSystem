    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the Economist article "Cancer's epicentre", decitabine is introduced as a epigenetic drug that is proposed to act through demethylation. Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. Cancers have been associated with methylation, often silencing tumor suppressor genes. This allows the cancer to alter cell functioning and progress. Decitabine has been proposed to remove methylation, hence can potentially revert the methylation of tumor suppressor genes or other anti-tumor genes. Demethylation of DNA may occur by blocking the laying of methyl groups such as by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases, by increasing the concentration of demethyltransferases, or by removing the methyl group directly. Reactivation of genes silenced by the tumor state may have drastic effects on the tumor cell functioning - an anti-tumor effect. As the cancer cell aims to suppress anti-tumor genes through silencing, re-methylation of silenced regions may reactivate DNA binding domains, tumor suppressor genes and growth limiting genes which provides the anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is most generally associated with silencing of downstream genes when located at the promoter. However, often at promoters we find unmethylated islands containing a cytosine and guanine combination - a CpG island. Usually hypomethylated in a healthy cell, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands often become hypermethylated. Hypermethylated CpG islands alter gene expression by binding CpG binding proteins with a new binding domain, MeCP1 and MeCP2, or by prohibiting transcription factor binding. Methylation of the CpG islands silences further downstream gene expression - switching the cell's epigenetic state to a less dynamic one. Less differentiated gene expression enhances the stem-cell attributes of cancer cells. DNA methylation in the host cell also down regulates genes associated with natural limitations and cell growth, allowing the cancer cell to perform abnormally. </p>
<p>Whilst DNA methylation is low at CpG islands, it is high at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Here, DNMT1 causes DNA methylation and maintains the genomic integrity of the cell. Methylation silences repetitive elements to prevent transposition, plus silences the transcription of genetic start sites so there is no overlap, recombination or interference. In cancer, these intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated. Expressing these regions may be mutagenic; repetitive elements expressed are pasted elsewhere in the genome where they may be disruptive; intergenic regions control neighboring genes whose expression may become abnormal. <br /></p><p>Information derived from: </p><p>Blewitt, Marnie. 2014.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at imprint control regions (ICRs) forms a basis for imprinting of genetic expression. ICR methylation can silence or activate genes in the cluster. The H19/Igf2 imprinting cluster is located on human chromosome 11, to which insulator protein CTCF can bind. On the maternal allele (MA), the unmethylated ICR can be bound by CTCF. Presence of CTCF on the MA ICR directs enhancers to express long non coding RNA (lncRNA) H19. DNA methylation at the paternal allele (PA) ICR blocks CTCF binding, altering gene expression in the H19/Igf2 cluster. This DNA methylation spreads downstream into the H19 promoter, silencing it’s CpG island and reducing PA H19 expression. As CTCF is unable to bind the methylated ICR, enhancers activate expression of Igf2. </p><p>
</p><p>Methylation at ICRs hence have various modes of action. H19/Igf2 cluster ICR methylation causes Igf2 expression on the PA, while lack of methylation promotes H19 expression on the MA. In Wilm’s tumor, the maternal H19/Igf2 ICR switches to the paternal epigenetic state - loosing H19 and gaining Igf2 expression. High Igf2 leads to increased cell growth. Loss of imprinting, is common in cancer. Imprinting loss may disrupt homeostasis within the cell - leading to cancerous traits as increased cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation, addition of a methyl group
to cytosine, is a modification able to alter gene expression. Epigenetic
states are heritable, as semiconservative replication gives daughter-strand cytosine increased sensitivity to methylation. DNMT1
recognizes hemi-methylated strands, allowing daughter-strand cytosine
beside a parent-strand methylated cytosine to obtain maintain the epigenetic state.</p><p>Sensitive periods occur during epigenetic
reprogramming - at early embryonic development and primordial germ cell
development. Early embryonic cell
reprogramming is critical in determining somatic epigenetic state and DNA
methylation patterns. DNA methylation disruptions during
these periods cause lasting effects on the genetic expression.</p>

<p>In cancerous cells, DNA methylation is a tool
to alter cell functioning. Genes associated with
tumorigenesis (eg. tumor suppressor genes or DNA repair genes) are often
silenced through methylation at CpG sites, resulting in disrupted binding of
transcription factors and DNA-binding domains. DNA methylation allows the cell to obtain cancer cell characteristics. Reverting methylation (such as by using drugs) is hence a possibility
for treating cells with abnormal gene expression. During the sensitive
periods of DNA reprogramming, DNA is highly prone to disruptions, so it would
be inadvisable to administer DNA methylation drugs at this time. Changes during
these sensitive periods can last for the cell’s lifetime.</p></div>
