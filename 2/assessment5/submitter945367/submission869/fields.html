    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cell DNA methylation correspond to silencing of DNA. Usually CpG islands are not methylated but if they are it leads to silencing of the related region. Often CpG islands are methylated if they are involved in regulation of genes that in general should not be expressed.<br />In cancer cells DNA methylation is disrupted - usually it results in hypermethylation of CpG islands - those genes that are expressing in normal cells become methylated and silenced. If hypermethylation covers CpG islands in promotors of genes that are tumor supressors (e.g. RB or MGMT) - that could lead to cancer.<br /><br />Intergenic regions in normal cells are mostly methylated - that not allow transcription from weak promotors which could lead to transcriptional interference. In case of repetitive elements DNA methylation determine genome stability. Methylating repetitive elements prevent their transposition, does not allow ineligible recombination and avoiding transcriptional interference.<br />In cancer cells both intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypomethylated. That leads to decrease transcriptional stability as there will be more transcriptional interference. Also genomic stability in general as ineligible recombinations and element transposition could happen more often. If this kind of disruption will involve cancer inhibitor genes - silencing them or oncogenes - activating them - that could lead to cancer.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 mechanism involve 4 components - two regulated genes H19 and Igf2, enhancers that activate this genes and ICR that can bind CTCF region. In maternal allele ICR is unmethylated, it bind CTCF and enhancers cannot reach Igf2. Thus on maternal allele there is activation only of H19. in paternal allele ICR is methylated and CTCF cannot bind - it result in spreading methylation to H19 gene and enhancers can reach lgf2. Thus on paternal allele there is only expression of lgf2.<br />In Wilm's tumor there is disrupting of imprinting in H19/Igf2 mechanism. In this case DNA become hypermethylated and both copies - paternal and maternal become methylated. This result in overexpression of Igf2 gene and no expression of H19 gene. While Igf2 is growth promoting gene - this will consequence in tumor growth. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine belongs to the group of epigenecic drugs called DNA-demetilators. According to their name - they can decrease level of DNA methylation. That can be useful in curing cancer in cases if is mainly driven by DNA hypermethylation (such as in case of Wilm's tumor).</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable once methylation state is altered it will inherit and have long term effects on the epigenome.<br />There are few so called sensitive periods in human development - periods when epigenetic marks are resettled and there is epigenetic reprogramming of the organism. These are blastocyst stage of embryo development and stage when primordial germ cells are developed. In this periods organism is the most sensitive to external factors that can alter epigenetic states.<br />Thus if during sensitive periods drugs that affect epigenetic state are used that can result in unpredictable and more widespread changes in the epigenome than it supposed to.</div>
