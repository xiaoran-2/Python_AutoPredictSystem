    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belong to a class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA-demethylating agents, used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. </p><p>Some
tumours are driven by tumour suppressor
hypermethylation, then depletion of DNA methylation appears to suppres
tumorigenesis. Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltranferase. This drug is a chemical analogue of the cytosine  nucleoside present in DNA. In the body, decitabine is converted into decitabine  triphosphate, and then It  gets incorporate into the DNA upon replication. When the DNMT comes along to bind that nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, the DNMT is bound irreversibly and it cannot  longer be release. </p><p>By blocking DNMTs, decitabine will block the  division of tumour cells and lead to their death.The action of this DNMTi is replication dependent, then, because cancer cells are dividing much more rapidly of normal cells, they are replicating more and they will be more susceptible to the drug. </p><p> </p><p><br />       <br /></p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal
cell there is a hypomethylation of the CpG island and a hypermethylation of repetitive elements, the intergenic regions and the introns of genes.  In contrast, in
general, at cancer cells it occurs locus specific DNA hypermethylation at the CpG islands and CpG shores of tumor suppressor genes and ICRs  (loss of imprinting) while a genome-wide hypomethylation in repetitive regions, intergenic elements,  introns, CpG poor promoters and ICR (loss of imprinting).There is a swap in terms of where DNA methylation is found. </p><p></p><p>Different tumours have different dependencies or even both : it can be driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation or it can be driven by  chromosomal instability.  The contribution of DNA methylation to cancer is hypomethylation genome wide
(intergentic regions and repeats) giving to DNA instability and tumor suppressor hypermethylation, giving an abnormal cell growth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p><span></span><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is controlled by an  imprint control region (ICR). On a normal cell, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and it is unmethylated on the maternal allele. </p><p>DNA methylation at the ICR blocks binding of the insulator protein CTCF, which insulates <i>Igf2 </i>from downstream enhancers. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to <i>H19 </i>promoter to silence that gene and enhancers can access <i>Igf2 </i>to activate it, and therefore Igf2 is expressed and H19 is repressed. </p><p>On the maternal allele because the ICR is unmethylated, CTCF can bind to the ICR and then the downstream  enhancers will activate H19 but will silence Igf2, then we don`t find Igf2 expression.</p><span><span><span></span></span></span><p></p><p>
</p><p></p><p></p><span></span><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>However, on cancer cells we can find a loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster. On some type of cancer cells like in Wilm’s tumor, a particular childhood kidney tumor,  there is an hypermethylation of the ICR at the maternal allele. Then, there is also expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele, having now a double dose of Igf2 in comparasing with a normal cell. Due to Igf2 is growth promoting, an overexpression of this gene, causes an abnormal cell overgrowth like cancer.</p><p><br /></p><p><span><br /></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic marks, like DNA methylation, are mithotically heritable. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to the next cell generations, this is why epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells, but it is also the raison why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.<br /><br />In epigenomics, a sensitive period is when the environment is able to shape epigenetics and determine epigenetic phenotype or epìgenetic outcome. The periods that are sensitve to epigenetic control are those more sensitive to changes in the enviroment, when epigenetics marks are actively remodelling. There are two stages of development considered  sensitive periods; primordial germ cell development (all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperm) and pre-implantation  and early post-implantation period. <br /><br />Therefore, treating patients during those sensitive periods with epigenetic drugs would have several consequences on the whole organism. These drugs would change the epigenetic pattern of all  the cells, i.e. by hypomethylation, and due that those changes are mitotically heritable, it wolud cause epigenetic, even genetic, aberrations on all the cells of the organism. <br />  <div><div><br /><br /></div></div></div>
