    <div class="field-value">The normal state of DNA at CpG islands is to be unmethyated and allow cis gene expression, for example tumour suppressor genes when needed.<br />
In cancer cells the CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated especially at the sites that promote tumour suppressor genes. Which CpG sites become hypermethylated is cancer specific. There is an increase in CpG methylation with time in the case of a cancer, and also with aging. <br />
The hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer stops the expression of tumour suppressor genes. That is, a bad DNA mutation is not needed to stop the expression. This methylation is mitotically heritable so cancer cells proliferate, becoming more cancer cells that don’t die.<br />
DNA is methylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements to maintain gene stability; to stop wrong recombination between repeats; to stop activation of repeats; stop transposition; stop disruption of neighbouring genes (translocations). <br />
In cancer cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethelated by comparison with normal cells. This leads to gene instability; we may have deletions of genes; we may have insertions of genes; we may have reciprocal translocations where material is exchanged between nonhomologous chromosomes. Repeats may become active and replicate, inserting into other parts of the genome. This could lead to cell death but there is evidence from various studies that genomic instability leads to cancer. Another rarer example is intergenic regions that have a low density of CpG units in a promoter; here the loss of methylation results in the associated gene being activated that, for example, can result indirectly in tumour suppressor genes being deactivated. <br />
Both CpG hypermethylation and hypomethylation of the bulk of the genome can lead to cancer, which of the two is more important is cancer specific and may change over time for one cancer type.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Usually the insulator protein (CTCF) of the imprint control region in the gene of the paternal allele for IGF2 is methylated. This inactive CTCF region then cannot block the nearby enhancer of the IGF2 gene from activating that gene and so IGF2 is produced. This methylation spreads to the H19 gene and makes that inactive too in the paternal allele. <br />
Usually CTCF protein in the maternal allele is unmethylated. This active CTCF region blocks the nearby enhancer of the IGF2 gene from activating that gene and IGF2 is not produced. In this case H19 is active. <br />
Just one allele expressing the IGF2 gene makes the appropriate amount of IGF2. Similarly just one allele expressing H19 produces the right amount of its protein, an lncRNA.<br />
In people with Wilm’s tumour, the CTCF protein in the maternal allele is also methylated which then allows the enhancers to activate the IGF2 gene thereby producing IGF2.<br />
Now we have twice the amount of IGF2 being produced as is required for stable cell reproduction. IGF2 is a growth hormone which stimulates cell growth and proliferation more than should be, and that is cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine  is a DNA-demethylating agent, so belongs to DNMT inhibitors. It is a nucleoside analogue and becomes part of the DNA when the cell replicates.<br />
Decitabine hypomethylates DNA once incorporated into the genome by permanently binding DNA methyltransferase which would otherwise do the normal methylation.<br />
Decitabine works in cases where hypermethylation has stopped the expression of suppressor genes allowing unregulated cells proliferation. By removing this block tumour suppression can be activated. Because cancer cells otherwise have uncontrolled replication Decitabine rapidly allows then to be suppressed.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically hereditable and so can outlast the initial treatment that causes the change in methylation.<br />
A sensitive period for epigenetics in development is when environmental factors can influence epigenetic reprogramming; for example from fertilization to the formation of the epiblast, or from the formation of the primordial germ cells to the developed gametes. At these times epigenetic marks are being removed or set that last for the lifetime of somatic cells.<br />
The process of setting epigenetic marks in the sensitive periods is an interaction of many different actions, methylation or acetylation at multiple sites, histone modifications etc. At this point the big hammer of current treatment would not be discriminating in what it hit. Only when the epigenetic modifications are complete can we target an actual fault in the epigenetics
