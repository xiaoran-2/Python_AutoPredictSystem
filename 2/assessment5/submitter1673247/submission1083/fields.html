    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are G-C content rich interspersed DNA sequences, commonly associated with promoters forming sites of initiation. These are sites that, although are vital in bringing about various regulatory activities by virtue of their configurational characteristics, pose mutational hazards and are prone to deleterious mutational changes. <br />The CpG sequences dictate transcriptional activities by influencing chromatin structure. These sequences are generally non methylated. Silencing of the associated gene is brought about by bringing about heavy methylation at the CpGs by specific proteins, such as polycomb recruitment complex. <br />Carcinogenesis could be an outcome of misinterpreted/ unregulated/ aberrant epigenetic control. It could manifest as a result of global hypomethylation or specific hypermethylation at CpG sites. Hypermethylation may functionally repress the associated genes and this repressed state is maintained in multiple mitotic rounds as seen in cancer. On the other hand global hypomethylation largely affects satellite DNA, heterchromatic DNA repeats, etc.<br />The phenomenon of repeat-induced gene silencing,<span>related to the finding that mammalian DNA repeats tend to be highly methylated in postnatal somatic tissues. Hypomethylation has been very commonly associated with DNA repeats in various types of cancers. It may lead to a phenomenon known as repeat induced gene silencing. Endogenous retrotransposons is one of the examples of such a repeat sequences that have been implicated in cancer because these have their activities enhanced by their demethylation. Many studies have also pointed to the relation of cancer and demethylated LINE repeat sequences.<br /></span><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>The H19 is exclusively expressed by the maternal chromosome, whereas insulin like growth factor 2 (Igf-2) is paternally expressed. Their expression is parentally dependent and both the genes are controlled by a common set of regulatory elements. More specifically they use the same set of enhancers on different parental chromosomes. Thus these genes exhibit parent of origin monoallelic gene expression. The differentially methylated regions as seen in a large domain of the paternal chromosome is largely methylated and this specificity is maintained through all stages of development.<br /><br />An insulator element upstream of the maternal H19 silences the maternal Igf2, whereas epigenetic activity on the parental chromosome prevents this silencing activity. Disruption in the maintenance of this epigenetic state may lead to a cell state where Igf2 is over expressed. Such a state is seen when the maternal chromosome starts behaving like the paternal chromosome.</span>The methylated maternal ICR now prevents the binding of the insulator protein which otherwise was inhibiting Igf2 expression.<span> Such a progression in epigenetic abnormality is seen in Wilms tumour, a pediatric cancer of the kidneys.<br /></span><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decatibine is a cytosine nucleoside analogue and function as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, reactivate epigenetically silences tumour supressor genes and thus is a hypomethylating agent. It has been implicated in  therapeutic activity for conditions like myelodysplastic syndrome. <br />The repetitive mitotic rounds, seen in cancer, is very closely coupled with the activity of DNA methyltransferases.<br />Inhibition of DNA methyltransferases by Decitabine leads to the cell cycle exit.<br />Recent studies have shown that such tumour suppressing activity can be carried out to some extent independent of apoptotic signals. Thus Decatibine can carry out the required action, in specific concentrations, without triggering apoptosis. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic modifications is brought about at the genome in such a way that the change is stably maintained. This is a feature that has been exclusively extrapolated in the use of epigenetic drugs to bring about epigenetic changes in the DNA that lasts beyond the period of drug treatment. The sensitive periods constitute the period during which the epigenetic marks are completely erased and the cells are then subjected to a new round of epigenetic reprogramming. Establishment of new epigenetic marks is crucial to the development and is thus rendered as a sensitive period. Epigenetic reprogramming occurs during gametogenesis and embryonic stem cell development. <br />These are the cells that undergo continual differentiation in the context of proteins that bring about stable cell division and epigenetic marks establishment actions. If a drug, for instance, which is normally meant to inhibit DNA methyltransferases activity is administered during such a period, then inappropriate methylation would occur at wrong sites and at inadequate quantities. Large number of genes are under the control of epigenetic marks. Any discrepancies in such regulatory marks may  disrupt the normal expression of the associated genes.<br />Thus treating patients during sensitive periods is not advisable.</div>
