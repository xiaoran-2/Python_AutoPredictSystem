    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG islands of most genes are unmethylated.  Usually methylation of a promoter's CpG island means the gene is silenced.  The normal function of DNA methylation is to provide the gene silencing that is required for the development and differentiation of  the myriad of different cell types, from
the same DNA contained in every cell of our body, providing imprint control, and controling genes that should be ‘turned on or off’.  </p>

<p></p><p>

</p><p>In cancer the CpG islands of many genes, especially tumor suppressor genes, are usually methylated.   Since DNA methylation is mitoticaly
heritable, this is a very effective way to 'lock in' gene silencing of normally active genes.   Dr. Blewitt stated, CpG hypermythation “has been found in essentially
all tumors that have ever been
studied.”   </p>





<p>Silencing of tumor suppressor genes in a cell allows that cell to have a competitive advantage over other cells, because cancer cells are more likely to divide more rapidly and not die, eventually
taking over, resulting in tumorgenesis.   </p>



<p>The normal function
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and at repetitive elements is to
maintain gemonic stability and integrity, so we don't lose or gain chromosomal material (insertions
and deletions), or have illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes when
they should not occur.  </p>

<p>Normally recombination
only happens between regions that are genetic identical, i.e. between two
homologous chromosomes.  But repeats have large stretches of DNA that are identical,  and are similar to other repetitive regions in the genome.  In cancer these
repetitive elements, or intergenic regions, become hypomethylated, and 
chromosomes can missalign causing illegitimate recombinations.  
Hypomethylation can activate repeats enabling them to make a copies of 
themselves, and insert
themselves into other places in the genome which can disrupt  coding 
regions of genes.  Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters, which
are normally methylated, can also result in activation of genes which should 
be silenced. e.g. the
activation of the onco gene R-RAS  when it’s promoter
is hypomethylated, and activation of the
micaroRNA miR21 which targets the tumor suppressor PTEN.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">One of the common features of cancer cells is that they
display loss of imprinting, so genes that should be expressing mono-allelic
parent of origin, express either both parental alleles, or have both parental
alleles silenced.  Many of the genes that
are imprinted are involved in growth, and are either growth promoting or growth
suppressing.  <br /><br />The paternal <i>H19/Igf2
cluster</i>  imprint control region (ICR) is normally methylated.  
Because of the methylation at the ICR, CTCF is prevented from binding, 
and this allows enhancers to act on Igf2.<br /><br />The maternal <i>H19/Igf2
cluster</i> ICR is normally unmethylated, this allows CTCF
to bind to sights in the ICR which acts an insulator element that 
prevents Igf2 from accessing the shared enhancers, so the enhancers act 
on H19 rather than on Igf2.  As a result Igf2 is typically
silenced in the maternal allele.<p>In the case of Wilm’s
tumor, there is hypermethylation on the maternal allele at the control region
of the H19/Igf2 cluster<i>, </i>similar to the normal imprinted methylation
pattern on the paternal allele, and the hypermethylated maternal allele expresses Ifg2 just like the
paternal allele.  This results in a double
dose of Igf2 compared to a normal cell.  Igf2
is a growth promoting gene, and when over expressed, as in the case of Wilm’s
tumor, can result in cancer.</p><p><br /></p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal
mitotic cell division, when DNA is initially replicated, only the parent strand
maintains the methyl groups on CpG dinucleotides,  and the cytosines in daughter strand are
unmethylated.  DNMT1 is a DNA
methyltransferase enzyme that has a preference for hemi-methylated DNA.   DNMT1 binds to the hemi-methylated DNA and lays down methylation on the daughter strand restoring
the methlayted CpG dinucleotides, enabling mitotic heritability of DNA methylation.   <br /></p><p></p><p>

</p><p>Sensitive periods are periods during which
epigenetic reprogramming is occurring. 
If epigenetic reprogramming is disrupted during these periods it can
have significant impacts on the viability of cells undergoing epigenetic
reprogramming.</p>

<p>The sensitive periods of development are during primordial germ cell development, when somatic cell epigenetic marks must be removed and gamete specific epigenetic marks established, and in the pre-implantation period of early embryonic development, when the epigenetic marks specific to gamets must be removed and total potency restored so all of  the different cells types needed in an adult can develop.  </p>





<p>Treating patients who are developing germ cells (including those in the womb) with drugs
that that inhibit the epigenetic machinery could adversely affect the
genetic reprogramming occurring in their germ cells, causing loss of imprint
controls, and improper silencing or activation of genes.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylating agent used to treat myeloplastic syndromes,  a class of conditions where certain blood cells are dysfunctional, and for acute myeloid leukaemia  (AML).  Treatment with Decitabine causes DNMT I depletion and results in DNA hypomethylation.(1)   In cancers many normally active genes, such as tumor suppressor genes,  are silenced by the hypermethylation that occurs in cancer.  Treatment with a demethylating agent could target the aberrant cell DNA damage, immunity to cell death, and inappropriate silencing of genes caused by the hypermythelation normally found in cancer cells, and shrink tumors by restoring 
normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cell 
differentiation and proliferation.(2)<br /><br />1. <i>Decitabine</i>, Wikipedia<br />2. <i>Decitabine</i>, DrugBank<br /><br />This is the only place I have room to put this.  I had no prior knowledge of epigenetics and very little about genetics, so in reality essentially every word I have used answering these questions must be attributed to our marvelous instructor, Dr. Blewitt.<br /></div>
