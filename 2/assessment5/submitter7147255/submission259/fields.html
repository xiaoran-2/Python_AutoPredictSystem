    <div class="field-value">          DNA methylation at CPGs islands is the addition of a methyl group to the fifth carbon of cytosines that is followed by guanines in DNA. Normally, the CpGs island tend to be protected from methylation to avoid silencing of gene expression, meaning that if CpGs islands of a gene is methylated, this gene is inactivated. In genome, most of genes are unmethylated, only have some genes are methylated, for example, one X chromosome in female. Therefore, the methylation that occurs in wrong gene leads to abnormal situation, for example, cancer disease. There are an increase methylation in CpGs islands called Hypermethylation not only alters genetic mutation but also silence genes having function of preventing tumour from occurring. Time goes, DNA methylation is heritable and accumulated till the day enough to causes cancer because no more tumour suppressor genes. Hypermethylation could exist in single gene, sets of genes and even a region 2kb around CpGs islands called CpGs island shores.<br /><br />            Contrast with CpGs islands, in order to maintain completeness of genes, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. Methylation of intergenic regions helps genome to be stable, to avoid deletion, insertion and reciprocal translocation. Similarly, silencing to avoid transposition and illegitimate recombination that can lead to mutation in genome of repeat elements. In cancer, hypomethylation, situation in which methylation level is goes down, occurs in two regions, genomic integrity will be losed. The result is that repeat elements, is activated, can jump into other genes and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbor genes. Illegitimate recombination occurs, too.<br /><br />           To sum up, in cancer, hypermethylation in CpGs islands and hypomethylation goes on at the same time.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">      On maternal allele, imprinted control region is activated. Therefore, an insulator called CTCF can bind with imprinted control region on maternal. In this way, on maternal allele, CTCF will insulate IGf2 against enhancer bloking, leading to enhancers are free to cultivate H19 expression that is long noncoding RNA by looping chromosome at position of H19. By contrast, on paternal allele, imprinted control region is inactivated because of methylation, therefore, CTCF can not bind with, the result is enhancers are not free, they will enhance Igf2 expression. On the other hand, on paternal allele, methylation is not only in imprinted control region but also can be radiated to H19 promoter, silencing H19. To include, in normal cell, Igf2 is silenced on maternal allele and Igf2 expresses on paternal allele. But Igf2 expression occurs on both of paternal and maternal allele, causing Wilm's tumor. <br /><br />       When pattern imprinting is loss, silencing or activating gene occurs on both of paternal and maternal allele, leading to loss expression of growth restring genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. And if this change impact on gene promoter of oncogen, cancer will be happened.<br /><br />      </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decibatine is a form of DNA-demethylating agent. Methylation of DNA is a mechanism that impact on tumor suppressor genes. When there is an increase methylation in DNA, activity of tumor suppressor is blocked, no more factor regulates cell division, leading to growth of cell is uncontrolled, causing cancer. Decitabine reduces methylation, by this demethylation, function of tumor suppressor genes is restored, controlling growth of cell. With this mechanism, Decitabine has no effect on killing cell.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Thanks to DNMT1 enzyms and TET protein, DNA methylation can be mitotically heritable. DNMT1 creates hemi-methylated DNA then continue restoring methylation on both strands. TET protein is produced on certain time during developing of cell and its function is to activate dêmthylation. Two mechanism coordinate together ti maintain DNA methylation on the epigenome.</div>
