    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to contribute to genomic stability.  The islands are found at the promoter sites of genes and tend <b>not</b> to be methylated.  When methylated they function to silence gene expression.<br />By contrast, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated in cancer. The disruption occurs when these genes, particularly the tumor suppressor genes, are silenced, due to this hypermethylation.  Methylation in this area is associated with condensation of the chromatin, which is associated with gene silencing.  Methylated CpG is also bound by methylated CpG binding proteins which have a transcriptional repression domain, again, contributing to gene silencing.    <br />Unlike the CpG islands, under normal circumstances the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. As with CpG hypomethylation, this particular state contributes to overall genetic stability.  Contrast this with cancer, where the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated, a state that progresses with tumorigenicity.  The result is genetic instability, as with CpG island hypermethylation. <br />This instability in cancer, brought about by CpG island hypermethylation and intergenic region and repetitive element hypomethylation, results in genetic instability via normal gene disruption consisting of illegitimate combinations of and misalignments between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters with disruption to neighboring genes.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, in the Igf2 gene, the ICR is methylated on the paternal gene but not on the maternal gene.  Therefore, the maternal gene, due to its unmethylated state, it can be bound by CTCF, an insulator protein. This binding insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers, permitting them, via a loop mechanism, to act on H19 instead of Igf2, enhancing  expression of H19 and silencing Igf2.<br />In the paternal gene the ICR is methylated in the normal state.  CTCF, therefore, cannot not bind,, there is no insulator action, and the downstream enhancers are then free to act on Igf2, promoting its expression from the paternal gene. H19 is not expressed.<br />In Wilm's tumor, there is a hypermethylation of the maternal ICR, prohibiting CTCF binding and insulation.  The enhancers, therefore, rather than acting on H19, are free to act on Igf2, enhancing its expression, which is usually silent in the maternal allele. In this scenario, there is a double dose of Igf2.  Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can result in a loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is mitotically heritable. Decitabine is an antineoplastic drug that belongs to the class of demethylation agents.  The drug converts to decitabine triphosphate, which is directly incorporated into DNA and inhibits DNA methytransferase.  The result is DNA hypomethylation.  Cancer is marked by aberrant DNA methylation patterns.  This aberrant methylation causes an array of tumor suppressor genes to undergo hypermethylaton and become transcriptionally silent.  By preventing DNA hypermethylaton in these areas, dacitabine permits the tumor suppressor genes to resume their normal activity.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There are two sensitive periods in mammals, one at primordial germ cell development and the other at early embryonic development. It is during these times that epigenetic reprogramming occurs--existing epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation, are cleared and others laid down. DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark, i.e., it is mitotically heritable.  Due to this heritability, alterations in methylation can be passed down during cell division to the daughter cells throughout the life of the organism.  If a patient is treated during one of the sensitive periods, it can interfere with the normal manner in which the DNA methylation marks are cleared or laid down--marks may not be cleared, or they may be laid down inappropriately.  This opens the possibility for genetic instability that remains throughout the life of the organism.. </div>
