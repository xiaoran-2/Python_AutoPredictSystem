    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CPG islands is to silence gene expression most likely by allowing chromatin proteins to attach and form heterochromatin, a more densely packed form of DNA.  In cancer CpG islands ten to be hypermethylated in tumour suppressor genes and hypomethylated in oncogenes. So tumour suppressor genes which "suppress" over production of certain proteins are silenced, allowing overproduction. Oncogenes are allowed to be expressed more.<br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements (transposons) stop them being transcribed, allowing stability of the genome. In cancer, there tends to be hypomethylation both of CpG Islands and histones, allowing transcription of these transposons and therefore less stability.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is methylated. CTFC cannot bind to it, so the downstream enhancers can act on Igf2 to allow its expression.<br />The maternal allele is not methylated, so CTFC can bind to it. The Igf2 is insulated from the downstream enhancers which then act on H19.<br />In Wilm's tumour, either because of paternal uniparental disomy or mutation to cause loss of imprinting or disruption of imprinting the affected person has two paternally imprinted Imprint Control Clusters of Igf2/H19. The Cdkn1c gene, a tumour suppressor is silenced and the Igf2, an oncogene is expressed. This allows wild overgrowth of the cells to cause Wilm's tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA de-methylating agent. <br />It acts<span> by inhibiting </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methyltransferase">DNA methyltransferase</a><span>. It is a chemical analogue of cytidine, a nucleoside present in DNA and RNA. Cells in the presence of Decitabine incorporate it into DNA during replication and RNA during transcription. The incorporation of Decitabine into DNA or RNA inhibits an enzyme called methyltransferase thereby causing de-methylation in that sequence. This adversely affects the way that cell regulatory proteins are able to bind to the DNA/RNA substrate (<a href="http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01262">http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01262</a>).<br />If the DNA becomes un-methylated then this allows the gene to be expressed. If it is an "Oncogene" then growth will begin to become un-controlled and form a cancer. <br />Decitabine has an anit-tumour effect by causing the cell-regulating genes to regain control of rapidly-dividing cancer cells.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation may have a long-lasting effect since the epigenetic changes can be passed down to daughter and granddaughter cells.<br />A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are removed from the DNA and then the DNA is re-programmed with epigenetic marks. This occurs in germ cells when sperm and eggs are made and also in the developing embryo before implantation. Any treatment with drugs that alter methylation or de-methylation or acetylation during sensitive periods may cause damage that is more severe than if given during other times</div>
