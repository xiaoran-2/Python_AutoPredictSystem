    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer global hypomethylation and hypermethylation at CpG islands occurs leading to activation of tumour oncogenes and inactivation of  tumour suppressor genes. CpG islands are often found at promoter region of genes and are usually unmethylated. Methylation of CpG islands located at promoter regions leads to silencing of expression of that particular gene. Methylation of CpG dinucleotides causes binding of MeCp1 and MeCp2 proteins which cause repression of transcription and can recruit other factors to the region that condense chromatin and reduce access to transcription factors. Also, CpG methylation may directly prevent binding of transcription factors to the promoter region of the affected gene. In cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of tumour suppressor genes leads to silencing of these genes. Tumour suppressor gene products keep tumour formation in check by removing small tumours rapidly from the system. Loss of function of tumour suppressor genes leads to unhindered growth of tumours leading to cancer.</p><p>Under normal conditions, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. Methylation of intergenic regions helps maintain genomic integrity by preventing illegitimate mutations such as deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions and also by silencing cryptic transcriptions start sites and cryptic splice sites. Methylation of repetitive elements helps maintain genomic stability by heterochromatinisation, by silencing the repeats and increasing conversion of meC to T to prevent transposition, preventing illegitimate recombination and avoiding transcriptional interference from strong promoters. In cancers, genome wide hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements occurs. This causes an open chromatin structure that causes genomic instability by allowing illegitimate recombination, transposition and mutations such insertions, reciprocal translocations, deletions, inversions which may lead to malignant transformation. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions also relieves repression of cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites. Genomic instability leads to malignant transformation.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value"><p>In Wilm's tumour, hypermethylation of ICR of the maternal allele at the H19/IgF2 cluster  causes overexpression of IgF2, a growth promoting gene, leading to cancer. In a normal cell the ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated, causing CTCF binding to the insulator element which allows the downstream enhancers to act on the promoter of H19 gene and cause expression of H19. This blocks the access of enhancers to IgF2 and hence it's expression is silenced. In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated which prevents CTCF binding. Also the promoter of H19 is methylated. Hence H19 is inaccessible to the enhancers and they are able to access the promoter of IgF2 allowing IgF2 expression and silencing of H19. In Wilm's tumour, hypermethylation of the ICR of the maternal allele occurs. This blocks CTCF binding and hence the downstream enhancers no longer have access to H19, silencing it's expression. The enhancers gain access to the promoter of IgF2 instead and cause IgF2 expression. Hence, in Wilm's tumour, both the maternal and paternal alleles express IgF2. This overexpression of the IgF2 gene product, which is a growth factor, causes abnormal and excessive growth of kidney tissue and causes cancer.(lecture slides)</p></div>

    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>

        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor used to treat MDS that has progressed to AML. It is a nucleoside analogue which gets incorporated into DNA and binds DNMT1 irreversibly, preventing methylation of daughter strands during replication. MDS leading to AML is caused by CpG island hypermethylation of the promoter region of tumour suppressor genes. Hypermethylationin the promoter region  causes silencing of these genes by binding of MeCP1 and MeCP2 which prevent transcription via their transcriptional repression domain and also by blocking transcription factors from accessing DNA by recruiting chromatin condensing factors. CpG hypermethylation may also prevent binding or transcription factors to the promoter region. Decitabine treatment leads to gradual loss of CpG island hypermethylation of the promoter region of tumour suppressor genes, relieving the repression on expression of these genes. Tumour suppressor gene product starts removing tumours from the system, leading to gradual decrease of tumour burden.(lecture slides)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and is facilitated by DNMTs. Blocking methylation of daughter strands during replication leads to gradual decline in methylation and finally, total removal of methylation. During replication, DNMT1 specifically recognizes hemimethylated DNA, binds to it and methylates the daughter strand. Removal of methylation prevents formation of hemimethylated DNA, preventing further methylation even in the presence of DNMT1.  DNA methylation is removed from the genome during two sensitive periods of development - primordial germ cell(PGC) development and early embryonic development - and then reset afterwards to maintain the normal formation, development and function of the various tissues of the body. Demethylation of paternal and maternal genome and imprinted genes occurs during PGC development followed by resetting of germ cell specific methylation. Demethylation of paternal and maternal genome occurs during early development to ensure totipotency of early embryonic cells followed by setting of lineage specific methylation marks post-implantation. Minimal demethylation of IAPs followed by rapid methylation occurs during both periods to maintain heterochromatinisation. During these periods, the genome is vulnerable and treating patients with methylation altering drugs would lead to an abnormal methylation pattern that might affect the normal formation, development, differentiation and functioning of germ cells and tissues.(lecture slides)</div>
