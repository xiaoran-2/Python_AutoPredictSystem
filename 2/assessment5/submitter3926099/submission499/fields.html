    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the frequent modifications of
the DNA is methylation of the cytosine bases at the C5 position. This
modification usually decreases gene expression. One notable exception are the
CpG islands that are unmethylated regardless of the expression status of the underlying
gene. However, in cancer some CpG islands can become hypermethylated which brings
about silencing of the corresponding gene. This is especially problematic if
the hypermethylated CpG islands control tumor suppressor genes that prevent
uncontrolled proliferation of the cells. On the other hand, DNA methylation in
intergenic regions and at repetitive elements may inhibit transcriptional noise
and prevent illegitimate recombination by maintaining chromatin in compacted
state, inaccessible to the enzymatic machinery. But in cancer such regions
frequently become hypomethylated, resulting in aberrant transcription, inappropriate gene activation, and
frequent chromosomal rearrangements (i.e. genomic instability), one of the hallmark of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><i>H19/Igf2</i><span> cluster
is an example of an imprinted genomic region. The paternal allele has methylated
intergenic region between genes <i>H19</i>
and <i>Igf2</i>, as well as the 5’-end of
the <i>H19</i> gene. This represses the transcription
of the <i>H19</i> gene and prevents binding
of the insulator protein CTCF to the intergenic region. Consequently, enhancer
elements downstream of the <i>H19</i> gene
are free to activate the transcription of the <i>Igf2</i> gene. Contrary, the maternal allele is not methylated and
therefore the <i>H19</i> gene is expressed
and the CTCF is free to bind to the intergenic region, preventing enhancers to
activate transcription of the <i>Igf2</i>
gene. In Wilm’s tumor hypermethylation of the imprint control region of this
locus results in overexpression of the <i>Igf2</i>
gene and silencing of the <i>H19</i> gene as
we effectively have two paternal alleles. Although the exact role of the <i>H19</i> in cell is not known, it appears to
have consequences for the genome stability (ref: PMID 23047867). The
overexpression of the <i>Igf2</i> gene
results in the overgrowth phenotype (ref: PMID 23047867).</span><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that inhibits DNA
methyltransferase by covalently binding it when incorporated into the DNA.
This results in DNA damage and the hypomethylation of the genome, which is citotoxic
for the rapidly dividing tumor cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can change
expression of some oncogens or tumor suppressors and therefore change
susceptibility to some standard chemotherapeutics. Another possibility is inducing
changes in the long range epigenetic alterations which would affect nuclear and
chromation organisation. However, such therapeutics may also impact non-cancerous
cells and change their epigenetic signatures which would affect homeostasis of
the healthy cells, as well as the next generation in the case of the germ cells.
Therefore, they should not be administered during the sensitive periods of primordial
germ cell development, gametogenesis in general (if the patient wishes to reproduce)
or in the (early) pregnancy.</p></div>
