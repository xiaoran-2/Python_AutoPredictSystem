    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpG
islands are usually unmethylated in a normal cell, as these are most often
found in promoter regions and are a mitotically heritable epigenetic
modification, due to the hemi-methylated preference of DNMT1. DNA methylation
is synonymous with gene silencing. On the other hand, in intergenic
regions and repetitive elements, which are required to be packaged into a more
heterochromatin structure to maintain genomic stability, they are usually found
to be hypermethylated. In cancer, the reciprocal is true; CpG islands are
heavily methylated, as well as their “CpG Shores”, and intergenic and
repetitive regions are hypomethylated. If a CpG island is a promoter of a tumor
suppressor, and it is hypomethylated, then this will result in an increase of
cancer. Also, if the promoter is for a gene which activates an oncogene (eg.
codes for a transcription factor, piRNA) then this will further increase
cancer. Thus the methylation is context specific. Hypomethylation of intergenic
regions and repetitive elements results in a more euchromatin structure and hense
“loose” DNA can “pair-up” with similar regions on neighboring chromosomes. This
can lead to illegitimate recombination, activation of cryptic promoters,
activation of repeats and transposition etc… therefore increasing genomic
instability. In addition to this, CpG-poor regions are usually hypomethylated,
therefore resulting in gene activation. For example the R-RAS oncogene and
microRNA Mir21 are under regulation of CpG-poor regions, and Mir21 targets
PTEN, which is a tumor suppressor. Thus increased activation of Mir21 results
in decreased tumor suppression.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The "dose dependant" mechanism of X-inactivation equalises the expression of the X-linked genes in females. In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternally inherited X chromosome is hypermethylated in the H19 region. This forms a tightly wound heterochromatin structure, whereas the maternally inherited X chromosome is not methylated at this site. This results in a different transcription pattern of these two chromosomes. Firstly, the paternal Igf2 gene is expressed, due to methylation at H19, disrupting the primary enhancer activity downstream of the cluster and disallowing the insulator protein CTCF binding to the ICR. One the other hand, the maternal cluster allows enhancing of the H19 gene by CTCF binding and preventing Igf2 expression. Loss of imprinting results in aberrant expression of the cluster and twice the amount of Igf2 expression. This is due to methylation at the H19 site on both chromosomes, therefore enhancing the Igf2 gene both times and increasing cellular growth, which may lead to the Wilm's tumour. Since Igf2 is a cellular growth gene, over expression of this gene will predispose a cell to evade growth suppression, one of the hallmarks of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a hypomethylating drug, which inhibits DNMT by irreversibly binding to the DNMT active site, and therefore decreases DNA methylation. In cancers, generally there is global DNA hypomethylation and hypermethylation at CpG Islands. Decitabine is used to treat myelodyplastic syndrome, and since each cancer type has a different methylation state, it may be that decitabine somehow affects the CpG Islands very effectively to reduce their deleterious effects on the cell, however, it is still not clear why it only affects myelodyplastic syndrome. Moreover, since <span>decitabine targets DNMT, which is devision dependant, then it preferentially will target cancer cells, since they divide more rapidly than healthy cells.</span><br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks need to be mitotically heritable i.e. be transferred from mother to daughter cell after mitosis, thus maintain the cell type. Therefore cells and the epigenetic machinery are programmed to maintain the epigenome of dividing cells. DNMT1 has a preference to hemi-methylated DNA, and targets it for methylation on both strands, which prolongs this epigenetic make-up of the cell line. Altering the methylation state of the cell will therefore be passed on to daughter cells, since these epigenetic marks are sustained. It must be kept in mind that with drugs which have been approved, their mechanism of action is not fully understood, therefore any side effects and undesired alterations to the epigenome will be passed onto daughter cells. This is particularly important in sensitive periods of low DNA methylation; the reprogramming which takes place at fertilisation and primordial germ cell development. As a precaution it is therefore advisable to not administer these drugs during these times i.e. a pregnant female or a young individual which may still have developing germ cells. These sensitive periods will be more susceptible to undesirable alterations and may have harmful effects.</div>
