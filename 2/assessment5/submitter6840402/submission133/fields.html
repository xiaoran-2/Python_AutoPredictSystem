    <div class="field-value">There is genome-wide disruption of DNA methylation in cancer. Overall there is a reduction in methylation (hypomethylation) within the genome of cancer cells, although some areas experience an increase in methylation (hypermethylation).<br />In normal cells, CpG islands, which are frequently associated with promoter regions of genes, are generally unmethylated. Methylation of CpG islands silences the promoters and hence prevents expression of the associated gene.<br />In cancer cells, hypermethylation of CpG islands results in silencing of the associated gene. Often tumour suppressor genes, which are important in DNA repair and organised cell death (apoptosis), are affected which leads to loss of some of the body's defence mechanisms against aberrant cell growth. This contributes to cancer development and continued growth.<br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements enhances chromosomal stability by preventing recombination and transposition of genomic elements and restricting activation of cryptic promoters.<br />In cancer cells there is general hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This leads to instability of the genome and an increased number of illegitimate recombinations, transpositions, insertions and deletions. These disruptions to the DNA sequence can be a significant contributing factor in the development of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting is a process in which alleles of certain genes are silenced according to their parent-of-origin. As the genes involved are often associated with growth and development, disruption of imprinted genes can contribute to cancer development and growth.<br />Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) is an imprinted gene on human chromosome 11. On the paternal allele, the imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated. When this area is methylated and inactive, the downstream enhancer region will cause expression of Igf2. In contrast, on the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and will bind to CTCF, an insulator protein. This protein blocks the action of the enhancers on the Igf2 gene and Igf2 will not be expressed.<br />In the case of Wilm's tumour, a childhood cancer of the kidneys, the ICR in the H19/Igf2 cluster at both alleles is methylated, so both will resemble the paternal allele. As a result, Igf2 will be expressed by both alleles and will be present in increased amounts - a 'double dose'.<br />As Igf2 is a growth promoter it can act as an oncogene. The abnormally high expression will contribute to the development of cancer.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an epigenomic modifier that is registered for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes.<br />It is classed as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). The agent is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into the host cell DNA during replication. It will bind DNMT but not release it, preventing the enzyme from methylating regions of the genome. The end result is genomic hypomethylation.<br />By preventing the methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions, it allows increased expression of tumour suppressor genes. In haematological cancers, the silencing of tumour suppressor genes by DNA methylation is associated with more severe disease, so reversing this epigenetic change can result in an anti-tumour effect. As it can only act on replicating cells, it tends to target cancer cells and spare normal cells which generally have lower rates of cell division.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dr Stephen Baylin noticed that some epigenetic drugs seemed to affect the way a tumour responded to chemotherapy long after the drug was stopped.<br />This is not surprising given that epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, the target of several anti-cancer therapies, are mitotically heritable. This means that, once established, the DNA methylation pattern is maintained during cell division and a daughter cell will carry the same methylation marks as its parent cell. The effects of a DNA methylation-altering anti-cancer drug can therefore persist beyond the treatment period.<br />As some stages during the life cycle, the epigenome is actively reprogrammed. This involves removal of epigenetic marks and is followed by their re-establishment. The two main periods during which this occurs are at primordial germ cell and early embryonic (pre-implantation) development. These stages are described as 'sensitive periods' and are times when outside factors can have a significant impact on the epigenome.<br />Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods is likely to risk significant side effects as the action of these medications will be enhanced during epigenetic reprogramming and may have undesirable consequences. These changes may affect the children of patients and, potentially, grandchildren and future generations.<br /></div>
