    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are hypomethylated and the tumor suppressor gene is active in a normal cell.<br />DNA hypermethylation at the CpG promoter silences tumor supressor genes in cancer. Genome wide DNA hypomethylation is also an abnormality found in cancer. DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hyper) can result in loss of growth restricting genes and can cause overexpression of growth promoting genes.<br />Intergenic region and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in normal cell. Intergenic region and repetitive elements maintains genomic integrity in normal cell. In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repeats are hypomethylated.This causes genomic instability/ chromosome instability (reciprocal translocations, insertions and deletions)<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprint control region (ICR) is hypermethylated in paternal allele. This blocks CTCF from binding to the ICR. The enhancers then act on Igf2 which is expressed. ICR is unmethylated in maternal allele and allows CTCF to bind to the ICR. This allows enhancers to act on H19 and it is expressed but Igf2 is silenced. In Wilm's tumour, both maternal and paternal alleles are hypermethylated. CTCF cannot bind to ICR and enhancers act on Igf2 on both maternal and paternal alleles and this causes double dose of Igf2 which causes the tumour.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is DNA demethylating agent (DNMTi) belongs to class of DNMT inhibitors. Deitabine is a nucleoside analog and binds to DNA during replication. It is division dependent and when DNMT1 comes to bind to it they are irreversibly bound and this is passed on to the daughter cells. Since cancer cells go through replication faster than the normal cells, they are affected more and have decitabine has an anti- tumour effect.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark and when there is a change in an epigenetic mark, they can be passed on to the daughter cells and granddaughter cells during cell division until they are actively erased. Once erased, they don't return. Sensitive periods are when altered environment has an effect on epigenetic control. Primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation and early post-implantation and sensitive periods. These periods are most sensitive to changes in the environment. All cells are exposed to the drug used in treatment and can  cause change in the environment, which can be a huge assault if it is during sensitive period e.g. younger patients with developing germ cell going through treatment can have germ cells affected by the drug.<br /></div>
