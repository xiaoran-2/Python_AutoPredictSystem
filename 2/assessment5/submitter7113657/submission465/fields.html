    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal process of DNA methylation at CpG
islands is usually unmethylated. Many genes in mammalian genomes
have CpG islands associated with the start of the gene (promoter regions). These
regions are normally unmethylated to allow the genic expression and if they are
methylated the gene expression would be repressed (CpG islands tend to be
protected from methylation). When a CpG island is methylated, it is associated
with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure that represses the gene
expression.</p>

<p>In cancer, the CpG islands are more
likely to be methylated. DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation
to silence tumor suppressor genes in cancer. If you inhibit tumor suppressors
and activate oncogenes you propitiate cancer. Epimutations such as CpG islands
methylation are mitotically heritable. For this reason epimutations can be
selected because they are more likely to divide rapidly or not die as much. However,
epimutations are reversible. Tumor suppressor hypermethylation is more frequent
than mutations in cancer but varies by tumor type. In summary, DNA methylation
in CpG islands allows the repression of tumor suppressor genes that contribute
to cancer.</p>

<p> The normal function of DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and in repetitive elements are for maintain
the stability of the genome. DNA methylation in intergenic regions allows the
maintenance of genomic integrity by silencing cryptic transcription start sites
and cryptic splice sites. DNA methylation in repetitive elements maintains the
genomic integrity by silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, avoiding
transcriptional interference and preventing illegitimate recombination.</p>

<p><span>In cancer, intergenic regions and
repetitive elements are hypomethylated leading to genomic instability. This
instability causes illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of
repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to
neighboring genes. The depletion of DNA methylation in these regions trigger
genome and chromosome instability and this enhances tumorgenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele methylation pattern in a
normal cell is based on the H19 gene promoter methylation that inhibits the
expression of H19. Paternal methylation at the ICR prevents CTCF
(Transcriptional repressor) binding and together with H19 gene promoter methylation
(No expression of H19) allows the enhancers to access Igf2. Therefore, there is
expression of Igf2.</p>

<p>The maternal allele methylation pattern in a
normal cell is based on the H19 gene promoter unmethylation. In this allele,
the H19 ICR remains unmethylated allowing CTCF and its cofactors to bind. This
interaction mediates enhancer blocking allowing downstream enhancers to access
the H19 promoter. Therefore, there is no expression of Igf2.</p>

<p>In Wilm’s tumor, both alleles (paternal and
maternal) are methylated. For this reason, there is an inhibition of CTCF
binding and no expression of H19 causing overexpression of Igf2.</p>

<p>If there is a disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster, <span>it is possible that
both alleles are methylated causing an overexpression of Igf2. Igf2 is a growth
factor that is involved in gestation and could cause disorders such as
different types of cancer e.g. ovarian cancer and islet cell tumors. A
disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can contribute to propitiate
cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitiabine belongs to the class of epigenetic
inhibitors called DNMT1i. Decitabine is composed of nucleoside analogues that
irreversibly bind to DMNTs after they are incorporate into DNA. It is a
replication dependent drug that inhibits addition of methyl groups into DNA. By
adding methyl groups into some gene promoters, DNMT1 mechanism could increase
the methylation and decrease the gene expression. This could cause the
repression of some genes like tumor suppressor genes. </p>

<p><span>By using DNMT1i like Decitabine, the addition
of methyl groups to the DNA would be blocked and this could avoid the
inhibition of the expression of some genes that are involved in the regulation
of the cell cycle. This drug can achieve slow the rate of cell division by
allowing expression of tumor suppressor genes, improving anti-neoplasic
effects. However, in low doses DNMT1 has major effects that in higher dose because
DNMTi are toxic in higher doses.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The reason why altering DNA methylation can
have enduring effects on the epigenome is that the epigenetic changes are
mitotically heritable. This means that when a methylation is added or removed
the next generations would have this methylation if it is added or not if it is
removed.</p>

<p>A sensitive period is a specific term of time in
which epigenome is sensitive to changes and modifications such as
environmental, chemical or endogenous. Throughout development, the sensitive
periods are in the early stages, in the PGCs development and in some cell types
upon differentiation. These periods are sensitive because in these stages, a
lot of events are occurring within the epigenetic reprogramming, thereby,
epigenome is sensitive to suffer modifications that can produce epigenome alterations
and it may cause genome instability, CpG islands methylation, etc.</p>

<p><span>Treating patients during sensitive periods
would be inadvisable because the epigenetic modifications are mitotically
hereditable. This means that if there are changes in the epigenome in these
periods, these changes would be inherited by the next generation cells. These
alterations could cause disruption of gene expression by enhancing or repressing
their expression and involve long-term consequences which would affect the
health of the patient and next generations.</span></p></div>
