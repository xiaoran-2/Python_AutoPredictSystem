    <div class="field-value"><p>Genes
are strands of material that essentially transmit information to
create the phenotype of the organism. The more open and exposed these
strands are, the more effect they have. Methylation essentially wraps
up genes, causing them to express less of their information. "CpG" is
DNA in which a cytosine nucleotide is next to a guanine nucleotide
in a linear sequence of bases, and is separated by one
phosphate (Cytosine+phosphate+Guanine=CpG). Most of the genes
responsible for phenotype expression are found in clusters called CpG
islands. Methylation is an essential part of gene activity by
reducing the effect of genes that are not needed, such as the unused
gene in an allele.</p>
<p>In cancer, genes at CpG islands can be
hypermethylated, meaning they are so tightly wrapped up they are
completely silenced. This process causes necessary information not to
be transmitted, such as the information to tell a cell to stop
growing. Cancer can also cause hypomethylation, or not methylated when they should be, causing gene information that should not have been expressed to express.<br /></p>
<p>Between the CpG islands are stretches
of DNA sequences called intergentic regions, or IGR. These IGRs
contain a lot of repetitive information, and much of it is ordinarily
methylated. Cancer typically causes hypomethylation in IGRs causing
this information to be expressed. This is particularly disruptive as
DNA goes through a process of recombining while replicating, and the
expression of these repetitive elements confuses the process leading
to DNA damage.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19 gene essentially prevents the IGF2 gene from expressing. In a process called imprinting, the
paternal allele of the H19 gene is ordinarily always fully
methylated, resulting in no expression. This hypermethylation of the
H19 paternal allele allows for the expression of the paternal allele
of the IGF2 gene. Conversely,  the maternal allele of the H19 gene is
ordinarily always unmethylated resulting in no expression of the
maternal allele of the IGF2 gene. 
</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, the maternal H19
allele is also hypermethylated. This results in the maternal IGF2
allele expressing itself.<br /></p>
<p>When the imprinting at the H19/Igf2
cluster is disrupted, it results in both the paternal and maternal
IGF2 alleles expressing themselves.  This leads to an overgrowth of
the cell resulting in a tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA
hypomethylating agent. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase, or the
process that causes methylation. As hypermethylation can cause cells
to grow out of control in cancer, Decitabine helps to prevent genes
from being incorrectly hypermethylated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is passed on as the
cell divides and replicates. Once methylation is deactivated,
daughter cells formed in the replication process of mitosis will not
re-methylate. Therefore, stopping the incorrect hypermethylation will
result in the new cells not having the cancerous properties,
essentially isolating the cancer to the existing cells and stopping
it from spreading. 
</p>
<p>Since drugs that affect the epigenetic
process spread throughout the entire system, it is important not to
use them on patients in sensitive periods. A sensitive period would
include in younger patients when they are developing germ cells.
These drugs essentially switch off the epigenetic process that is
essential for early development, and employing these drugs during the
development of germ cells might cause disruption of the critical
epigenetic processes of their later embryos.  <br /></p></div>
