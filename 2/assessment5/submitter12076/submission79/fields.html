    <h1>Submission 79 from Anon (session_user_id: 586b485b3523ec0b178f4420bb828f181bf0d6c3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyl transferase inhibitors.</div><div>When Decitabine is present in a cell that divides it gets incorporated</div><div>into the DNA during the replication process.  Once it is attached to</div><div>the DNA and a DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) comes along, the DNMT will</div><div>bind to Decitabine and then will no longer be able to methylate other</div><div>sites in the DNA.  It is known that certain tumors are strongly linked</div><div>to CpG island hypermethylation, so Decitabine's effect of reducing the overall <br />methylation (by disabling the DNMTs that methylate DNA) will reduce CpG island<br />hypermethylation and thus can have an anti-tumor effect.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The purpose of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene</div><div>expression.  The methylation at a cytosine is established by</div><div>methyltransferase proteins DNMT3a/b and is mitotically heritable </div><div>because during DNA replication another methyltransferase, DNMT1, </div><div>copies the methyl group from the parent strand to the daughter strand.</div><div>The CpG islands are usually found at the promoter regions of genes and</div><div>when they are methylated, CpG binding proteins (MeCP1 and MeCP2)</div><div>can bind and prevent transcription thus silencing this gene.  In normal</div><div>cells very few CpG islands are methylated while in cancer we find</div><div>hypermethylation of various CpG islands.  If the CpG region happens </div><div>to be at the promoter region of a tumor suppressor gene the hypermethylation <br />will cause the tumor suppressor gene to be silenced  and hence the cell <br />can grow into a tumor.</div><div><br /></div><div>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated in</div><div>normal cells for two main reasons: maintaining genomic integrity and</div><div>avoiding transcriptional interference.  Both intergenic regions and</div><div>repetitive elements contain LTR's which are very strong promoters for</div><div>proteins gag and pol.  Gag and pol facilitate copy and pasting (and cut</div><div>and pasting) within the DNA leading to a variety of genomic mutations. So</div><div>silencing them by methylating their LTR promoters is good for maintaining</div><div>genomic integrity.  Furthermore, intergenic regions and repetitive</div><div>elements contain cryptic promoters which go in the opposite direction</div><div>of regular promoters and therefore may interfere with promoters going in</div><div>the normal direction. Silencing these cryptic promoters via methylation</div><div>thus avoids transcriptional interference.  In cancer the intergenic</div><div>regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated.  The loss of <br />methylation means a reduction in silencing, in particular for the LTR's,</div><div>so gag and pol proteins will be expressed and will cause genomic</div><div>instabilities, i.e. mutations in the DNA that then lead to cancer.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>On the paternal allele the imprint control region (ICR), which consists</div><div>of a CTCF binding site and the H19 gene, is methylated.  The methylation</div><div>prevents CTCF, which would act as an insulator, from binding.  Without</div><div>this insulator downstream transcription enhancers can act on the Igf2</div><div>gene (which is upstream from the imprint control region) and Igf2</div><div>is expressed.  One the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated so CTCF</div><div>can bind and act as an insulator.  The insulation prevents the enhancers</div><div>from acting on Igf2, so Igf2 will not be expressed from the maternal</div><div>allele. </div><div><br /></div><div>In Wilm's tumor, however, the ICR of the maternal allele is methylated</div><div>as well so Igf2 will be expressed from the maternal allele as well</div><div>leading to an overexpression of Igf2.  Since Igf2 is a growth promoting</div><div>protein its overexpression can contribute to uncontrolled cell growth,</div><div>i.e. cancer.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation changes which genes are expressed.  Broadly speaking,</div><div>higher levels of methylation on the histone tails of a particular gene</div><div>have a silencing effect so that the DNA for this gene can no longer</div><div>be transcribed to RNA.  A sensitive period is a time where an altered</div><div>environment can have an effect on the methylation state of the DNA and</div><div>therefore can change the epigenetic control of gene expressions.</div><div>Sensitive periods in the development of mammals include the pre- and</div><div>early postimplantation of the embryo as well as the primordial germ</div><div>cell development within the embryo.  These time periods are sensitive</div><div>because during this time the cells in the embryo undergo an active</div><div>remodeling of their epigenome.  Treating pregnant women during sensitive</div><div>(for the embryo) periods is inadvisable because drugs that can alter</div><div>for example methylation patterns can disrupt the normal epigenetic</div><div>control of the embryo.</div></div>
