    <div class="field-value">In a normally-functioning cell, DNA methylation at CpG islands will silence the expression of corresponding genes. In cancer, CpG islands tend to be hyper-(or over) methylated, and this hypermethylation increases with time. It is possible that disruption in histone modifications or other epigenetic processes (sometimes caused by mutations in epigenetic machinery, such as various enzymes) contribute to this over-methylation. Because hypermethylation usually leads to the suppression of a gene, it is likely that the genes these CpG islands regulate are somehow connected with tumor suppression, so if they were being expressed correctly, it would be less likely to get cancer. <br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normally-functioning DNA are usually methylated, or "turned off." However, genome wide, we find decreasing methylation of these areas in cancer. If these regions are not suppressed, it can lead to chromosomal abnormalities, such as deletions, insertions, or deleterious recombinations. Repetitive areas, in particular, when active are relatively prone to copy themselves, with the copy ending up in areas of the genome where they should not be. In addition, sometimes when these areas are expressed, they may in turn activate neighbor genes that should not be activated. All of this creates pervasive cellular instability, which in turn contributes to the development of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of various genetic processes, including imprinting, contributes to the development of cancer. An example of how imprinting in particular can be disrupted is found in the case of Wilm's tumors. In a normal paternal chromosome 11, the imprint control region (ICR) near the gene coding for igf2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) is methylated via imprinting. This means that CTCF does not bind to the ICR, allowing enhancers to work on stimulating expression of igf2 rather than a near-by H19 gene. The opposite is true in maternal chromosome 11. The ICR is unmethylated, so CTCF binds to the ICR, which "re-directs" the enhancers to promote expression of H19 (and not igf2). In those who develop Wilm's tumors, the maternal allele runs like the paternal allele: the ICR is methylated, so igf2 ends up being over-expressed because both paternal and maternal alleles are coding for its expression, while H19 is under-expressed. Igf2 is growth-promoting, and in this case leads to Wilm's tumor development.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine has been used to treat certain forms of cancer for several decades now. It is a DNMTi drug, meaning it inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). This causes demethylation of the genes it affects, which leads to expression of the gene in question. This happens because the drug is incorporated into the DNA of the cell during replication and binds DNMT irreversibly, so it can't methylate genes. It seems very likely at least some of the genes affected include tumor-supressing genes, which tend to become hypermethylated in incidents of cancer. Because DNMTi depends on gene replication to work, and because cancer cells by definition replicate quickly, these cells are most affected.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs altering DNA methylation can have a long-term impact on gene expression. This is because DNA methylation marks are mitotically heritable, meaning they are replicated along with the DNA and passed on to daughter cells. In addition, if drugs that alter DNA methylation are given to a person during certain sensitive periods, it is possible they may alter genetic expression not only in the person's own somatic cells, but also in the cells of their children and even grandchildren. A sensitive period is a limited period of time in development when specific changes are taking place in an organism. Whatever changes are happening at that time can be enhanced or disrupted by exposure to certain elements/experiences. Sensitive periods include right after conception (when epigenetic marks are cleared and reset in the child's cells) and part-way through pregnancy (when the same is happening in the gametes of the child in utero). The first two decades of life in general are a sensitive period, as a child's gametes are maturing (and other systems, too, even neurologically until the mid-20s). If we give such drugs during these times, we risk disrupting normal methylation processes in the person, their children, or even later generations.</div>
