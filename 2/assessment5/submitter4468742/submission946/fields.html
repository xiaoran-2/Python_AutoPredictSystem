    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpGs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated while CpG islands tend to be unmethylated. The methylation of a CpG island is associated with the silencing of the gene, while its unmethylated state is associated with the expression of the gene. The methylation at the repetitive elements is one of the mechanisms with which these are silenced in order to prevent illegitimate recombination. In cancer, CpG islands tend to get methylated thus silencing the respective genes. On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be demethylated in cancer. In this way, the risk of illegitimate recombination rises due to the activation of the repetitive elements. This contributes to the genomic instability of cancer cells. On the other hand, the silencing of genes via the methylation of CpG islands can negatively affect the expression of tumor suppressor genes which impairs the cell's normal function further. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele, the promotor region of H19 is methylated which leads to a silencing of the gene; it is not expressed from the paternal allele. So the nearby enhancers can act on Igf2 which is then expressed from the paternal allele. <br />On the maternal allele, the promotor region of H19 is not methylated which means that the nearby enhancers can act directly on H19 which is then expressed from the maternal allele. Igf2 on the other hand is shielded on the maternal allele via the binding of CTCF and thus not expressed from it.<br />In Wilm's tumour, the paternal allele gets hypomethylated so it acts like a maternal allele. In consequence, Igf2 is not expressed while H19 is expressed from both alleles. Since Igf2 is a growth restriction gene and H19 a growth promoting gene this contributes to the deregulation of cell growth that is one of the hallmarks of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNMT-inhibitors. Since DNMT is required for the establishment/upkeeping of DNA methylation, inhibiting it results in an overall decrease of DNA methylation. This can have an anti-tumour effect in tumours that stem from hypermethylation of CpG islands.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. That means that altering these marks has an effect not only during the time of treatment but in all daughter cells of the treated cells.<br />A sensitive period is characterised by the establishment of epigenetic marks. They occur during early embryonal development (up to the blastocyst stage) and during the primary germ cell development. Drugs that alter the epigenome shouldn't be given to pregnant women since their unborn children undergo these sensitive phases and the epigenome of their cells would be affected.<br /></div>
