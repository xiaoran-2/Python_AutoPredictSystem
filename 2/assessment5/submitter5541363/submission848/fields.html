    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the case of H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region (ICR) is <strong>methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele</strong>. So H19/Igf2 it’s paternally imprinted. The unmethylation in the maternal allele allows CTCF to bind the ICR, and so the enhancers act on H19 and Igf2 remains silenced. In the case of the paternal allele, the methylation of the ICR avoids the binding of CTCF, so the enhancers can act on Igf2 and Igf2 is expressed.<br />In cancer cells, the imprint control regions (ICRs) are hypermethylated or hypomethylated, this leads to <strong>loss of imprinting</strong> of this cells, which implies that instead of monoallelic, expression the gene becomes express from both parental alleles or silence from both parental alleles. This is important in cancer context given that usually genes that are imprinted are or growth promoters or growth suppressors.<br />In the case of Wilm’s tumour, the ICR of H19/Igf2 is hypermethylated, so there is a loss of imprinting and both alleles (maternal and parental) are expressed. These leads to an <strong>overexpression of Igf2</strong>, which is a growth promoting. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the methylation of 5’ group of cytosines within CpG
dinucleotides. <b><br /><br />CpG islands</b> are clusters of CpGs usually found in promoter section of the gene. Generally,
these tend to be <b>unmethylated</b> and his methylation involves the silence of the
gene expression. Thus, the normal function of CpG islands methylation is
silencing the gen expression, either allowing the condensation of the
chromation or avoiding the binding of the transcription factor. An example of
normal CpG islands methylation can be observed in the inactivated X. Contrary
to the normal status, <b>in cancer cells, CpG islands tend to
become hypermethylated</b>, causing then the silencing of the underlying gen. This
disruption of the DNA methylation at CpG contributes to cancer because it
provokes the<b> silencing of tumor suppressor genes, which control cell cycle,
apoptosis or DNA repair</b>.

<br /><p><span>On the
other hand,<b> intergenetic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated</b>,
and so silence, in “normal” cells. These allows the maintain of the genomic integrity/stability given that the silencing of
intergenic <span>avoids
cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites, </span>while the silencing of repetitive elements prevent the
transposition as well as illegitimate recombination and transcriptional interference
from strong </span>promoters. <strong>In cancer cells, there is an hypomethylation at intergenic
regions and repetitive elements, causing then genomic instability</strong>.  <br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a DNA <b>methyltransferase inhibitor</b>. Decitabine inhibits the DNMT by
binding them <strong>irreversibly</strong>. Specifically, Decitabine is a nucleosides analog
that gets incorporated into the DNA in a replication-depending manner. Once
incorporated, when the cell divides and DNMT comes to copy the methylation into
the unmethylated strain, the drug binds the DNMT and avoids it. So it’s
believed that al least in part his anti-tumour effect is due to the
<strong>demethylation of the DNA</strong> that was hypermethylated.</span>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of the drug treatment because the heritability of the epigenetic marks. Specifically, methylation takes place in CpG dinucleotides that are symmetrical in both strains of DNA. When the cell divides, DNMT1 recognizes the hemi-methylated DNA (one strain methylated, the other not) and lays down methylation in the “new” strain. 

</p><p>Sensitive period equals to periods of <b>epigenetic reprogramming</b>. During these periods, environmental changes have much more impact on the epigenetic control. We can distinct two major sensitive periods: <b>primordial germ cell development</b> and <b>pre-implantation period</b>. Also there are sensitive periods specific on the development of each organ.<br /></p></div>
