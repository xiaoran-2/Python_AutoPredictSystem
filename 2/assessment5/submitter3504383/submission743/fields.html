    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">In non-disease states CpG islands are usually hypomethylated relative to CpG dinucleotides elsewhere in the genome. This hypomethylation exists independently of whether their associated genes are active. In cancer this pattern is disrupted and CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated. This causes silencing of the associated (local) gene. In normal tissue, intragenic regions and repetitive sequences are typically methylated. In cancer, this pattern is disrupted and intragenic and repetitive regions are often hypomethylated. Hypomethylation of repetitive sequences in cancerous cells leads to genomic instability as the sequences are able to replicate throughout the genome. Another form of genomic instability is caused by hypomethylation of intragenic regions that can lead to increased DNA recombination in cancerous cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In non-cancerous cells, the H19 and IGF2 genes are imprinted: the maternal H19 and the paternal IGF2 genes are expressed, the maternal IGF2 and paternal H19 genes are repressed. In these normal cells there are methylated sites upstream of H19 on the paternal allele which are hypomethylated on the maternal allele. A CTCF binding site is disrupted by this methylation on the paternal allele. This CTCF binding event prevents enhancers from activating IGF2 on the maternal allele whilst no such event occurs on the paternal allele. In Wilm's tumour both alleles are hypermethylated and CTCF cannot bind to either allele. The enhancers activate IGF2 on both alleles and the cell has a double dosage of IGF2 expression. IGF2 is an oncogene that promotes cell growth and this contributes to the cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferases. It is a DNA-demethylating agent, that is it reduces DNA methylation. Decitabine irreversibly binds DNMTs to DNA during replication. This has the effect of preferentially reducing DNA methylation in quickly dividing cells such as cancer. Many cancers exhibit hypermethylation and reducing this can have an anti-tumour effect.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, that is it persists through cell division. Therefore drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that can persist into all descendants of the cells treated. This is an enduring effect. A sensitive period is a period of development where changes in epigenetic state can have large effects on gene regulation. These sensitive periods occur in early development when the primordial germ cells are established and also as the fertilised egg develops into the blastocyst. Sensitive periods are exactly that: sensitive. Drugs that change epigenetic state would likely have far greater side-effects during these periods compared to their side-effects in cells which have a more established less sensitive epigenome. This makes it inadvisable to treat patients with such drugs during sensitive periods.<br /></div>
