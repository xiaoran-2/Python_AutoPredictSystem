    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">1- DNA methylation at CpG islands  tends to turn off genes<br />2- In cancer, CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated<br />3- In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated and this is more likely to silence tumor suppressor genes causing the hyeperproliferation<br />4- Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in normal cells, this hypermethylation is necessary to maintain genome stability and inhibits illegitimate recombination.<br />5- In cancer there is a hypomethylation of intergnic regions and repetitive elements <br />6- The hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements can cause their own activation, these genes will be able to make a copy of themselves and tronspose causing either disruption of a coding region of another gene or activate neighbouring genes and therfore causing transcritionnal aberrations in these genes leading or promoting cancer<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1- The imprinting control region of the paternal allele is hypermethylated, the enhancers act on Igf2 causing its expression<br />2- The ICR of the maternal allele is hypomethylated, the enhancers act on H19, Igf2 is silenced.<br />3- In Wilm's tumor, there is a hypermethylation in the ICR of the maternal allele, therefore causing the expression of Igf2 in a double dose<br />4- The disruption of H19/Igf2 causes an overexpression of Igf2, since Igf2 is growth promoting, it contributes to cancer<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1- Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents class<br />2- Decitabine decreases DNA methylation<br />3- Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect by demethylating tumor suppressor genes therefore allowing their expression<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1- Epigenetic changes like altering DNA methylation can have enduring 
effects on the epigenome because they are passed on during cell division
 to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased<br /></div>
