    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">CpG island methylation marks the newly-synthesized DNA strand and that way helps with proofreading of duplicated DNA strand.  When CpGs are present in promoters of some genes, methylation may lead to silencing of the gene.  If the gene is a tumor-suppressor gene, methylation of its promoter CpG interferes with its normal function thus promoting cancer growth.  Such methylation is an alternative way to genetic mutation in which cancer is promoted and in fact is more frequent than genetic mutations.  In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are more likely to be methylated than the CpG islands; the opposite is true in cancer cells.  Hypomethylation of repeats leads to genomic instability by promoting illigitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of criptic promoters (and disruption of neighboring genes).  Hypomethylated repeats can jump around the genome further disrupting other genes.  There is evidence for that from mouse studies (e.g. when DMNT removed from specific tissues, cancer develops in mouse), and in humans (e.g., ICF syndrome,  which is characterized by genomic instability).  Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can result in activation of genes that can contribute to cancer (e.g., R-RAS or miR21 which targets PTEN tumor suppressor in glioma).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cell, the imprint control region of paternal allele is methylated, as is the H19 gene, and that causes the enhancers to promote formation of igf2.  Igf2 production is blocked on the maternal allele because the ICR is unmethylated and that allows an insulator element CTCF to stick to ICR blocking igf2 expression -- in that case the enhancers promote formation of H19.  In Wilm's tumor, both, the paternal and the maternal alleles are methylated leading to a double dose of igf2 being produced.  In effect, the maternal allele "behaves" like another paternal allele.  The increased level of igf2 is being observed even in pre-neoplastic tissues.  Igf2 is a growth factor that promotes various types of cancer.  Therefore, hypermethylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster which leads to high level of Igf2 may lead to tumorigenesis in case of Wilm's tumor.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is used as DNA-demethylating agent in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes.  This drug is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  It is a nucleoside analog which binds irreversibly to DNMT after incorporation into DNA molecule therefore is replication-dependent.  Has anti-neoplastic effect at low doses and is very toxic and less effective at high doses.  Decitabine is non-specific in its action, its mechanism of action is unknown, and its long-term effects on cells unaffected by cancer are also not known.  It is probably effective in hematologic cancers because these cancers depend on tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation (hypermethylation of CpG islands -- and Decitabine prevents that).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, then if epigenetic marks (for example, methylation) can be removed by a drug, cancer may be treated without even killing its cells -- cancer may be prevented from growing.  Although researchers are not sure why, cells treated with epigenetic drugs make cancer cells less malignant and so more susceptible to regular chemotherapy treatment.  A synergistic effect is observed between epigenetic drugs and regular chemotherapy -- both types of drugs are more effective together than each on its own.  On the other hand, because epigenetic drugs work broadly, on many cells, removing epigenetic marks also in healthy cells, such drugs may have negative consequences on normal cells that are prevented by the drug from normal development.  That would be especially true in young patients whose cells are actively dividing and differentiating.  That can have an especially detrimental effect during sensitive periods -- early development and germ cell development -- as that's when the epigenetic marks which determine the proper functioning of the cells are laid down.  If epigenome of healthy cells is interfered with by drugs, that may lead to serious problems in its own right, even if no genetic changes are made.</div>
