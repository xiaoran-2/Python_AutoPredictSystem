    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that belongs to the group of
DNA-demethylating agents.  Decitabine
inhibits DNA-methyltransferases and as a result, DNA becomes
hypomethylated. </p><p>Hypermethylation of DNA has been found in many types of
cancer. Hypermethylation is link to silencing of gene expression, promoters of
genes that are hypermethylated are unlikely to be express. If this
hypermethylation occurs at promoters of tumor suppressor genes, these genes
will be silenced and tumors can grow. Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect
because iinhibits DNA-methyltransferases. Tumors treated with decitabine will be then hypomethylated and possible tumor suppressor genes that were silenced in
those tumors due to hypermethylation will be expressed, contributing to the
suppression of the tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification where a methyl group is added onto the fifth carbon of a Cytosine base in a DNA chain. In mammals, this methylation occurs almost exclusively at Cytosines that are followed by Guanines and they are called CpG di-nucleotides. Because the bases are symmetrical, this methylation can be easily inherited during mitosis to the daughter strains and this is important in cancer.</p><p>CpG Islands are regions of chromatin where these CpG occur at high frequencies. In normal cells and tissues, these regions are found to be hypomethylated, they tend to be precluded from methylation. In some types of cancer like colorectal cancer, glioma and neuroblastoma, these regions have been described to be hypermethylated at CpG islands and at the shores of CpG islands, 2 Kb upstream or downstream. When gene promoters are hypermethylated they are unlikely to be expressed. This hypermethylation, specially the one at the shores of the CpG islands is likely to affect surrounding genes silencing their expression. When tumor suppressor genes are silenced due to hypermethylation, this silencing can contribute to the disease.</p><p>Intergenic Regions (IR) and Repetitive Elements (RE) are regions of DNA where CpG are methylated in normal mammalian cells. The function of DNA methylation at IRs and REs is to maintain genomic integrity. At the IR methylation can avoid unwanted splicing of genes or expression of cryptic promoters. RE are patterns of sequences that occur in multiple copies throughout the genome. They have strong promoters that can be shut down through methylation, which also helps to compact chromatin, restricting recombination between repeats. Hypomethylation at ER can result in genomic instability with insertions, deletions or translocations occurring in chromosomes. This genomic instability is central to carcinogenesis</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 is a cluster in human Chr. 11. In this cluster,
there is an Imprinted Control Region (ICR) between Igf2 and H19. </p><p>On the
paternal allele, this ICR is methylated and this methylation expands to the
promoter of the H19 silencing this gene. The insulator protein CTCF cannot bind
to this methylated ICR and the Igf2 enhancers that are downstream of H19 can
act on Igf2 and promote its expression. </p>

<p>On the maternal allele, this ICR is not methylated, the
insulator protein CTCF can bind to this region and can block the communication
between Igf2 and its enhancers; these enhancers are then free to act on H19 and
promote its expression.</p>

<p>Igf2 is a growth promoting gene normally express only from
the paternal allele. In Wilm’s tumor, there is loss of imprinting and high
hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele. Since both alleles are
methylated, CTCF 4 cannot bind and the enhancers of both alleles can act on
Igf2 expression. In Wilm’s tumor, Igf2 is highly expressed because it is
express from both maternal and paternal alleles, and since it is a growth
promoting gene it contributes to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A drug that alters DNA methylation can have enduring effects
because epigenetics changes are transmitted through mitosis. If we have a
particular cancer in which regions of DNA are hypomethylated and the lack of
methylation allows the expression of growth promoting genes, we will have and
uncontrolled growth of cells that will produce cancer. If we can promote
methylation through a drug in this hypomethylated region, those growth
promoting genes will be silenced. These epigenetic silencing marks will be
inherited by the daughter cell and by the granddaughter cells, which will no
longer have those growth promoting genes active.</p>

<p>A sensitive period is a period when the epigenetic marks are
reprogrammed, when these marks are cleared and reset. There are two sensitive
periods in human development, one is in early development in the
pre-implantation embryo and the other one is when the primordial germ cells
develop in the mid-gestation embryo. The marks laid down on those two
periods are essential for the further development of the individual. Treating
patients with epigenetics drugs during those periods will be inadvisable
because it could alter the epigenetic map of that patient in a random way with
unpredictable consequences. </p></div>
