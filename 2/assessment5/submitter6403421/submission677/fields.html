    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p><ul><li>CpG
islands, often at promotors of genes, are normally unmethylated and hence are
those genes not silenced.<br /></li><li>In
cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated. </li><li>The hypermethylation can lead to tumor
suppressor genes silencing.<br /></li><li>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive regions are normally methylated, acting to silence "junk" genes. </li><li>In cancer these regions have a genome-wide lack of methylation. The location of the hypomethylation decides the outcome of the hypomethylation. </li><li>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability which in turn can lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and disruption to neighbouring genes. It occurs to some degree in all tumour types. </li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The paternal H19 gene is normally methylated and silenced. When H19 and the ICR are methylated, the insulator protein CTCF can't bind to and the ICR and block enhancers. Downstream enhancers can then activate Igf2. Paternally Igf2 is activated.  </li><li>The maternal H19 gene is un methylated and expressed. When H19 and the ICR are un methylated, the insulator protein CTCR  binds to the ICR and insulates Igf2 from the enhancers and then also from expression. </li><li>In Wilm's tumour, both the maternal and the paternal allele are hypermethylated at the H19 gene and its imprint control region.This leads to both maternal and paternal expression of Igf2. </li><li>When  Igf2 (insulin growth factor 2) which is a growth factor leading to increased cell growth is over expressed, the cell is promoted for extended growth which can contribute to cancer. </li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a antineoplatic medication which is a pyrimidine analogue. It is acting by inhibition of DNA-methyl transferases (DNMTi), which gives hyopmethylation of promotors that can reactivate tumour suppressor genes. <span>Decitabine is given in low doses to act on the DNA methylation. It binds </span>irreversibly to DNA methyltransferase and is therefore replication independent. In this way it has an anti-tumour effect by stabilising the carcinogenic methylation pattern. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation is heritable due to the function of DNA-methyl transferases (DNMT). When the DNA-methylation is inherited in future cell divisions, the DNA methylation can have enduring effects. In x-inactivation the epigenome is affected permanently by DNA methylation leading to inactivation of one of the X-es. </li><li>A sensitive period is e.g. during the epigenetic reprogramming between generations. It is a period when the epigenetic reprogramming is set and the epigenetics is sensitive to alterations with respect to development. </li><li>There are two major sensitive periods during development; primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation early development.</li><li>Treating patients during sensitive periods can affect the offspring and result in epigenetic abnormalities with deviations in imprinting. </li></ul></div>
