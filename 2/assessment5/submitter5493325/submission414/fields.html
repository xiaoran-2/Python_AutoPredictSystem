    <h1>Submission 414 from Anon (session_user_id: 8532e060e74837c44bd2e01a4849f081450084b6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA
Methyl-trasnferases inhibitor (DNMTi) and therefore is a DNA-demethylating
agent. It is sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company and is used to treat
myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.<br /><br />
Decitabine inhibits DNA Methyl-transferases and as a consequence every time a
cell divides the methylation marks cannot be established again and new cells
will have demethylated DNA.<br /><br />
Drugs like Decitabine may be really useful because they are capable of reverse
the hypermethylation of CpG islands that are typical in cancer. Tumor suppressor
genes are silenced by this hypermethylations which are mitotically heritable.
Low doses of Decitabine can remove these methyl groups allowing tumor
suppressors to act against tumor cells causing few side effects.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG
islands are methylated to silence the surrounding genes; normally these CpG
islands are hypomethylated. But in cancer, these CpG islands are
hypermethyalted, especially the ones that silence tumor suppressor genes. The
hypermethylation of these CpG islands on tumor suppressor genes cause the
silencing of these genes and therefore they cannot act against tumor cells,
contributing to cancer.</p>

<p>The
normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions is to maintain the
genomic stability; normally intergenic regions are hypermethylated, in order to
silence repetitive elements, which may cause genomic instability by the illegitimate
recombinations they may have. In cancer, these intergenic regions are
hypomethylated, allowing recombinations between the repetitive elements and
therefore, causing genomic instability because they cause chromosomal rearrangements
and genetic disruptions which may contribute to cancer.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
paternal allele is methylated on the imprinted control region, because of that,
the insulator protein CTCF cannot bind to this imprinted region and the enhancers
can act on Igf2 causing its expression. Whereas on the maternal allele the imprinted
control region is unmethylated and the insulator protein CTCF bind to the
imprinted control region. CTCF then insulates Igf2 from the downstream
enhancers and therefore they cannot bind to Igf2 and promote its expression,
instead they will enhance the long non-coding RNA H19.</p>

<p><span>In Wilm’s tumor both the maternal and paternal
imprinted region is methylated, as a consequence both alleles will act as the
normal paternal allele and in both cases Igf2 is expressed. Igf2 will be
expressed double and the lncRNA H19 will be not expressed. This will cause Wilm’s
tumor, a child kidney tumor.</span><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically
heritable, that means that epigenetic changes are transmitted from a cell to a daughter
cell and this daughter cell to its daughter cells too. If these changes are
erased, they will not be established again. As a consequence, if DNA
methylation is erased when treating a tumor, even when the treatment has ended,
the methylations will not be established again. Therefore, altering DNA
methylation may have enduring effects on the epigenome.<br /><br />
In epigenetics a sensitive period refers to a period in which the epigenetic
marks are removed and established de novo.<br /><br />
In humans there are two sensitive periods: During early embryonic development
and during germ cell development.<br /><br />
Treating young patients may be really dangerous because they are developing
their germ cells, a sensitive period where epigenetic marks are being
established. If we remove or alter these epigenetic marks in order to treat a
cancer the future descendants of the patients may have problems due to the
changes caused, because as it has said before, these alterations on the DNA
methylation are mitotically heritable.<br />
That is also true when treating a pregnant woman, which is even worse as it
will directly affect the developing of the embryo.<br /></p></div>
