    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>DNA methylation is a normal process in cells. It is necessary for x-inactivation, silencing and imprinting.</p><p>CpG islands are shot sequences of a cytosine nucleotide next to a guanine nucleotide. It plays a regulatory function of genes through their methylation. </p><p>Methylation of Cpg islands near promoters may contribute to a transcriptional silencing of genes.</p><p>Hypomethylation of oncogenes lead to intensive expression and overgrowth of cell mass. </p><p> Intergenic region and repetitive element are highly methylated. It prevents nonspecific transcription. Long sequences of DNA make genome more stable. Deletions and insertions of nucleotides in protein coding regions occur more rarely.</p><p>During cancer process these regions become unmethylated and unstable. That provokes illegitimate chromosome recombination. Activation of intergenic regions may affect neighboring genes. </p><div><span><br /></span></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>Usually the paternal allele of H19 is methyleted and silenced while the maternal is hypomethylated and expressed. The CTCF complex binds to the maternal allele and the downstream enhansers act on H19. On the paternal allele enhansers activate Igf2 because the CTCF complex does not bind due to the methyl marks. It leads to silencing H19.</p><p>In normal cell the paternal allele expresses Igf2 and the maternal allele expresses H19.</p><p>During Wilm's tumour ICR is hypermethylated and both allele are expressed as paternal.  Cells produce a double dose of Igf2 and do not produce any dose of H19.</p><div><span><br /></span></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It causes demethylation in DNA and RNA. Decitabine does not allow to methylate CpG islands in promoter regions and silence genes with tumour-suppression activity. Decitabine is used as a part of treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes.</p><div><span><br /></span></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span><br /></span><p>DNA methylation can be used to intervent to the cancer process. In the list of epigenetic regulations in cell it is the most suitable process because this threatment has enduring effects. Epigenetics methylation marks are inherited through mitosis by DNA methyltransferase.</p><p>It is inadvisable to prescription this medication during sensitive period of epigenetic reprogramming (e.g. first months of pregnancy, especially the formation of gametes). A lot of reprogramming occurs there and additional intervention may interfere with ordinary function.</p><div><span><br /></span></div></div>
