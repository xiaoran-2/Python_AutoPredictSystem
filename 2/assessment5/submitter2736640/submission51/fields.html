    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><div>Areas in the DNA which are rich in cytosine-guanine dinucleotides are called CpG islands.  These CpG islands tend to be found in the promoter regions of genes.  The cytosine in this pairing can be modified through methylation by a DNA methyltransferase and this modification can serve to silence that gene.  Approximately 70-80% of the CpG dinucleotides are modified in this way in somatic cells.   In some cancers there is excessive methylation, called hypermethylation, within the CpG islands.  Hypermethylation found within promoters of genes for tumor suppressor genes which regulate the cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair.  This contributes to the unregulated cell growth, and in some cancers, the degree of CpG island methylation is associated with the potential for metastasis.  </div><div><br /></div><div>Intergenic regions of DNA are those noncoding stretches of DNA located between genes.  These constitute a large proportion of the human genome.  These include repetitive stretches.  In cancer there is tends to be a general reduction on degree of methylation, called hypomethylation, which increases over time.  The loss of methylation in repetitive stretches can result in errors with illegitimate recombination within cancer cells.  It can also result in activation of promoters of genes with repetitive stretches resulting in genomic instability.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting is the transfer of methylation status in particular genes and histones to daughter cells in order to control the expression of genes of either the maternal or paternal origin.  The H19 and insulin-like growth factor 2 (Ifg2) genes are located adjacent to each other and experience different methylation patterns under normal conditions.  The H19 gene is preferentially methylated on the paternal allele and thus silenced.  The Igf2 expression is from the paternal allele of the gene and the maternal Ifg2 allele is silenced through methylation.  Loss of this imprinting results is overexpression of Ifg2, which is an active growth factor, and is associated with some cancers.  When the maternal Ifg2 loses its impriting, then the active H19 gene on the maternal gene can contribute to the overexpression of the growth factor.  This process occurs in a number of cancers, including Wilms' tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltrasferase inhibitor.  It reduces the activity of the enzyme which methylates DNA. It is used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome.   Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue and is incorporated into the DNA and affects the DNA methyltransferase during replication of the DNA.  At low doses, this drug results in a general reduction in DNA methylation and so can allow the reversal of suppression of tumor suppressor genes by hypermethylation.  The tumors that are associated with hypermethylation events are the ones likely to treatable with this type of drug.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Dr. Baylin speculated that epigenetic drugs "altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy."  DNA methylation functions by silencing genes without genetically modifying them and the epigenetic methylation marks can be passed on to the next generation of cells.  It is possible for changes in the methylation state to affect the expression and regulation of generations of cells and so treatment with drugs that alter methylation patterns can have enduring effects on the epigenome.  A sensitive period in epigenetics is a period in development where epigenetic reprogramming and imprinting occur and where changes in epigenetic patterns can affect the organism for their entire lifespan.  Examples would be in the earliy stages of development as well as when during reproduction where the developing embryo would be in a senstive period of development.  Because of the far-ranging possible effects of altering epigenetic marks during sensitive periods, treatment during these times is not advisable.</div><div><br /></div></div>
