    <h1>Submission 1065 from Anon (session_user_id: 7531d712c86dc89d12a120b0253e03a7dbfe95bd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has enduring effects on the epigenome because the
epigenetic marks are faithfully maintained for the life of the cell and its
daughter cells in a tissue i.e. DNA methylation is mitotically inherited in cell lines.</p>

<p>Sensitive periods may be defined as those
periods when DNA methylation is cleared and reset during development.</p>

<p>DNA<span> methylation predominantly occurs during early
cellular development in the embryo, and in the formation of gametes later in
development.  These are the
periods of greatest sensitivity to environmental effects on the genome and the
epigenome.  </span></p>

<span>Treating patients during sensitive periods is
inadvisable because the enzymes and drugs which have effects on cancers through disrupting epigenetic processes, are
also having effects on normal cellular processes and therefore may have
widespread and devastating consequences on physiology, metabolism and
development of a patient.</span><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In many mammalian cells, CpG islands are associated
with the promoter region of genes and are associated with gene expression.  In normal tissue they are usually unmethylated
or hypomethylated, allowing for expression of the following gene(s).</span></p>

<p>In cancer, CpG islands tend to be
hypermethylated, causing the silencing of the underlying gene.  In cancer
disruption of CpG island DNA<span> methylation  in the promoter
regions of genes leads to silencing of the underlying gene. </span></p>

<p>CpG island hypermethylation has been
described in almost every tumour type and many cellular pathways are
inactivated by this type of epigenetic lesion including DNA repair, cell cycle,
apoptosis, cell adherence, and detoxification etc . . .</p>

<p>Intragenic DNA demethylation and
repetitive elements play a part in chromatin compartmentalization and gene
regulation, i.e. they play a part in the 3D arrangement of DNA<span> within the nucleus.  Intragenic and intergenic regions are widely
modulated during physiological processes and disease, and seem to be actively
involved in multiple gene regulation processes.   </span></p>

<p>Intragenic DNA methylation may be
involved in alternative promoter usage, regulation of short and long non-coding
RNAs, alternative RNA processing, and enhancer activity.</p>

<p><span>This is disrupted in cancer by providing or
denying access to genes for transcription or silencing, resulting in
over-expression or under-expression of the gene product (protein or RNA).  This in turn leads to silencing of
tumour-suppressor genes and the expression of oncogenes.</span></p>

<span>Approximately half of the human genome is made
of repetitive elements.  Hypomethylation
of repetitive </span>DNA<span> elements is a common epigenetic event in cancer and although
it is believed that this impacts chromosomal and transcriptional stability of
the genome, the extent of the contribution of repetitive sequences to the
development and progression of human cancers remains to be clarified.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Genomic imprinting is the result of epigenetic
marking of genes in a parent-of-origin-specific manner.  This ensures the stable transmission of mono-allelic
gene expression patterns. Epigenetic marking systems are able to regulate gene
activity independently of the underlying </span>DNA<span> sequence. Several
imprinted gene products regulate cell proliferation and foetal growth.  Loss of their imprinted state, which
effectively alters their dosage, might promote or suppress tumour growth.  lncRNAs (Long non-coding RNAs) are involved
in imprinting through their effect on imprint-control-regions.</span></p>

<p><span>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to
cancer through over-expression of the Igf2 gene which is involved in
regulating cell growth.  </span></p>

<p><span>In the paternal allele
the H19 imprint control region is normally methylated leading to silencing of
H19 and expression of Igf2. </span></p>

<p><span>In the maternal allele, the H19 imprint
control region is normally expressed and the upstream Igf2 is silenced.  A transcription factor, CTCF binds within the
H19 imprint control region, and prevents the downstream enhancers from
interacting with the upstream Igf2. </span></p>

<span>In Wilms tumour, epigenetic factors prevent the
CTCF binding and allow for hypermethylation of the H19 imprint control region,
leading to its silencing and allowing over-expression of Igf2, i.e. the
maternal chromosome behaves like the paternal chromosome.</span><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA<span>-demethylating
drug.  It is believed to exert its anti-neoplastic
effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into </span>DNA<span>.  <br /></span></p><p>Inhibition of DNA methyltransferase,
causes hypomethylation of DNA<span> and cellular differentiation or apoptosis.  Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in rapidly-dividing
cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of
cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the
cytotoxicity of Decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent
adducts between </span>DNA methyltransferase and Decitabine incorporated into DNA. </p>

It is believed that this hypomethylation caused
by Decitabine affects the regulation of gene expression, cell cycle, DNA damage, and apoptosis.  In this way
Decitabine has an anti-tumour effect through detection of DNA<span> damage and inducing cell death.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
