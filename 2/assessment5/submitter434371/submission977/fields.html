    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands in promoters is associated with gene silencing.  In general, in a normal cell, the CpG islands are not methylated, allowing for gene expression.  Cancer is associated with hypermethylation, or increased methylation, of CpG islands, which leads to silencing of gene expression.  Often, this hypermethylation is found at tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressor genes decrease tumor formation.  Therefore, silencing tumor suppressor genes can lead to an increased probability of cancer formation.  A good example of this type of epigenetic modification would be with the tumor suppression gene BRCA1.  BRCA1 is associated with DNA repair and the repair of chromosomal damage.  If this gene is silenced by DNA methylation, mutations can accumulate in the DNA, increasing the risk of cancer.  Different types of tumors are often associated with the silencing of different sets of tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br />The opposite is true for DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  In a normal cell, the DNA in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements is methylated, silencing these parts of the genome.  During cancer progression, the DNA in these areas becomes hypomethylated, or undermethylated, thereby activating these areas.  This hypomethylation leads to genomic instability.  The repetitive elements on two different chromosomes can mis-align, leading to unwanted recombination events.  These repetitive elements are also often associated with transposable elements, which, when activated, can move around.  Their insertion into different areas of the genome can lead to inactivation or activation of genes.  Also, "cryptic" promoters in these areas can become active, increasing gene expression of oncogenes and thereby increasing cancer risk. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting ensures that expression of an imprinted gene will only occur from one of the parental chromosomes; gene expression is silenced on the other chromosome. An example of how loss of gene imprinting can lead to cancer is the H19/Igf2 cluster.  On the maternal chromosome, the imprint control region (IRC) is not methylated, allowing the insulating protein CTF2 to bind to the IRC.  The downstream enhancer sequences cannot interact with the promoter for Igf2, but instead interact with the H19 promoter. On the paternal chromosome, the IRC is methylated, and this methylation spreads to the promoter for H19 preventing the binding of CTF2, and allowing downstream enhancers to interact with the promoter for Igf2.  Igf2 is expressed from the paternal chromosome and not the maternal chromosome.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, the IRC on the maternal chromosome is hypermethylated, and the CTF2 insulating protein is not able to bind.  Therefore, the downstream enhancers can interact with the Igf2 promoter, and Igf2 is expressed from both the paternal and maternal chromosomes.  This  doubles the expression of Igf2.  Igf2 is involved in growth.  Overexpression would increase levels of Igf2 and increase of the risk of cancer due to uncontrolled cell growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, and leads to the hypomethylation of DNA (under-methylation).  It is a nucleotide analog (cytodine analog) that gets incorporated into the DNA and then binds irreversibly to DNA methyltransferase, inhibiting its action.  Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic disease and AML, a leukemia.  These blood cancers are often associated with hypermethylation, or silencing, of certain tumor suppressor genes.  Inhibition of DNA methylation may therefore allow expression of the tumor suppression genes, decreasing tumor progression.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have effects on the epigenome because epigenetic changes can be mitotically inherited.  This means that daughter cells will have the same epigenetic marks as the parental cell.  So if you alter a tumor cell, each of its progeny can be altered in the same manner, so that maybe you do not have to affect every single cancer cell to have an affect.<br /><br />A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are removed so they can be reset.  The two sensitive periods are during early embryonic development (preimplantation), and during primordial germ cell development, or the formation of sperm and egg cells.  Caution should be used when treating someone at a young age, when they are developing germ cells, because any epigenetic marks affected during this time period could be inherited by future progeny.  An example I can think of is that during germ cell development, methylation at repetitive elements is maintained.  If you treat with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor during this time period, you may alter this DNA methylation, which could be passed to any offspring, creating genomic instability.<br /></div>
