    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, the CpG islands tend to be hypomethylated whereas the intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypermethylated. In a cancer cell, the opposite is true. The CpG islands would be hypermethylated and the intergenic regions along with repetitive elements would be hypomethylated. Hypermethylation of CpG islands increase the chance of silencing tumor suppressor genes. In some cancers, it is this silencing of tumor suppressor genes that is the main driving force that allows the cancer to propagate in an uncontrolled fashion. When intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated, it creates genomic stability. When these regions are hypomethylated, as we observe in cancer cells, it leads to copying errors such as insertions, deletions and translocations. These mutations can lead the development or progression of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell at the H19/Igf2 cluster, there is methylation of the ICR on the paternal allele and there is no methylation on the maternal allele. On the paternal allele, Igf2 is expressed when the CTCF complex is unable to bind to the allele due to the methyl groups present leading to the silencing of H19. When H19 is silenced, downstream enhancers promote the expression of Igf2. On the maternal allele, CTCF is free to bind to the allele due to the lack of methylation and as a result, downstream enhancers promote the expression of H19. In a normal cell, we would see normal doses of Igf2 from the paternal allele and H19 from the maternal allele. In the case of a Wilm's tumour, ICR is hypermethylated resulting in both alleles functioning as paternal alleles, and as a result, the cell would get a double dose of Igf2 with no dose of H19 leading to uncontrolled growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to class of drugs called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. As an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, it leads to the hypomethylation of DNA. The anti tumour effect of Decitabine as seen in myelodysplastic syndrome, has been linked to the reactivation of tumor suppressor genes through hypomethylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable through the action of DNA methyltransferase and as a result, once it has been altered it can have lasting effects even after the administration of the drug has ceased. While this property of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is desirable in treating a tumor, it can produce adverse effects when normal functions of methylation are disrupted. The sensitive period could be defined as a time when extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs and leaves the normal cells particularly vulnerable to unwanted disruptions in methylation. In human development, there are two two waves of reprogramming in which DNA methylation is wiped clear from the genome and laid back down. The first is the pre-implantation period of early development and the second is primordial germ cell development. Disruption of the methylation process during these sensitive periods would likely lead to profound effects on embryonic development, possible leading to a miscarriage. Therefore it is inadvisable to treat women who are pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant.</div>
