    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands in gene promoters can be either methylated or unmethylated, depending on whether the gene is active or not, while the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. The methylation in CpG islands generally results in gene silencing. In cancer there is a trend of hypermethylation of CpG islands of promoters and therefore for the silencing of genes, such as tumor suppressing genes. Also, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements suffer a hypomethylation, which brings about genomic instability. This instability is related to the activation of repeats and their transposition to other locations of the genome, having the potential to disrupt genes and alter their expression. The illegitimate recombination between repeats can also occur, possibly leading to chromosomal abnormalities (Material used: course slides).<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR (imprint control region) of the maternal allele is unmethylated, while the ICR of the paternal allele is methylated. In the maternal unmethylated ICR, the insulating factor CTCF binds. This binding isolates the Igf2 gene from the action of enhancers, so the gene is not expressed. However, on the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, so the CTCF factor does not bind and the enhancers can promote the expression of Igf2. In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele is also methylated, just like the paternal allele. This means that Igf2 will be expressed on both alleles, so there is an overexpression of this gene. Since this is a growth promoting gene, its overexpression will contribute to the formation of cancer (Material used: course slides).<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors. This drug is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated in DNA. Once DNMT binds to this compound, the binding is irreversible. In this way, it promotes the passive demethylation of DNA. Since this drug is dependent on replication to become incorporated in DNA, it is especially effective against cells that divide rapidly, such as cancer cells (Material used: course slides).<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is correlated with the silencing of genes, through the methylation of CpG islands. Altered DNA methylation can have effects on the epigenome because genes that are associated with the epigenetic machinery can be silenced through methylation. If these disruptions alter the epigenetic factors, and since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, then the methylation could become permanent for the life-time of the organism, leading to a permanent effect on the epigenome. In the sensitive periods of development, namely during primordial germ cell development and early development, the epigenetic marks are removed and reset. So these periods are sensitive to exogenous factors that can alter the setting of epigenetic marks. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable, since this could affect the setting of epigenetic marks, which could alter the epigenome and become permanent <span>(Material
