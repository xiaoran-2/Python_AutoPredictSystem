    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><br />DNA methylation is the modification of C5 position of cytosine. It is very common (70-80%) of CpG islands in mammalian somatic cells.  It is laid down by DNA methyltransferrases and is mitotically inheritable. It is responsible for genetic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and formation of chromatin. Its function is also associated with gene silencing at promoters; it  helps in maintaining genomic stability.<br />In cancer cells DNA methylation is  reversed: CpG islands are hyper methylated - this activates the oncogenes and inactivates tumor suppressor genes. <br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hyper methylated normally - in cancer cells this is reversed those regions are hypomethylated. This leads to genomic instability resulting in illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes.<br />DNA methylation is context dependent -   In the case of tumor suppressor hypermethylation - depletion of DNA can suppress <span>development of tumors; in the case of chromosomal instability DNA methylation can enhance the formation of tumors. </span><p><span></span> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell the paternal allele is methylated, the enhancers act on the Igf2 and it is expressed. <br />The maternal allele has a CTCF protein at the imprint control region and there H19 is expressed, Igf2 is not expressed.<br />In Wilm's tumour cell there is loss of imprinting - there is hypermethylation at both control regions and both the maternal and paternal alleles are methylated. The enhancers act on both alleles and there is a double dose of Igf2, which is growth promoting and leads to Wilm's cancer - childhood kidney tumor.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Although is was deeply hidden (towards the end of the article) the drug Decitabine was indeed mentioned!<br />I think it belongs to a class of Hystone - deacetylase inhibitors. Its impact on DNA methylation is to actually cause demethylation. It is used in cases of myelodyslastic syndromes - the precursor of acute muelogenous leukemia.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA mutilation is mitotically heritable - thus removal of epigenetic marks may be permanent.<br />A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are reestablished - this happens twice during the preimplantaion period and in the premordial germ cells. <br />Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable as it may have negative side-effects - our drugs are not yet targeting just cancer cells - they will have an effect on all cells they come in contact with.</div>
