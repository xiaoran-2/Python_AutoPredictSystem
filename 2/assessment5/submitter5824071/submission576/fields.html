    <h1>Submission 576 from Anon (session_user_id: 0eeb628a225deef75af5ce58f377ccfbfda6fd5f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is
in a class of drugs called DNA-demethylating agents, which is used to treat
myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by
inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. When there is a rise in DNA methylation this
can result in the blockage of the activity of genes that regulate cell division
and growth (called suppressor genes). If suppressor genes are blocked because of hypermethylation, cell
division turn into unregulated, promoting tumour growth. Decitabine exerts its anti-tumour
effect interfering with the methylation of DNA. It works reducing DNA
methylation, thus normal function to the suppressor genes is restored, repairing
control over cell division and growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are short interspersed DNA sequences that deviate significantly from the average genomic pattern by being rich in GC content. They are located at sites of transcription initiation. Thus, DNA methylation at CpG islands produces the silencing of gene expression. In normal cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated while repetitive elements in the intergenic regions and the introns of genes are methylated. On the whole, a normal cell is associated with hypomethylation at CpG islands coupled with hypermethylation at repetitive and intergenic regions, which provides genomic stability. However, in a Cancer cell there are specific DNA hypermethylation at the CpG islands and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation in repetitive regions and introns. Thus, if there is an increase in DNA methylation at CpG islands this can result in the blockage of the activity of suppressor genes that regulate cell division and growth. When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. On the other hand, DNA hypomethylation at repetitive and intergenic regions produces chromosomal instability, which includes illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters, and disruption to neighbouring genes. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, if one cell develops an epigenetic modification, this alteration is passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells, thus enhancing tumour growth. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation (hypo
or hypermethylation) at imprinting control regions (ICRs) can result in cancer.
The cluster of imprinted genes H19/lgf2 shows different methylated pattern in
the maternal allele and the paternal ones. On the paternal allele, the CTCF
does not bind to ICR due to that it is methylated. Thus, enhancers act on lgf2
and promote its expression. On the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated and
this leads to the binding of CTCF. The enhancers are now free to act on H19 and
enhance H19 expression on the maternal allele, while lgf2 is not expressed. Therefore,
Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele and not the maternal allele. In
Wilm’s tumour, not only the ICR of the paternal allele but also the ICR of the maternal
allele are methylated, thus H19 is not expressed and the lgf2 expression is
increased. Likewise, in some types of Cancer, the hypermethylation of the ICR
in the H19/lg2 cluster produces a lower H19 expression that is coupled with
increased Igf2 expression. Overexpression of Igf2 can be responsible for
overgrowth, promoting the development of cancerous tissues.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that inhibit DNA
methyltransferase activity combined with standard chemotherapies have been successfully
used against solid tumours in some patients. These drugs have effects beyond
the treatment due to the epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division
to daughter cells. Each daughter cell will divide into two more daughter cells,
and so on. In this way, over time, tumour cell populations might repair the epigenetic
abnormalities. Therefore, it might be that epigenetic therapies can stop a cancer
growing without having to kill all its cells. Nevertheless, before applying
epigenetic treatments, it is necessary to keep in mind how it could affect
younger patient, particularly during sensitive periods (i.e. the periods during
development in which exist a heightened sensitivity to epigenetic signals). There
are two main sensitivity periods of epigenetic reprogramming: pre-implantation period
in early development, and primordial germ cell development. As an example, if a
younger patient is treated with epigenetic therapies during the period when the
germ cells are developing, the anomalies that are produced in the
epigenetic reprogramming will be transmitted to the next generation. Thus, it
is highly probable that these epigenetic changes could cause serious defects in
the children of these patients.</p></div>
