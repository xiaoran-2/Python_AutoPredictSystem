    <h1>Submission 198 from Anon (session_user_id: 6bab12ac44589600024c2f2edea6713b6a40a6d3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferases inhibitor (DNMTi) that binds to DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) irreversibly. This results in DNA hypomethylation and thus allows the genes previously silenced by DNA hypermethylation can be reexpressed upon treating the cancer cell lines with Decitabine. It is the drug to treat myelodysplastic sundrome progressed to AML.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated whereas the repetitive element, intergenic region and introns are methylated. On the other hand, CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated in cancer cells, and the repetitive element, intergegic region and introns of cancer cells are hypomethylated. CpG islands hypermethylation usually is found at the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. This results in silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Some cancer cells are driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation.<br /><br />In normal cells, repetitive element is methylated in order to form densely packed heterochromatin to promote genome stability. in cancer cells, the repetitive element is hypomethylted, therefore it is loosely packed euchromatin and thus causes genomic instability (e.g. illegitimate recombination between repeats, activationof repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes). Certain cancer cells are driven by chromosomal instability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprint control regions (ICRs) are related with growth. Disruption of imprinting can cause cancer and this is done by either hypermethylation or hypomethylation. One of the examples is the H19/Igf2 cluster. It is found in Chromosome 11.<br /><br />At the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and thus the CTCF insulator protein cannot bind to the ICR. This allows the enhancers to enhance Igf2 expression because this is the prefered loop. Therefore it is paternal imprinted of Igf2. <br /><br />On the other hand, the ICR at the maternal allele is not methylated and it can be bound by CTCF. CTCF insultes Igf2 from downstream enhancers. The enhancers enhance H19 expression instead.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, both the ICRs of paternal and maternal allele are methylated. As a result, there is double the amout of Igf2 and reduced H19. Igf2 is associated with growth promoting in Wilm's tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because the altered DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable. Therefore the demethylating drugs had produced a “memory” anti tumor response.<br /><br />A sensitive period is the period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms.It is the period of establishment of epigenetic marks occurs.<br /><span><br />There are 2 waves of sensitive periods of development. One is the germ cells development (from premodial germ cells till sperm/oocyte is form). The other sensitive period is during pre-implantation development.<br /><br />It would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because this may disrupt the normal establishment of epigenetic marks thus cause epigenetic imprinting disorder and even potential transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.<br /></span><br /></div>
