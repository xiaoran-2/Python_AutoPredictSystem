    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation plays a crucial role in
regulating normal cell growth and reproduction, by means of selective
hyper- and hypomethylation of specific regions. Disruptions in the
methylation of such regions thus play a substantial role in the
development of various cancers. Depending on the context, DNA
methylation can be disrupted either by hypermethylation of normally
hypomethylated regions or by hypomethylation of normally
hypermethylated regions.</p>
<p>CpG islands, and adjoining regions
known as CpG island shores, tend to be located in the promoters of
tumor-suppressor genes. These regions are generally hypo- or
unmethylated in normal cells, resulting in fully functional and
expressed promoters, and the suppression of tumors. In cancerous cells, however, there tends to be a
silencing of tumor-suppressor genes, which is often accomplished
through increasing hypermethylation of these CpG-rich promoters.</p>
<p>The other phenomenon we observe in
cancer cells is genome-wide hypomethylation, mainly of repetitive
regions and intergenetic intervals (more importantly), and of
CpG-poor promoters (less importantly). Most of our genome is not
composed of CpG islands, but rather of repetitive regions an
intergenetic intervals. One of the roles of DNA methylation is to
maintain genetic stability. Because alignment of repetitive regions
can result in genetic recombination of non-homologous chromosomes,
these repetitive regions tend to be both hypermethylated and
heterochromatinized in normal cells, densely packaging the DNA so as
to prevent recombination and expression. In cancer cells, however, we
observe a hypomethylation of these regions. This allows both for
abnormal genetic recombination and expression of these repetitive
regions, permitting them to copy and transpose themselves throughout
the genome. This can disrupt the genes they introduce themselves
into, or it can activate neighboring genes. In addition,
hypomethylation of certain CpG-poor promoters can result in increased
expression of the oncogenes that they regulate or of silencing of the
tumor-suppressor genes that they target.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In some cancers, genes that should be
imprinted are epigenetically disrupted and both alleles show either
paternal or maternal expression, resulting in excessive expression of
certain genes and reduced expression of others. This is the case of
Wilm's tumor.</p>
<p>H19/Igf2 is paternally imprinted, so it
is methylated in the paternal chromosome. DNA methylation at the ICR
blocks the binding of the CTCF protein. Without this protein, DNA
methylation spreads to the H19 promoter to silence it, and the
enhancers act on the Igf2 gene and promote its expression.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the absence of
DNA methylation at the ICR means there is no heterochromatin to
spread to H19, so H19 is not methylated and can be expressed.
Furthermore, the absence of methylation at the ICR allows for the
binding of the CTCF protein to it, which isolates the enhancers from
reaching Igf2 gene (its preferred path) and instead enhance the expression of H19.</p>
<p>Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene
(oncogene), so when the maternal allele is methylated, as in Wilm's
tumor, the child ends up with a double-dose of this oncogene, plus no
dose of the tumor-suppressing Cdkn1c gene (see Lecture 4-4) and therefore excessive cell growth (cancer).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor and
therefore a DNA demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic
syndromes. DNMT is an enzyme that copies methylation from parent to
daughter cell, and Decitabine can inhibit its action. In some
cancers, excessive DNA methylation, especially of CpG islands,
silences the promoters of tumor-suppressor genes. It is possible
that, by reducing DNA methylation through DNMT inhibition, the
promoters of tumor-suppressor genes might be demethylated and their
tumor-suppressing capabilities restored. Decitabine is a nucleotide
analog, so it gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication, such
that when the DNMT comes to bind to that nucleotide to copy the DNA
methylation to the daughter strand, it binds irreversibly to the
nucleotide and is unable to copy the methylation. Because the action
of Decitabine is replication-dependent, and cancer cells replicate
much more frequently than normal cells, its effect on cancer cells is
much stronger than in normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically
heritable, meaning that when a cell replicates, the methylation
patterns are passed on from parent to daughter cells. Alterations in
the epigenome caused by epigenetic drugs can therefore be passed on
through multiple generations of cells, therefore having a lasting
effect and not requiring continuous re-administration of the drug.</p>
<p>Yet it is precisely this long-lasting
effect which may make treating patients during sensitive periods
inadvisable There are periods in human development in which
epigenetic reprogramming occurs, either of all, or of a group of
cells, and in which affecting even one cell could have a severe,
unpredictable, and wide-ranging effect. These are known as sensitive
periods, and they include periods surrounding fertilization, during
germ cell development in the embryo – when more than one generation
could be affected, during tissue-differentiation and organ formation
in the embryo, during childhood and adolescence - when the body and
the reproductive organs and gametes are developing, etc. Broadly
speaking, treating patients with epigenetic drugs who are not past
their reproductive years could present a significant risk to their
offspring and even the offspring of their offspring, and treating
children with such drugs could affect their growth and development.  </p></div>
