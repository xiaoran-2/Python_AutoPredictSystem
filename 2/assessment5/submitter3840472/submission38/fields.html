    <div class="field-value"><p><b>DNA
methylation</b> consists in the addition of a methyl group (CH3) to DNA (double helix that encodes genetic
information). In general, it occurs thank to methyltransferases on C
nucleotides followed by G nucleotide, called called CpG. They
are usually clustered in island. Their methylation silences the gene expression
as they are generally located at their promoter.</p>

<p><span>In cancer, DNA
methylation at<b> </b><b>CpG islands</b> is disrupted in cancer as they
are hypermethylated (cf. fig.1). It is in fact a set of genes that is
concerned, especially the tumor suppressor genes. Thus, they will be silenced
and will not be active against cancer.</span></p>

<p>Moreover, DNA methylation at CpG islands can contribute to disease. For instance, it can
alter imprinted gene expression. That means it can activate or deactivate a
gene, depending on the system of enhancers and inhibitors, and depending on their
location in the imprint control regions (ICRs). This induces syndromes such as
Beckwith Wiedeman syndrome, Prader Willi or Angelman syndromes.</p>

<p><span>In DNA, there
are also <b>intergenic regions</b><b> </b>and<b> </b><b>repetitive elements</b>. These are
usually methylated (cf. fig.1). Indeed, they have to be silenced in order to
keep genomic integrity. These regions are not supposed to be expressed, because
they are mutagenic (can induce deletion, insertion, reciprocal translocations).</span></p>

<p>In cancer, DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted.
Besides, they are hypomethylated, at genome-wide, increasing genomic
instability. So, for example transposition, activation and recombination
between repeats are induced, as activation of cryptic promoters and disruption
to neighboring genes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, disrupted DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes
to disease by increasing the number of mutations through chromosomal instability.</p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jz188waiz9qvfr3/Schematic%20figure%20of%20DNA%20methylation%20in%20normal%20cell%20compared%20to%20cancer%20cell.jpg" title="Link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jz188waiz9qvfr3/Schematic%20figure%20of%20DNA%20methylation%20in%20normal%20cell%20compared%20to%20cancer%20cell.jpg">https://www.dropbox.com/s/jz188waiz9qvfr3/Schematic%20figure%20of%20DNA%20methylation%20in%20normal%20cell%20compared%20to%20cancer%20cell.jpg</a>  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Disruption
of imprinting</b> can contribute to cancer. <br />For example, in H19/Igf2 cluster (chromosome11 in human), at the paternal allele, methylation of H19 gene (and so its inactivation) is spread downstream to the Imprinted Control Region (ICR), thus allowing enhancers to activate the Igf2 gene (growth promoting gene). (fig.2).</p><p>On the maternal
allele, CTCF, an insulator
protein, binds to the ICR, preventing it from methylation. Besides ICR will be unmethylated and so does H19. So, enhancers can activate the unmethylated H19 and won't access anymore Igf2. In this case, Ifg2 is inactive (fig.2).</p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmw32z4w1dc6z5c/H19_Igf2%20cluster%20in%20paternal%20and%20maternal%20alleles.jpg" title="Link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmw32z4w1dc6z5c/H19_Igf2%20cluster%20in%20paternal%20and%20maternal%20alleles.jpg">https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmw32z4w1dc6z5c/H19_Igf2%20cluster%20in%20paternal%20and%20maternal%20alleles.jpg</a> <br /></p><p><span><span>

</span></p><p><u>Fig.2</u> : H19/Igf2 cluster in paternal and
maternal alleles (link)</p><p>Finally, disrupting
imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease. For instance, Wilm’s tumour (cancer of kidney), deals with disrupted imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster. It's caused by hypermethylation of ICR that provokes Igf2 over-expression. So, both paternal and maternal allele are expressed (fig.3)<br />Imprinted disorder
can induce the loss of a tumour suppressor gene (Cdkn1c) or the upregulation of
Igf2 which means upregulation of this growth promoting gene. And so maternal
allele may behave like paternal allele, and contribute to disease.</p><p> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/j9qvxlhosyhmi5j/Schematic%20figure%20of%20H19_Igf2%20cluster%20in%20normal%20cell%20compared%20to%20Wilm%27s%20tumour%20cell.jpg">https://www.dropbox.com/s/j9qvxlhosyhmi5j/Schematic%20figure%20of%20H19_Igf2%20cluster%20in%20normal%20cell%20compared%20to%20Wilm%27s%20tumour%20cell.jpg</a> </p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><b></b>In the article
“<i>Cancer's epicentre</i>”
in The Economist are described several drugs that can affect epigenetic
processes, such as <b>Decitabine</b>.
Indeed, Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent; it is an inhibitor of DNA
methyltransferases (which catalyzes the transfer of methyl group on DNA).</span></p>

<p>As we previously described, DNA methylation is an inactive epigenetic mark. So Decitabine inhibits
DNA methyltransferases, working like a reaction inhibitor (as a chemical
analogue of the Cytosine) so that the enzyme (the DNA methyltransferase) binds
to it instead of normally binding to the C nucleotides of DNA. In this way, Decitabine decreases the transfer of methyl group on DNA.</p>

<p>Furthermore,
Decitabine removes methylation, like on CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes, in cancer. So with this drug, we are now able to treat
myelodysplastic syndromes. <br />In some people, by using a combination of a
histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine, the tumour growth slowed in
advanced lung cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some drugs can alter DNA methylation and have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment. Indeed, altering DNA
methylation can be mitotically heritable so that the next generations can inherit these alterations.<br />In development and lifetime, there are periods called sensitive periods. A sensitive period is
a period where the epigenome is unstable, when epigenetic marks are actively
remodeled. There are globally several ones.The first one is the primordial germ cell
development (for production of matures gametes). Oocytes remain vulnerable during childhood in females, as epigenetic marks are not established in oocytes until puberty. The other ones are pre-implantation and
early post-implantation.<br />Moreover the environment
can trigger somatic changes in DNA methylation in adults. However, treating patients
during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it would be a danger to
the offspring. <br />If a patient is
treated with drugs such as Decitabine during sensitive periods, the primordial
germ cells can be affected, so it would be transmitted to the next generation. This may induce a loss of a gene expression or its over-expression.</p></div>
