    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are often found at gene promoters. CpG islands tend not to be methylated although if there is DNA methylation at CpG islands, this causes the silencing of the gene. In cancer cells, there tends to be hypermthylation of CpG islands causing an increase in the silencing of genes. This locus specific hypermethylation has a negative consequence. For some cancers, they are described as having CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). There is also often an increase in the methylation of the CpG island shores and this can also be used as a clinical marker and may be a more accurate or earlier way of identifying cancerous cells. Changes to DNA methylation at CpG islands can causes cancers by silencing tumour suppressor genes. <br />At intergenic regions and repetitive elements, there is usually DNA methylation. This is to silence these areas. Silencing these areas increases genomic stability. Compacting these areas of DNA into heterochromatin reduces the chances of reciprocal translocations, deletions and insertions. It also silences cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites. Silencing repetitive elements prevents transpositions. In cancer, the DNA methylation is disrupted in that there is widespread hypomethylation. This leads to expression of intergenic regions which can interfere with protein expression by interrupting correct gene expression by anti-sense gene expression from intergenic regions. Repetitive elements will be able to transpose themselves and interrupt exons; if they are changed to euchromatin, they may be able to pair with incorrect chromosomes and cause translocations; these all have mutagenic consequences for the cell. <br />Levels of DNA hypermethylation and genomic DNA hypomethylation vary between cancer types - some cancers are likely to be driven by hypermethylation and some by hypomethylation although this may vary throughout the development and life of the cancer cells. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors that causes DNA demethylation.  This drug is a nucleoside analogue - it gets incorporated in the DNA after replication and it irreversible binds the DNMTs. When the DNMTs is bound, it will no longer be able to methylate DNA. This could reduce DNA hypermethylation in CpG islands or shores, This helps because it is replication driven - cancer cells tend to be replicating very quickly or frequently which means the drug will affect them more. Reducing DNA methylation will help treat cancers which are primarily driven by the hypermethylation of CpG islands in tumour suppressing genes for example this drug can currently to be used to help to treat myelodysplastic syndrome which is believed to be caused by hypermethylation of CpG islands in tumour suppressing genes. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">One of the hallmarks of epigenetics is that they are mitotically heritable. DNA methylation is a epigenetic modification. Therefore, any alteration to DNA methylation will be inherited by daughter cells. If a drug is used to adjust DNA methylation, either hypomethylation or hypermethylation, this will be inherited and therefore will have an enduring effect on the genome of any cells affected by the drug. A sensitive period is a period during the development of a cell where epigenetic marks are being reprogrammed - these times are to ensure inherited totipotency. These are two occasions - one; during the initial development of an embryo (from zygote to blastocyst stage[pre-implantation development]) and two; during the development of primordial germ cells. If a patient is treated during a sensitive period, it will alter the development of either a zygote or, more likely, primordial germ cells. This may result in aberrant epigenetic marks being inherited from germ cells by further generations for example in imprinted genes. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation pattern of the paternal allele is for methylation and the maternal allele is unmethylated. When the imprint control region is unmethylated as it is in the mother's allele, it is bound by a protein called CTCF. This insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. These enhancers are able to then increase expression of the long noncoding RNA H19 from the mother's allele instead of Igf2. In the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated and CTCF can't bind to it. This means that Igf2 can be expressed from the paternal allele as the downstream enhancers will preferrentially act on Igf2. Igf2 is only expressed from the paternal allele. In a Wilms tumour, there is a disruption to genomic imprinting and there is biallelic expression from both maternal and paternal allele. This is also related to the genetic condition Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. This loss of imprinting leads to overexpression of Igf2 which is a growth hormone and leads to overgrowth in some somatic cells. This stimulates the growth of cancer cells and prevents damaged cells from being destroyed. <br /></div>
