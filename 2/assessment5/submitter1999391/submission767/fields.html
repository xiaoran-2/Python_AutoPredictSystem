    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands tend to remain unmethylated. Methylation of CpG islands at promoters of genes leads to their silencing. In case of cancer cells, the CpG islands in the promoter regions of the tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated. This leads to the silencing of these tumor suppressor genes. The cells then start to divide more rapidly and don't die as fast. <br /><br />In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are heavily methylated. Thus these regions are silent in normal cells and the DNA methylation marks help maintain genomic stability. In cancer cells, the intergenic and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This leads to illegitimate combination of repeats, reciprocal translocations and genomic instability in general.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele imprint control region(ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated. the methylation spreads to the H19 gene which is then silenced. CTCF(an insulator protein) cannot bind to the methylated ICR and the enhancers downstream to H19 are free to act on the Igf2 gene and promote its expression. <br /><br />On the maternal allele, the  imprint control region(ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluste is unmethylated and CTCF binds to it. This insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers, while the H19 gene is expressed. Igf2 is hence not expressed.<br />Thus in normal cells Igf2, which is growth promoting, is expressed only on the paternal allele and is paternally imprinted.<br /><br />In the case of Wilm's tumor, there is a loss of imprinting in the cells. The ICR of the maternal allele is hypermethylated. This leads to enhancement in the expression of Igf2(two copies are being expressed, maternal and paternal). As Igf2 is a growth promoter, overexpression of it leads to enhanced growth, which finally leads to tumor formation. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyl transfetase inhibitor(DNMTi) or a DNA demethylating agent. It is a drug that targets enzymatic epigenetic regulators(DNMT in this case). In cancer cells, the tumor suppressor gene promoters are hypermethylated. A dosage of Decitabine leads to DNA demethylation.<br /><br />Similar to azacitidine, Decitabine gets incorporated into DNA. During cell division, when DNA Methyl Transferase(DNMT) arrives to copy the DNA methylation mark onto the daughter strand, it binds to Decitabine irreversibly. Thus the DNA methylation mark is not carried over to the daughter strand. The action of Decitabine is cell division dependent. Since cancer cells divide much faster than normal cells and hence are more severely affected by DNMTis. Demethylation of the promoter may activate tumor suppressors, leading to an anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a mitiotically heritable epigenetic mark. Once the DNA methylation state has been altered, every time DNA replicates, this epigenetic state is passed on to the daughter strand by the effect of DNA methyl transferases(DNMTs). DNMT1 has a preference for hemimethylated DNA and methylates cytosine on the unmethylated, newly synthesized daughter strand at corresponding regions. <br /><br />Sensitive periods are those stages in the lifetime of an individual when genome wide epigenetic reprogramming takes place. These are mainly the pre-implantation period and the period of primordial germ cell development. DNA methylation marks are cleared up and re-established during these periods. During primordial germ cell development this is done in a parent-of-origin specific fashion. <br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods, such as treating boys of the age 9-12 years with drugs that affect DNA methylation may affect the primordial germ cell development and the establishment of the imprint marks(paternal in this case) in ways we cannot fathom. </div>
