    <div class="field-value">DNA methilation is a way of silencing gene expression epigenetically. In mammals, this happens mostly on cytosines preceding guanine (CpG islands). CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. DNA methilation at CpG islands is essential for a number of functions in mammals, such as embryogenesis and development. <br />In normal cells, cpg islands are dense and unmethylated.<br />In cancer, as we progress from normal tissue to metastatic tissue the global level of methylated cytosine (5mC) decreases and at the same time methylation at CpG islands becomes more dense and hypermethylated. If the DNA at the promoter becomes hypermethylated, the tumour supressor is switched off and so the gene becomes inactivated resulting in proliferation of malignant cells.    <br /><br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are required to silence their expression as their replication and insertion can lead to gene disruption and DNA mutation.<br />The increase in DNA methylation at specific sites, like cpg islands, is often accompained by a decrease of dna methylation in other areas of the genome, like intergenic regions and repetitive elements, possibly caused by genomic instability and/or a fall in expression of dna methyltransferase, dnmt1. The decrease in global dna methylation may contribute to the development of cancer. The consequence of genome-wide hypomethylation depends on where it occurs. It can occur on repeats or intergenic regions due to genomic instability (with illegitimate recombination of repeats, activaction of repeats and/or activaction of promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes) or it can occur at cpg poor promoters with activation of an oncogene. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting refers to a expression of only one pair of alleles either maternal or paternal. DNA methylation switches genes off and therefore it plays a role on which genes of the paternally-inherited region of a chromossome are methylated or unmethylated. Methylation of the Imprinting Control Regions (ICR) depends on their mode of action. <br />On the H19/Igf2 cluster, found on chromossome 11, the ICR on the paternal allele is usually methylated and the H19 gene is inactivated. The enhancers can access Igf2 and Igf2 is expressed. On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and an insulator protein (CTCF) binds to the ICR, blocking it. The enhancers now don't act on the Igf2 protein but on the H19 gene, expressing it. <br />When imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster goes wrong resulting in both genes on chromossome 11 being switched on (so maternal allele behaving like paternal allele) leads to Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome with a predisposition for childhood tumour. e.g. Wilm's tumour. By expressing twice as much Igf2 protein as normal, this overexpression of growth promoting genes results in the overgrowth of the foetus, macroplasia and childhood tumours.<br />Loss of imprinting is a common feature and a hallmark of cancer.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (tradename Dacogen) is a <span>DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, licensed for clinical use in cancer by FDA in the USA. Decitabine is most effective against haematological tumours like myelodysplastic syndrome.  <br />The DNMTi (decitabine) gets incorporated into DNA upon replication and RNA transcription, in much smaller doses than previously used in the 70's, and then the DNMT1 comes along to bind the DNMTi irreversibly, then copies the DNA methylation to the daughter strand. The incorporation into DNA and RNA inhibits DNA methyltransferase resulting in unmethylation in that sequence. The action of DNMT inhibitors is division dependent which means that cells that divide more rapidly than others, like cancer cells will be more effectively targeted. </span><span>This affects the way that cell regulatory proteins are able to bind to the </span>DNA/RNA<span>substrate.<br /></span>Decitabine seems to work in the same way as 5-azacytidine <span>and to perform an anti-neoplastic effect at low doses.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">If we could reverse the epigenetic changes by using drugs that chemically bind specifically to epigenetic modifiers and inhibit their function which are then passed on during cell division to daughter cells and erase the gene regulation, we could potencially help treat cancer.<br />Sensitive periods are periods when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control because of active remodelling of epigenome. There are two major periods. One being from the primordial germ cell development through to the production of mature eggs and sperm. And the second being the pre-implantation and early post-implantation. <br />Treating patients during these sensitive periods when epigenetic marks are actively remodelled would have the greatest effect on epigenetic control as these are crucial periods of development and also because these epigenetic marks would be transmitted from parent to offspring through the germ cells.   </div>
