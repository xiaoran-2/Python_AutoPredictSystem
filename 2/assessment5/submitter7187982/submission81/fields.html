    <div class="field-value"><b>Under normal conditions</b>, DNA methylation of the promoter regions is accompanied with decrease in the gene expression , so its important in many epigenetic mechanisms as (X inactivation, formation of hetero-chromatin,..) , with the exception of  CpG Islands which are usually hypomethylated, on  the other hand , Intergenic region and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells  which keep the DNA densely packed causing genomic stability and decrease incidence of abnormal karyotype. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and can pass to the subsequent generation , so its known to be the most solid epigenetic mark, apart from DNA methylation reprogramming which only occurs during gametogensis and fertilization) <br /><b>In case of Cancer,</b> the whole mechanism is reversed in which CpG islands are tend to be hypermethylated , hypermethylation at the promoter region of CpG island will cause silencing of Tumour suppressor genes causing cancer "this mechanism occurs frequently than mutations" ,here DNA hypermethylation progress with time and with increasing age,  <em>hypermethyaltion examples</em>: RB in retinoblastoma "double hit hypothesis" , BRCA1 in Breast cancer,  also CpG islands of a set of genes can be methylated "CIMP" and cause many types of cancer including colorectal cancer and gliomas, another mechanism of hypermethylation of CpG island "shores" which lie 2kb from the CpG island .<br /><b>also in cancer,</b> there is hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intragenic regions leading to open chromatin and activation of repeats which eventually cause illegitimate recombination and misalignment , this mechanism cause genomic instability in the form of deletions , insertions and reciprocal trans locations. <em>examples of hypomethylation which cause genomic instability</em>  : deletion of Dnmt1 , mutations in Dnmt3B .<br />finally hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can result in activation of genes like RAS gene activation which is an known  "oncogene"  leading to pathogenesis of many hematological malignancies as well as gastric cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 cluster are normally controlled by enhancer blocking insulator protein named (CTCF) , <strong><em>on the Maternal allele :</em></strong> CTCF is activated so the enhancer will activate H19 but cant reach Igf2 , so Igf2 will be methylated , <strong><em>on the Paternal allele :</em></strong> CTCF is down-regulated "hypermethylated" , and H19 is methyalted so the enhancer protein will activate Igf2 gene ,<strong> net result:</strong> <strong><em>Maternal allele:</em></strong> methylated Igf2 ,expressed H19,<strong><em> Paternal allele</em></strong>: methylated H19 and expressed Igf2.<br /><strong>In case of Wilm's tumor:</strong> there is overexpression of Igf2 gene on the maternal allele ,meaning that the maternal allele will behave like the paternal allele causing what is so called "unipaternal disomy" , in which there will be 2 copies of the paternal chromosome ,this occurs due to hypermethylation of CTCF or an  abnormality (mutation or deletion) in linked kcnq1 and H19/Igf2 clusters , causing loss of function of CDKN1A gene (tumor suppressor gene) and up regulation of Igf2 gene <br /><strong>In cancer</strong>: there is "loss of imprinting" , which means there is either bi-allelic expression or bi-allelic repression , which can result from hyper/hypomethylation , loss of imprinting will result in activation of an oncogene or inactivation of tumour supressor gene (see the previous example in wilm's tumor).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>Decitabine,</b> is a drug which belongs to Dnmt1 inhibitors as "DNA de-methylating agent", its now in the market as it FDA approved ,Its mode of action is still unclear, but its thought to bind Dnmt1 after being incorporated into the DNA and become integrated through out the cell division  , mainly targeting the rapidly dividing cells (cancer cells) ,causing DNA  (de)-hypomethylation  , and therefore  activating tumor suppressor genes at the checkpoints of the cell cycle to cause DNA repair , or cellular apoptosis to the irreversible DNA damage,limiting the progression of cancer,  it used in the treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Acute Myeloid leukemia as they are mainly due to hypermethyaltion at the promoter regions of the tumor suppressor genes., Decitabine is used in small doses in order to give maximum anti-neoplastic effect without acting non specifically (can affect both cancer and normal cells) or causing any toxicity.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since Epigenetic alterations are reversible and can be easily diagnosed unlike genetic mutations which cause irreversible damage , Drugs targeting the "enzymatic epigenetic regulators" are now used, e.g: <b>DNMT1i</b> as 5' azacitidine,decitibine,vidaza , which <i><b>irreversibly</b></i> binds to Dnmt1 and became consolidated  in DNA making their effect last beyond the period of drug treatment as they are "division dependent" causing epigenetic changes which will be passed on to the future generations and also they act none specifically , enduring their effect on normal cells as well. <br /> Non specific drugs are inadvisable during sensitive periods , as sensitive periods are periods when altered environment can have an effect on the epigenetic control, (induced by diet, maternal care, or chemical exposure "drugs").<br />here the most sensitive periods affected by drug intake are during germ cell development and gametogenesis , where there is tissue specific differentiation and the epigenetic marks are removed and reset, so altered DNA methylation during these periods may disrupt the epigenetic make- up , thus younger patients may be at higher risk from these non specific drugs.<br /></div>
