    <h1>Submission 890 from Anon (session_user_id: e508321c92519929cf30f392e281573e53c6362b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent that can inhibit methylation, resulting in the expression of the previously hypermethylated silenced genes. This hypomethylating agent inhibit DNA methyltransferase.<br />Epimutations are reversible, unlike mutations. That means we should be able in some cases to remove them using specific compounds. When epigenetic changes are erased, they cannot return. Therefore, epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. <br /></span><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is essential for normal development and is associated with a number of key processes. DNA methylation may affect the transcription of genes in two ways. First, the methylation of DNA itself may physically impede the binding of transcriptional proteins to the gene and second, and likely more important, methylated DNA may be bound by proteins know and methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins. <br />In cancer, aberrant DNA methylation patterns - hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue - have been associated with a large number of human malignancies. <span>Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation.<br /></span>In normal cells, we can observe that in intergenic regions and repetitive elements methyletion occurs more likely in comparison to cancer cells. In cancer cells these regions can contain hypomethylated sequences. Hypomethylations occur most commonly at repeats. Genome-wide hypomethylation occurs to some degree in all tested tumour types. Hypomethylation observed in cancer has consequences. They are depended on hypomethylations' location. Hypomethylation can cause genomic instability leading to cancers. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Lots of genes that are imprinted are involved in growth. Either they're growth supprting or growth suppressing. We are able to find in cancers either hyper or hypomethylated imprint control regions what depends on function of the particular gene. This events can occur very early in tumorogenesis.<br />In normal cells, Imprint control region in H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on paternal allele and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it's unmethylated, CTCF can bind its insulator element and enhancers will act on H19 but Igf2 will be silent and not expressed. When it's methylated, enhancers act on Igf2 and it is then expressed from the paternal allele. Loss of imprinting causes hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele. Therefore, we have a double dose of Igf2, which is a growth promoting gene, in comparison to normal cells. This is associated with Wilm's tumour. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The sensitive periods is the term used to describe important periods of childhood development. A sensitive period is a time especially devoted to the acquisition of a particular trait. Once that trait is acquired, the sensitivity disappears. We can describe the sensitive periods, arranging them on focus (language, order, sensory refinement, refinement of motor skills, sensitivity to small objects and social behavior). Treating younger patiens during sensitive periods should be taken under consideration because it may effect on germ cells.</div>
