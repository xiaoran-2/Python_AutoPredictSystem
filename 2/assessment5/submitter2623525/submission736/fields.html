    <div class="field-value">Cancer cells harbors an aberrant DNA methylation profile compared to healthy cells: hypermethylated CpG islands (CGIs) are prevalent in cancer cells while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. CGIs in promoter region confers transcriptional accessibility depending on their methylation status. In healthy tissues, CGIs are hypomethylated which grants transcription activation of the associated genes but in cancer cells CGIs are hepermethylated, leading to gene silencing. Generally CGIs of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) such as <i>TP53</i>, <i>RB </i>or <i>BRCA1</i> are most frequently hypermethylated in different form of cancer. Since these TSGs control cell growth and proliferation, there silencing allows cells to attain cancerous potency and burgeon subsequently towards metastasis state. On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in normal cells. Since they trigger different form of genomic instability such as recombination between long repeats and transposition, DNA methylation in these regions precludes their activity and safeguards genomic stability. Inversely, cancer cells tend to have hypomethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements which allows them to become transcriptionally active and ensue genomic instability, one of the fundamental cause of cancer progression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of imprinting is one of the key characteristics of cancer cells: in cancer, most of the imprinted genes are either silenced or expressed, biallelically. For example, in normal cells H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted. Imprint control region (ICR) of paternal H19/Igf2 locus is hypermethylated; therefore, the distal enhancer loops back to <i>Igf2 </i>and promotes its expression. In maternal H19/Igf2 allele, ICR is unmethylated and CTCF binds it. Hence the enhancer looping is confined to <i>H19</i> and allows its expression while <i>Igf2 </i>remains silence. In case of Wilm's tumour, maternal ICR of H19/Igf2 allele becomes hypermethylated similar to paternal allele and <em>Igf2</em> is expressed biallelically. As imprinting at <span>H19/Igf2 cluster ensures monoallelic</span> expression of oncogene <i>Igf2,</i> perturbation of this imprinting elevates <em>Igf2</em> expression and spur tumorigenicity and cancer.<p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine</span> is a FDA approved DNMT inhibitor that has been used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. Like other DNMTi, decitabine is a base analogue which is incorporated into DNA strands during replication. Later, decitabine irreversibly binds to DNMTs and precludes subsequent DNA methylation. As genome wide aberrant DNA methylaion specially in CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes is the basis of tumorigenicity, optimum decitabine dose can substantially abate DNMT dependent DNA methylation in tumor cells. This will ultimately impair tumor cells to proliferate and maintain cancerous property in subsequent generation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable epigenetic mark that is successfully passed down to dividing cells. Therefore epigenetic drug induced altered DNA methylation profile of tumour cells will continue to persist in the accompanying daughter cell's epigenomes long after treatment period.<br />In development, sensitive period is the phase when genome and epigenome of an organism undergoes large scale reorganization and reconstitution. Early embryonic development and germ cell development are the most sensitive periods of development.<br />Since sensitive periods such as pregnancy and puberty, epigenome undergoes rapid reprogramming and is most vulnerable to physiological and environmental influence, treating patient during this period with epigenetic drugs might induce aberrant epigentic programming which will pass down to future generation through germ line. Therefore, such sensitive period must be avoided for patient treatment.</div>
