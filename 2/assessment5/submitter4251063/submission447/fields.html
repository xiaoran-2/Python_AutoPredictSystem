</p><p>DNA methylation disruption is associated with cancer specially
in CpG islands and CpG island shores, which usually remain unmethylated in
normal cells. Cancer cells, also show a global low level of methylation which
represent the absence of epigenetic marks in some areas where methylation is a
control mechanism, global hypomethylation triggers genomic instability and
aberrant TIS</p><p>

</p><p>1-Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands. DNA methylation
is  a 'silencing' epigenetic mark, and CpG islands are transcription
regulatory regions, if the CpG island associated with the expression of a
particular gene is methylated, this situation would lead to the silencing of
that gene. </p><p>

</p><p>2-DNA methylation of CpG islands disruption in cancer. Cancer
cells tend to show hyper methylation of CpG regions associated with the
expression of tumor suppressor genes and also global Hypo methylation in other
regions that normally require methylation for transcription control.</p><p>

</p><p><span> 3-Effect of disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands
on Cancer cells.  The methylation of CpG island that silence tumor
suppressor genes would enable growth of tumor tissue that otherwise would be
subject to controlling action of enzymes and growth inhibition factors normally
produce by tumor suppression genes. Additionally the lack of methylation of
other regions that normally are methylated tends to lead to the activation of
oncogenes and the occurrence of transcription at abnormal sites creating 
genetic instability.</span></p><p>

</p><p><span> 4-The Function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions
and repetitive elements is believed to be related with reducing the risk of
transcription of harmful sequences.</span></p><p>

</p><p><span> 5- DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive
elements is disrupted in cancer because the methylation that normally exist in
these regions is removed</span></p><p>

</p><p><span> 6-Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and
repetitive elements contributes to cancer by enabling the activation of
transposons and repetitive elements that create genetic instability.</span></p><p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hyper-methylation of Imprinting Control Regions ICR is associated with loss of imprinting, meaning that genes that should display mono allele parent of origin specific expression become expressed from both parents or silenced from both parents, as many of the imprinted genes are related with growth promotion or suppression, this type of abnormality easily lead to tumors development.</p><p>In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster,</p><p>The maternal allele normally will be un-methylated at the ICR, and should not express Igf2,  if the ICR is methylated then Igf2 will be expressed.</p><p>The paternal allele normally will be methylated at the ICR and should express the Igf2 which is the imprinted allele</p><p>When Igf2 is expresses from both parents, this overexpression will lead to the development of the Wilm´s kidney tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells, show an abnormally high level of methylation of CpG island, histone modifications,  translocations, amplification or point mutations, all those conditions are produced by failures in the epigenetic machinery and generally leads to the disruption of the normal expression of genes required for fully normal cells. </p><p>The hyper methylation of CpG islands is associated with the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, therefore a drug that inhibit the methylation of CpG island should avoid the silencing of the tumor suppressor genes associated with that region.</p><p>1-Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating 
agent, it </span> hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. </p><p>2-Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation alone the cellular genome, but particularly important on CpG island that control expression of tumor suppressors genes 
</p>

<p>3-Decitabine anti-tumor effect is most likely related to
its effect in enabling the expression of tumor suppressor genes that would be
silence if the methylation of their control region is not removed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>With some exceptions, many epigenetic marks are erase and reset during early development of the embryo and during primordial germ cell development, nevertheless it is also known that changes introduced in the epigenetic setting in early life can have life long lasting effects by mitotically heritage.</p><p>A possible mechanism to support Dr.Baylin speculation, is assuming that the abnormal patterns of cell division in tumor tissue is susceptible to accommodate changes in the epigenetic setting that can be heritable by mitosis.</p><p>The sensitive periods are those when epigenetic marks can be reset, which are restricted to blastocyst stage and later on during germ cells development, this makes treatment impractical and open to unknown side effects.</p><p><br /></p></div>
