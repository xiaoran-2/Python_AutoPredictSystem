    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In general, DNA methylation plays a role as a switching of gene expression; DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands inactivate the gene expression and DNA hypomethylation at CpG island activate the gene expression. In normal cell, the majority of CpG island are hypomethylated. However, in cancer cell, DNA hypermethylation occurs at CpG island. It causes silence of tumor suppressor gene and contributes to cancer development. <br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contribute to genome stability. In normal cell, these region generally hypermethylated. However, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancer cell. It causes genome instability such as chromosome transposition and activates oncogene. The activation of oncogene contributes to cancer development.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal status, Igf2 is expressed only in paternal allele, not in maternal allele.Imprinting control region is hypermethylated in paternal allele, but not in maternal allele. <br />In paternal allele, Enhancer downstreams can enhance Igf2 because insulator cannot bind hypermethylated imprinting control region. Therefore, paternal allele expresses Igf2 gene. <br />On the other hand, unmethylated imprinting control region can bind insulator called CTCF in maternal allele. Enhancer downstream can enhance H19, but not enhance Igf2 because of insulator. <br />In Wilm's tumor, imprinting control region in maternal allele is hypermethylated. CTCF cannot bind this region. Therefore, enhancer can activate the expression of Igf2 in maternal allele. As result, the expression Igf2 is doubled compared to normal cell. Igf2 works growth promoting and it causes Wilm's tumor.<br />  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is classified as a DNA-demethylating agent. Dcitabine demethylate the promotor of tumor suppressor gene. It results in the activation of tumor suppressor gene and shows anti-tumor effect. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation are passed during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells. Therefore, once drugs alter DNA methylation, the effects last long time. Sensitive period can be defined as a term which outside agents can affect epigenetic status. sensitive period is generally in early development phase. Patients should avoid receiving chemotherapy during sensitive period because drugs can affect the epigenetic status not only cancer cell, but also normal cell including germ cell; it might cause some adverse effects including anomaly birth or miscarriage.  </div>
