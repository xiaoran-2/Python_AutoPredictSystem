    <div class="field-value">The DNA methylation at CpG islands causes silencing of Gene expression. The primary mechanism for gene silencing is through the binding of MeCP proteins to CpG islands. When bound to CpG islands, MeCP's repress transcription since they have a transcriptional repression domain. They can also attract other factors to condense chromatin and make genes not accessible. The second mechanism is to prevent transcription factor binding. DNA methylation is laid down by DNMT3a and DNMT3b in mammals and Hemi-methylated DNA is maintained  by Dnmt1.<br /><br />Cancer cells typically show DNA hypermethylation at a specific locus (CpG island) which silences tumor suppressor genes. This hypermethylation is mitotically heritable thus maintained through cell division. The epimutations are rapidly selected in the surrounding tissue since cancer cells typically live longer and divide faster. Certain cancers  like colorectal cancer show hypermethylation in CpG islands of a set of genes. Recent discovers have shown hypermethylation at CpG island spreads to the shores (2000 bases neighboring CpG islands)  in cancer cells.<br /><br />The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. This methylation is important in maintaining genomic stability. Experiments have shown that cells without Dnmt1 display genomic instability. The DNA methylation  at the repetitive elements,  silences the repeats to prevent transposition and avoid interference from strong promoters, and may prevent illegitimate recombination. <br /><br />In cancer cells, there is a genomic wide lack of methylation. The  hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic intervals  causes genomic instabilities like  illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. Genomic instability increases the likelihood of 
particular mutations  that activate oncogenes and inactivate 
tumor suppressor genes, leading to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region (ICR) is methylated in the paternal allele. This methylation blocks binding of CTFC protein to paternal allele. The methylation at ICR further spreads to neighboring H19 promoter and silences it. This allows the enhancers to activate Igf2 and promote Igf2 expression from paternal allele. The ICR in maternal allele is not methylated allowing the CTFC protein to bind to ICR region. This insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Enhancers work on H19 instead of Igf2. Thus,  Igf2 in the maternal allele is silenced.<br />In case of Wilm's tumor, imprinting is lost and  both parental alleles are hypermethylated. This results in over expression of Igf2. That is a double dose of Igf2 compared to normal cell. Igf2 is growth promoting and this over expression is associated with Wilm's tumor. This also reduces the expression of H19. H19 normally restrains growth. The increased Igf2 can simulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent them from being destroyed. Loss of impring at IGF2 has been observed in many cancers including Wilm's tumor which is a form of tumor cancer. The loss of imprinting is an early event in tumorigenesis. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine  is a hypomethylating agent. This is done by inhibiting DNMT . Decitabine is chemically similar to cytidine.  It is incorporated into DNA upon replication. When DNMT1 comes to bind the particular nucleotide (Decitabine)  to add methylation to daughter cells, it is permanently bound and never released. The lack of DNMT1 in the cell causes DNA demethylation. Cancer cells which duplicate more rapidly compared to other cells in the body are more severely affected. Cancer cells are demethylated faster than other cells. The effects on normal dividing cells are not very well understood. There may be other mechanisms involved  in addition to demethylation but they are not very well understood at this time.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic drugs change epigenetic markers on cancer cells (e.g. methylation). These changes are   mitotically heritable and passed to daughter cancer cells as the cancer cells divide. Once the epigenome of cancers cells are changed, it can potentially cause the shut down some oncogene, suppress growth, or make cancer cells more susceptible to chemotherapy. The molecular mechanism of how this happens are not very well understood at this point.<br />Sensitive periods in human development are when active remodeling of epigenome happens. One such period is the<br />primordial germ cell development to production of mature eggs and sperms. The second sensitive period starts around preimplantation and includes early post implantation. Treating a person during her/his sensitive periods, when their epigenome is reprogrammed, can permanently damage their own epigenome markers, or their future generation.  The best time to use epigenetic drugs are when epigenome is stable.<br /><br /></div>
