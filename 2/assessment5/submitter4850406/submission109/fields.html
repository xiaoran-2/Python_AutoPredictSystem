    <h1>Submission 109 from Anon (session_user_id: 1dd826ed3defd1f932ba5e1bc2858b4a85446942)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitadine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which is the precursor to acute myelogenous leukaemia. It acts by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases that would lead to increased methylation of tumor-suppressor genes; or in other words, Decitabine helps to keep tumor-suppressor genes hypomethylated and allows restoration of their normal function and control over cell growth.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetics changes may have a transgenerational effect (e.g., nutritional supplementation and epigenetic changes in the transmission of <i>Agouti viable yellow</i> allele in mice). The drugs administered by Dr. Baylin's group may have caused epigenetic changes in the tumor cells that were passed on the next generations of tumor cells, until they were actively eliminated or became more susceptible to chemotherapy.<br /><br />In epigenetics, sensitive period is a time during development where epigenetic reprogramming occurs, and environmental signals may alter or influence epigenetic changes that can have long lasting effects in the organism's life and its offspring. Examples include <i>in vitro</i> culture, effects of hormones and nutrition <i>in utero</i> (pregnancy), celullar reprogramming, germ cell exposure, etc.<br /><br />Treatment of patients during sensitive periods is not advisable because it may interfere with epigenetic reprogramming that may negatively affect one's offspring.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are normally hypomethylated (which allows genes to be expressed) and intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements are hypermethylated and transcriptionally inactive in normal cells. Imprinting mechanisms that lead to uniparental allele expression, X inactivation and formation of heterochromatin are also controlled by parent-specific methylation patterns in normal cells. <br /><br />In cancer cells, local or genome-wide changes in methylation patterns can lead to genome instability by silencing of active genes due to hypermethylation and activation of silent genes that are usually hypermethylated and activation of transposable elements normally silenced by epigenetics mark, and chromatim remodelling. For example, tumor-suppressing genes are usually related to cell growth and active in early cell development. Methylation of CpG islands of these genes will silence them and allow mature cells to function normally; changes on CpG islands from a hypermethylated state to a hypomethylated state may awake tumor-suppressing genes and lead to uncontrolled cell growth and development of tumor cells that outcompete and overcome normal cells. Similarly, methylation of transcriptionally-silent genomic areas such as repetitive elements and intergenic regions make then easily recognized from chromatin condensation (heterochromatin). Changes in heterochromatic state may lead to chromosomal changes (deletions, insertions, translocation, duplications, activation of transposable elements that may move and disrupt other genomic areas) that also can cause genomic instability and uncontrolled cell growth.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, parental methylation patterns of the ICR (Imprinting Control Region) dictates whether H19 (a long noncoding RNA gene) or igf2 (Insulin growth factor 2) gene is expressed. The paternal allele is methylated at the ICR and downstream at the promoter of H19, making H19 to be not expressed; downstream enhancers in turn activate the transcription of Igf2 located upstream of the methylated ICR. The maternal allele is unmethylated at the ICR, which allows the CTCF protein to bind to the ICR; CTCF acts as an insulator that prevents expression of the maternal Igf2 allele and facilitates the expression of maternal H19.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, loss of imprinting leads to overexpression of Igf2 (which then is expressed bi-allelically) and reduced expression of maternal H19. Igf2 promotes cell growth and its overexpression is associated with not only Wilm's tumor but also many other forms of cancer. It is unclear as yet if Igf2 or other factors are responsible for neoplastic transformation.<br /><br /></div>
