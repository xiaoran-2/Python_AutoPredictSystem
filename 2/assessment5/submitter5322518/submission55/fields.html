    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normal cells CpG islands tend not to be methylated, but in cancer they tend to be methylated. The normal function is to not suppress gene expression of the associated gene.  Methylation of the CpG island can be one of the "hits" described in Knudson's hypothesis on the road to cancer, which will be mitotically inherited and therefore sustained in generations of these cells. This hypermethylation of CpG islands can result in epigenetic silencing of a tumor suppressor gene, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer.<br /><br />Methylation is usually on in intergenic regions and therefore tends to silence repetitive elements. In cancer, this methylation tends to be removed, resulting in genomic instability. this can result in illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation of repeats and activation of cryptic promoters.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The ICR in the paternal case is methylated, allowing the enhancers to skip over the H19 gene and instead cause the Igf2 to be expressed. The ICR in the the maternal case is not methylated which allows CTCF to bind to it so  H19 gene is expressed and Igf2 is not expressed. In the case of Wilm's disease, the maternal ICR is also methylated causing the maternal Igf2 to also express, resulting in double the dosage. Since Igf2 is involved in cell growth, this can enable this hallmark of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. They become part of the DNA at sites where methylation is occurring. Then during replication the replication machinery cannot bind a methyl to the daughter strand, this effectively removing methylation during repetitive cell divisions. Since hypermethylation combined with mitotic inheritance is required as a hallmark of cancer, and cancer cells divide often. this drug can effect the cancer by removing this hallmark in cases of CpG is silencing a tumor suppressor.<br /><br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since DNA methylation is mitotically inherited, changes to it on a cell will be inherited on all cells derived from the changed cell. A sensitive period is a particular period when epigenetic marks are removed from the genome. The two sensitive periods are the pre-implantation period of early development of an embryo and during primordial germ cell development. since most of these epigenetic targeted drugs are not local, they could have adverse effects on the cells that have their epigenetic marks removed.</div>
