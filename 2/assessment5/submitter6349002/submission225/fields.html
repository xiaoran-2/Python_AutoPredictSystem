    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are usually unmethylated and they are <strong>found at the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes</strong> where transcription factors bind. CpG islands are unmethylated in normal cells but in cancer there is CpG islands <b>hypermethylation</b>. Hypermethylation at CpG islandds serves as a <strong>silencing </strong>mechanism directed towards <b>Tumor Suppressor Genes</b>. Methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements serves to <b>preserve genetic integrity</b> by preventing the occurrence of deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are found to be <b>hypomethylated</b><b>, </b>this will lead to <b>genomic instability </b>due to recombination between different chromosomes that would otherwise not happen which may lead to to activation of oncogenes and/or disruption of expression of normal genes<b>.</b><br /><div><div></div><br /></div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>On the paternal allele</strong> the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated, this will prevent CTCF from binding and the enhancers will act on Igf2 leading to it's expression. <strong>On the maternal allele</strong> the imprint control region (ICR) is not methylated, this will allow CTCF to bind and the enhancers will 
act on H19 instead of Igf2 thus preventing it's expression. In <strong>Wilm's tumor</strong> the ICR is methylated in <strong>both the maternal and the paternal</strong> allele. This increase in dosage will lead to the <strong>over-expression of Igf2</strong> (which is growth promoting) thus leading to the formation of a tumor in the kidneys of children.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (<strong>DNMTi</strong>) and so it leads to <strong>DNA demethylation</strong>. It is a nucleoside analogue and only works if the cell is replicating, the drug incorporates into the DNA and when the DNMT comes to copy the methylation for the parent strand to the daughter strand it is <strong>irreversibly bound to the DNA</strong>.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Epigenetic changes are inherited</strong> from the parent cell and are passed on 
to the daughter cell. In this sense, any changes made to a parent cell 
-by drug therapy for example- will be passed down to the next 
generations thus resulting in long lasting effects. The epigenome goes 
through periods during the development that are labeled as "sensitive 
periods" which means that<strong> in these periods of time the epigenome is 
being rewritten</strong> by erasing some of the epigenetic markers to lay down 
new ones. There are<strong> two sensitive periods</strong> during the human development. One is during the 
primordial germ cell development, the other one is during the early 
period of the embryo's development (specifically gastirulation). 
Treating patients with drugs that affect the epigenome in such period is
 inadvisable because the epigenome itself is being rewritten and <strong>any 
change made to it during this period will be long lasting</strong> and our fear 
is occurrence of faulty epigenetic reprogramming.<br /></div>
