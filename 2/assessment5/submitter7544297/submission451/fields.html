    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands in promoter region are rare, and usually
resistant to DNA methylation. However, once methylated, they would silence the regulating
genes. CpG islands in the promoter region of some tumor suppressor genes in
cancer cells tend to be hypermethylated, and hence the underlying genes would
be silenced. In a normal cell, intragenic methylation is far more common than
that occurs in promoter region, and it is usually found at repetitive elements
(e.g. remnants of retroviral insertion). It is speculated that the intragenic
methylation may repress alternative transcription start sites, regulate
replication pace and inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing. In
cancer cells, the overall methylation level decreases, especially in intragenic
regions and repetitive elements, and, hence, destabilizes the transcription and
chromosome and upregulates the overall transcription rate. The mechanism of destabilization
includes chromatin remodeling and activating the transposons. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>In
the example of H19/Igf2, both paternal and maternal alleles contain an
insulator protein binding site, ICR. In paternal allele, ICR is methylated and
unable to bind to the insulator protein, CTCF, and therefore, the enhancers
activate the transcription of Igf2 and block that of H19.  On the other hand, CTCF is recruited at the
ICR on the maternal allele due to demethylation, and the enhancers
preferentially activate the transcription of H19 instead. Taken together, in normal
cells, the maternal allele is silent for Igf2 transcription. In some cases of Wilm’s
tumour, the maternal ICR is also methylated, and therefore, the maternal
allele actually acts as a paternal allele and causes a double expression of Igf2 gene.
Overexpression of Igf2 gene elevates the expression of some oncogenes, such as Erk1 and 2, and further contributes
to the tumor overgrowth. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine
is a deoxycytidine analog, and is a DNA-demethylation agent. If the cancer is
driven by silencing of tumor suppressor genes, Decitabine can reverse the process
by demethylation on the CpG islands on the promoter region of those tumor suppressor genes, and hence, re-activate them. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, is usually mitotically inheritable, maintaining by enzymes (e.g. Dnmt1) that recognize
semi-methylated sites.  On the contrary, if
the allele is demethylated by chemicals, the effect can also be passed through
mitosis and have enduring effects on epigenome. Sensitive periods are the time
periods that epigenetic marks are reset. The first sensitive period is the
early development of a zygote and before the embryo is fully formed. The
second sensitive period is the late development stage of an embryo where the
epigenetic marks of the newly formed primordial germ cells are reprogrammed. In
female, the sensitive period may prolong into puberty since the primary oocytes
are not fully developed until then. Treating the patients in sensitive periods would disturb
the epigenetic marks being reprogrammed and would impair the development of either
the embryo or the gamete cells. </span></div>
