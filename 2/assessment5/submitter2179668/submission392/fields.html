    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The  normal lack of DNA methylation at CpG islands  allows the gene expression. In cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated, so silencing the tumor suppressor genes. <br />In the intergenic regions and repetitive elements the normal function of DNA methylation is to maintain the integrity of the genome, avoiding chromosome deletions, reciprocal translocations , insertions and mutagenic deletions. In cancer that methylation is disrupted, as hypomethylation, that (associate to the lack of densely packaged heterochromatin) conduce to illegitimate recombination between repeats and to general genomic instability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells the paternal allele has the imprint control region (ICR) methylated, so CTCF cannot bind its insulator element and the enhancers can act on Igf2 and express it.<br />In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and CTCF binds its insulator element.In this case the enhancers will act on H19, that can be expressed. Instead Igf2 will be silent.<br />With loss of imprinting we have hypermethylation also on the maternal allele, and so we have a double dose of Igf2 (paternal + maternal). The Igf2 is growth promoting (and associated with Wilm's tumor) contributing to cancer cells growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, sold as "Dacogen" by Esai, is a DNA-demethylating agent: It reduce the methylation of the DNA in situations in which an abnormal hypermethylation drives to silencing tumour-suppressor genes. Reducing the methylation it reduce the silencing and promote expression of tumour-suppressor genes. Decitabine can also lead to better reaction to chemotherapy.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome mainly if that occur during the sensitive periods of development.<br />A sensitive period is when there is an active remodelling of the epigenome, and when the epigenome is more sensitive to changes in the environment.<br />The sensitive periods of development are mainly two: first the primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperm, and second the pre-implantation period and early post-implantation period.<br />Trating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because can lead to collateral, uncontrolled and unwanted alterations of the epigenome. So is better avoid in the childhood, while is no inadvisable in elderly age.</div>
