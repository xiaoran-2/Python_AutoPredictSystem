    <div class="field-value">Methylated cytosines within CpG islands can be used to silence a wide range of genes within the genome, though most sites are unmethylated in a normal genome. Local chromatin structure, thus gene regulation is influenced by the methylation of CpG islands, which is necessary for normal functioning of and normal expression of genes by a particular celltype. In cancer this normal gene silencing goes awry, by hypermethylation of specific loci. Silencing tumour supressor genes, which play a role in preventing oncogenic behaviour of cells (eg. uncontrolled division), due to CpG island hypermethylation can function as a "hit" within the multiple hit theory of cancer progression because their tumour supression function is reduced or gone altogether. One important point is that result of methylation (or lack thereof) is context-dependent and doesn't always have the same outcome.<br />In normal cells intergenic regions/repetitive elements are hypermethylated, which makes the chromatin structure more dense and less available. The reason these regions and repeats are methylated is to maintain genomic stability by preventing several detrimental processes like repeat recombination (--&gt; chromosomal translocations), activations of cryptic promoters or disruption of neighbouring genes (--&gt; transcriptional errors), etc. In cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements are (genome-wide) hypomethylated. This results in illegimate recombination of repeats and thus translocation of (parts of) chromosomes. Repeats can also jump between one place to another in the genome and act as cryptic promoters or disrupt genes. A lack of silencing of tumour oncogens due to genomic-wide hypomethylation (resulting in oncogenic behaviour of the cell), can result in the progression to cancer. Also, CpG poor promoters can be hypomethylated which results in activation of certain genes (eg. A micro-RNA which targets a tumour supressor gene). As with the previous hypermethylation the role of methylation is context-dependent and doesn't always have the same outcome.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells the imprint control region (ICR) of the paternal allele is methylated. Because it is methylated the enhancers upstream will have an effect on the Igf2 gene instead of the H19 gene, which is also methylated. --&gt; Igf2 will be expressed.<br />In normal cells the ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated. Because it is unmethylated CTCF will bind the ICR and that means that the enhancers upstream will make the H19 gene express instead of Igf2 --&gt; No enhancing of Igf2 results in it being silent (no expression).<br />In Wilm's tumour there is a loss of imprinting because of hypermethylation of the ICR in both the paternal and maternal allele. The maternal allele thus acts just like the paternal allele --&gt; Both alleles express the Igf2 gene. This double dose of Igf2 results in more growth promoting behaviour (one of the hallmarks of cancer) of the cell and ultimately Wilm's tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a cytidinedeoxynucleoside-analog and functions as a hypomethylating (or: DNA demethylating) cytostatic agent to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (progressed to acute myelogenous leukaemia). Decitabine is fosforylated intracellularly to decitabinetriphosphate and gets incorporated into the DNA, in which it acts as a selective inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferase. This inhibiting leads to hypomethylation of the genepromoter and ultimately to the reactivation of tumour supressor genes. The reactivation of these tumour supressor genes results in a normalisation of cell differentiation and cell apoptosis, which play a role in preventing the onset and -in this case- progression of tumours.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In certain periods of development, mainly the germ cell development and the pre-implantation development, the DNA is very sensitive to enduring effects on the epigenome. This susceptibility sometimes results in unwanted epigenetic changes. Because this DNA methylation can be mitotically heritable the specific changes in DNA methylation can be seen throughout the organisms life, with possible detrimental effects. Treating patients with drugs that could interfere with normal DNA methylation within sensitive periods of development could instigate such negative changes in the epigenome which could stay in the organism for a lifetime. <br /></div>
