    <div class="field-value">In cancer two different phenomena affecting DNA methylation could be seen. The first one affects the methylation pattern of CpG islands in promoter genes. Usually, in normal cells, these CpG islands are unmethylated, allowing gene expression. However, in cancer these CpG islands are hypermethylated, and therefore silencing gene expresion. In cancer, these genes associated with hypermethylated CpG islands are supossed to be affecting to tumor supressor genes. However, not only the CpG islands could be affected by hypermethylation, surrounding 2Kb regions to both sides of a CpG island could be hypermethylated (the so colled CpG island shores). The hypermethylation of these CpG island shores has also been associated to gene expression. The other phenomenon affecting the normal methylation pattern in canceris referred to wide-genome hypomethylation: although specific regions (CpG islands and surrounding regions) could be hypermethylated, the genome of cancer cells is usually hypomethylated when compared with the genome of normal cells. In normal cells, intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements should be methylated. This methylation behaviour protects the integrity of the chromosomes avoiding illegitimate recombination between homologous regions in two different chromosomes. By contrast, in cancer cells, repetitive elements and intergenic regions are usually hypomethylated allowing different genomic abnormalities as deletions, insertions and/or reciprocal translocations between chromosomes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The expression level of Igf2 in normal cells is a consequence of the difference between the pattern of expression of the locus Igf2-H19 from the maternal or paternal alleles. In the maternal allelo, hypomethylation on specific regions of the H19 promoter allows the binding of CTCF to one of this regions, as well as hypomethylation of CpG islands at H19 promoters trigger this gene mediated to enhancers present in the locus. CTCF binding, as well as concomitantly expression of H19, avoid the expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele. However, from paternal allele, the CTCF binding region and the CpG island in H19 are methylated, and as a consequence H19 is not expressed, allowing that the enhancers trigger the expression of Igf2 in this paternal allelo. In Wilm's tumor, hypermethylation of both, maternal al paternal alleles, takes place, showing both alleles a behaviour simmilar to paternal allele in normal cells. Thus, CTCF binding region and H19 promoter are both methylated in maternal and paternal alleles, and thus, from both alleles H19 is underexpressed but Igf2 is overexpressed due to the expression from both alleles. Igf2 promotes growth, and the extra dosage of this protein triggers the formation of tumors<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. This drug acts inhibiting DNA methyltransferases. Decitabine is azacitidine, a nucleoside analogous that binds specifically and irreversibly to the active center of DNA methyltransferases, inhibiting the copy of the aberrant hypermethylation pattern of cancer cells during replication. The expected effect on cancer cells is that after a round of replication, hypermethylation of CpG islands of cancer supressor genes is avoided, allowing the back of the cancer cell to a less malignant version of the cell. The interaction of hypomethylated directed-histone modification machinery allowing unpackaging of heterochromatine could also be expected.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering of DNA methylation patterns through epigenetic drugs can affect cancer cells beyond the period of treatment due to the fact that the effect lacking incorporation of methyl groups to DNA during the first round of DNA replication is maintained in the progeny due to the actuation of DNMTs incorporating the methylation marks to the new hemimethylated strands. according to that, the methylation pattern obtained by DNMTi drugs would be maintained by DNA methylation machinery beyond the period of drug treatment.<br />However, the treatment with those DNA hypomethylating drugs should be avoided in pregnant mothers during the firsts stages of embrionic early development after the implantation of the embryo due to the epigenetic reprogramming along the early development, due to the fact that during this sensitive period, epigenetic marks, including methylation are being erased from DNA. the same phenomenon could affect primordialgerm cells development affecting the methylation pattern of gametes. A treatment with this inhibitors of DNA methylation machinery could trigger a hypomethylated stage of DNA, and from mice experiments it is kown that embryos carrying hypomethylated DNA shown a lethal behaviour.<br /></div>
