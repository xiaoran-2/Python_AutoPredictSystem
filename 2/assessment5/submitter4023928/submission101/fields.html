    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to regulate the expression of a gene. A high amount of methylation of a promotor will render a gene transcriptionally silent while a low level of methylation will allow the gene to be expressed depending on the level of transcriptional activity. If the normal patterns of methylation are disrupted this may cause genes that are supposed to be transcriptionally inactive in a specific cell type to become transcriptionally active or a gene that is supposed to be transcriptionally active to become transcriptionally inactive. If this affects genes that regulate the cell cycle such as tumor suppressor genes this could lead to transformation of the cell by rendering the tumor suppressor genes transcriptionally inactive.<br /><br />Intergenic regions contain a large amount of regulatory transcriptionally active sites that produce RNAs that regulate the expression of a large portion of the mammalian genome. If these regulatory regions are silenced in cells this has been shown in studies to induce dysregulations of several genes associated with different forms of cancer, mainly by affecting the post transcriptional processing of mRNAs and mRNA degradation. If the post transcriptional elimination of mRNAs from onkgenes is reduced the amount of translated protein may increase and thus increase the cell prolifferation causing tumor growth. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.<br />The drug Decitabine will reduce the methylation of DNA thus affecting the transcription patterns of the transformed cells. One anti-tumor effect that this drug could have is to reduce the transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes and thus make transformed cells more prone to go into apoptosis either by responding to internal signals or by damage induced by other chemotherapeutic agents. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The DNA methylation patterns are inherited from generation to generation in cancer cells until these epigenetic marks are actively altered. <br /><br />A sensitive period is a period when cells in the body undergo differentiation in some form through changes in the epigenetic patterns of the cell to activate or inactivate specific genes that control the differentiation of cells. For humans these sensitive periods would occur during embryonal development or during formation of germcells. <br /><br />As we have seen in the past there are periods during fetal development when the genome imprinting is done when these kinds of drugs may disrupt the normal development of tissues in the embryo and fetal development. As such these drugs would not be recommended to pregnant women as this could either damage the fetus or potentially affect the child later in life. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19 region codes for a non coding RNA that appears to regulate the expression of Igf2. The maternal chromosome has a lack of methylation in the imprinting control region resulting in expression of the H19 RNA transcript and a down regulation of the Igf2 expression from the maternal chromosome, while methylation in the imprinting control region of the paternal chromosome causes a suppression of H19 transcripts and an upregulation of the Igf2 transcription from the paternal chromosome.<br /><br />Over expression of Igf2 is associated with overgroth of tissues and as such disruption of the normal control of the Igf2 gene can cause an increased growth of tumorcells through stimulation of mormal growth pathways. In embryonic tumors such as Wilms tumor it has been shown that the expression of H19 RNA is downreuglated through increased methylation of the imprinting region of both chromosomes and consequently Igf2 is expressed from both the maternal and paternal chromosomes in the tumor resulting in increased growth stimulus of the tumor cells and surrounding tissues. <br /><br /></div>
