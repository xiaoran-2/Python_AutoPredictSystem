    <h1>Submission 1045 from Anon (session_user_id: 1f2069c8dd5b2d69b1f992b8dd2b54b1d0002291)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine chemically is a cytidine analog. It is ahypomethylating agent which hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, a class of conditions where certain blood cells are dysfunctional, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. And histone-deacetylase inhibitors, made by Celgene and by Merck, another New Jersey-based firm, are being used to treat a rare illness called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal call hypomethylation at CpG island occurs so no methylation at CpG island occurs but methylation occurs at the introns, intergenic region and at repetitive element region.
In a cancer cell the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated and the rest genome is hypomethylated. CpG island genes are found in tumour supressor genes so in a cancer cell they are hypermethylated, even we know that DNA methylation is mitotically heritable which then helpes to silence a tumour suppressor gene. One role for intragenic regions and repetitive element may b and perhaps also prevent aberrant expression from intragenic promoters. Another possible reason for intragenic (within gene body) methylation is that it may increase accuracy of splicing. In contrast to the silencing role of methylation in promoter regions, methylation of gene bodies may promote expression potential. 
IGene body methylated genes are evolving slower than unmethylated genes despite the potential for increased mutations in methylated CpG nucleotides. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
