    <h1>Submission 941 from Anon (session_user_id: 7ee042032c09376ef32c00a64b01163c54e8baba)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation is
very stable, and is maintained during mitosis by DNMT1 which is responsible for
repairing methylation and fully restoring the methylation of hemi-methylated
DNA after mitosis. Consequently the effects of epigenetic drugs that affected methylation
would persist after the drug was discontinued. There are two periods of
development during which it would be ill advised to administer epigenetic
drugs: Early Development and Germ Cell Development. These are known as sensitive periods.
During the sensitive periods epigenetic reprogramming removes the majority of
methylation marks from the cells, resetting them to pluripotency, the DNA is
then re-methylated some time later.</p><p>The use of
epigenetic drugs during the sensitive periods could result in hypo- or
hyper-methylation of the DNA which could affect the embryo, if administered
during Early Development, or the offspring if taken during Germ Cell
Development (gametogenesis). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are
often found in promoters and are protected from methylation, however when an
island in a promoter is methylated the associated gene is silenced, i.e. not
expressed. Cancer is associated with hyper-methylation of CpG islands in
promoters, resulting in under-expression, silencing, of the genes controlled by
the affected promoters. The result of the silencing is that genes responsible
for tumour suppression or growth regulation are under-expressed, allowing for
uncontrolled growth. Since the methylation is mitotically heritable, daughter
cells are also affected and contribute to the cancer. </p><p>Intergenic DNA
methylation is found in highly expressed genes. It appears to be responsible
for maintaining the integrity of the gene, preventing insertions, deletions and
swapping of DNA. Cancer results in
hypomethylation of intergenic regions resulting in genomic instability, and
hypomethelation of cpg poor promoters resulting in expression of oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele
of the H19/lgf2 cluster is methylated at the Imprint Control Region (ICR), in
addition to blocking the binding of the CTCF insulator protein, the methylation
spreads to the H19 promoter, silencing expression of H19. Without the CTCF protein
blocking them the enhancers can access the lgf2 and activate it.</p>

<p> The maternal allele
is not methylated at the ICR, consequently the CTCF insulator protein can bind
upstream of the enhancers to block them from the lgf2. There is no methylation
to spread and the H19 promoter is not blocked.</p>

<p> Normally the ICR of
the H19/lgf2 cluster on the maternal allele is not methylated, when imprinting
is disrupted however, it is methylated. The result of this is over-expression
of lgf2, resulting in Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine
is a DNA-demethylating agent. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase, basically
preventing methylation of the DNA nucleotides. One way Decitabine can have an
anti tumour effect is by inhibitting DNMT1 which is responsible for fixing hemi
methylated DNA, essentially this prevents the methylation from being passed to
daughter cells during mitosis, resulting in the methylation being diluted over
time.</div>
