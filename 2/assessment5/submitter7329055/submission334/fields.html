    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>In a normal cell, the general rule of non-methylated CpG DNA, thus the promoter is active, and the gene can be transcribed (euchromatin). In contrast, the intergenic regions and </span><span><span>repetitive </span>elements are methylated, it maintains the integrity of the genome and its stability (heterochromatin).</span><span><br />In a cancer cell, the first epigenetic event described was hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions, which results in a genomic instability (translocation, insertion, deletion), it can induce an alternative promoter (and no more transcription of the original gene), or creating an overamplification of an oncogene.<br />The hypermethylation of CpG islands will silence the gene, that have an impact if it's a tumor suppressor genes.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, the paternal allele is non-methylated at Igf2(active) and methylated at ICR block, therefore there is inactivation of the H19 promoter and silence of this gene, it follows that the enhancers located just after will make a loop with Igf2. On the maternal allele whose ICR block is activated and linked to CTCF (which insulates and prevents  enhancers to access <span><span>Igf2</span>), H19 is expressed and enhancers make the loop with H19. So we have expression of 1 copy Igf2 and 1 copy H19.<br />In the Wilms' tumor, the ICR blocks are methylated on the 2 alleles, H19 is therefore not expressed, and there are over-expression of Igf2 (which is a cell growth factor), which allows the development of tumors, including kidney, in young children.</span><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) they trap by integrating into the DNA during replication in place of cytosine residues, methylation of the mark is lost during replication that allows the re-expression of suppressor genes tumor extinguished by hypermethylation. And when DNMT1 is bind to it, he finds himself irreversibly bound. As the cancerous cells replicate more rapidly than normal cells, they are more inhibited<span>.</span></span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Epigenetic methylation marks are transmitted through mitosis, so as long as the cell is going to divide, it will continue to provide its epigenetic marks. Therefore, if these marks have been modified, in the daughter cell they will also be changed. </span><span><span> That is why an epigenetic drug can durably alter the epigenome.<br /></span>There are so-called sensitive period, for example the period for which the primordial germ cells grow, or early embryo development periods. At these times, the epigenetic marks are canceled and </span><span><span>re-established</span>, so these periods are sensitive. <br />Therefore a treatment affecting the epigenetic during such periods </span><span><span>(eg children at puberty, pregnant women, fertile men wanting a child<span>)</span></span> may induce an erroneous marking and a risk of cancer, or imprinting defect etc.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
