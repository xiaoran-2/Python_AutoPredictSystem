    <div class="field-value"><p>As cancer progresses, CGI hypermethylation increases at some
promoter loci, which can silence transcription of tumor suppressor genes. Concurrently,
genome wide DNA methylation decreases leading to genetic instability resulting
in loss of genes function that prevent or repair cancer, and/or activation
of oncogenes.</p>

<p>Methylation at CGIs is critical to normal function. Example include
control of normal early development, stem cell development, female embryonic
XCI at gastrulation, imprinted gene expression through ICRs, control of cell
growth, and cell differentiation. With respect to cancer, CGI methylation is
critical in normal cells for maintaining silencing of oncogenes and repetitive
elements, such as IAPs. CGI hypomethylation maintains expression of tumor
suppressor genes. </p>

<p>In cancer, genetic alterations to epigenetic enzymes, or
possibly chemical, environmental or dietary exposure, can lead to epigenetic
alterations that disrupt CGIs through DNA hypermethylation which can silence essential tumor suppressor genes. The extent of CGI methylation at promoter
loci increases with age and as cancer progresses, and CGI methylation patterns can be used as a diagnostic or prognostic marker or panel (CIMP) for cancer. CGI DNA-methylation silencing of tumor suppressor genes contributes to the creation of
a few cancer cells that may be preferentially selected from the population to become tumors because
of their uncontrolled growth and survival. CGI DNA-methylation also contributes to
long range epigenetic alterations that may silence additional sets of tumor suppressor
genes and/or activate oncogenes.</p>

<p>Normally DNA at intergenic regions and repetitive elements are
heavily methylated to afford genomic stability by inhibiting recombination and
maintaining heterochromatin. Over time, and early in tumorigenesis,
hypomethylation of these regions increases. This disruption contributes to
cancer by causing genomic instability: abnormal karyotypes through repeat
amplifications, transpositions, cryptic promoter activation that disrupts neighboring genes, deletions, and reciprocal translocations. These can result
in loss of normal cellular control genes and activation of oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Disruption of imprinting, for example in the H19/Igf2 cluster
in Beckwith Wiedeman Syndrome (BWS), can result in overdose of oncogenic growth
factors from the paternal allele. Normally the ICR of this paternal allele is
methylated, which blocks its binding to CTCF insulator protein, which in turn
allows downstream chromatin loop enhancers to preferentially access and activate
Igf2 gene transcription. The ICR of the normal maternal allele is unmethylated
and binds to CTCF which blocks the downstream enhancers, so the Igf2 gene remains inactivated and is not translated. In Wilm's tumor, there is a loss of the
maternal allele due to a mutation or deletion that results in loss of
imprinting, or unipaternal disomy, or, rarely, epigenetic disruption that leads
to loss of imprinting. Disrupted imprinting of this cluster leads to an
overdose of Igf2 because the maternal allele behaves like a second paternal
allele that also transcribes Igf2. This overdose of Igf2 growth factor
contributes to BWS and the development of Wilm's tumor. Disruption of imprinted
genes, which typically regulate growth factors, is a hallmark of cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA-approved drug for new and previously
treated patients with MDS and AML. It belongs to the class of DNMT1 Inhibitor hypomethylating agents. It inserts into newly-synthesized DNA, irreversibly binds to DNMT1 during
replication of new DNA, and blocks DNMT1's methylation activity. Thus decitabine leads to CGI DNA hypomethylation, enabling tumor-suppressor gene reactivation and helping to
reestablish normal control of cell growth. It seems that altering CGI
methylation in a lasting way (with epigenetic mitotic inheritance) makes some tumor
cells more sensitive to chemotherapy. Decitabine's specificity and mechanism of
action are not fully understood. Because decitabine likely affects all cells,
its long-term effects aren't yet understood (for example, do DNMT1 inhibitors contribute over time, especially in younger patients, to genome wide demethylation leading to genomic instability?). Nonetheless,
Decitabine is effective and very well tolerated by older patients who
failed chemotherapy, extending their life expectancy and quality of life.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Adult somatic DNA methylation alterations are generally stable and mitotically
passed on.  For example, DNMT1
inhibitors cause CGI hypomethylation in faster-dividing tumor cells that rely
on DNMT1 for maintenance of DNA CPI methylation in subsequent generation of
cells. Once DNMT1 is irreversibly inhibited, cells with DNA CGI methylation marks are diluted out by subsequent rounds of mitosis without CPI methylation, even after drug treatment, with enduring effect. DNA methylation
marks are normally removed and reset during two sensitive development periods - times when
the epigenome is most sensitive to changes in its environment. These are primordial
germ cell development, which is from primordial germ cell formation through the
production of mature germ cells , and early embryonic pre-implantation development,
which is from pre-implantation through early post-implantation. Treating certain
patients with DNMT1 inhibitors is inadvisable: fertile female patients
who are or may become pregnant, and male patients who might father a
child while using DNA-demethylating medicines. Loss of GCI methylation
maintenance by inhibiting DNMT1 function at sensitive periods can disrupt
normal imprinting, lineage-specific resetting of epigenetic marks, and
transgene repeats. These alterations could adversely alter patient fertility, normal
embryonic development and survival, and possibly patients' grandchildren by altering normal embryonic germ cell development. </span></p></div>
