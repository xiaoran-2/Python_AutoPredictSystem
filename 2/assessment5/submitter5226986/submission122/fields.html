    <div class="field-value">Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression.<br />In cancer, there is hypermethylation at CpG island and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes and sometimes also in sets of genes (CIMP = CpG island methylator phenotype).<br />This hypermethylation silences tumor suppressor genes which contributes to abnormal division of the cells. Hypermethylation is mitotically heritable to the progeny of the cells and provides a growth advantage (selection advantage) to the cancer cells. Hypermethylation can be one of the several hits required for the onset of cancer (Knidson hypothesis).<br />Normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to silence them and maintain genomic stability.<br />In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.<br />This hypomethylation leads to genomic instability due to activation of repeats and transpositions, inappropriate recombination and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to genes located close by. The consequences depend on the location of the hypomethylation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In paternal allele of Igf2, the ICR  is normally methylated and this results in binding of the enhancers into Igf2 promoter and then in the expression of Igf2 gene.<br />In maternal allele of Igf2, the ICR is normally unmethylated. This allows CTCF to bind into insulator element which prevents enhancers to bind into Igf2. instead the enhancers bind into H19 gene which is then expressed from the maternal allele.<br />In Wilm's tumour, also the maternal allele of the Igf2 ICR is hypermethylated. <br />This results in doubled expression of Igf2, from both maternal and paternal alleles. Igf2 is growth promoting gene and therefore the cells grow too much. This causes kidney tumors in children.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferases so it has a hypomethylating effect.<br />Decitabine is a cytidine analog so it is incorporated into DNA during cell divisions (i.e. replication dependent). It replaces cytidines which would normally be methylated e.g. in the CpG islands. However, decitabine cannot be methylted and instead binds the DNA-methyltransferase that is trying to methylate it. Therefore, methylation is inhibited.<br />Many tumors are a result of hypermethylation of e.g. CpG islands in the tumor suppressor genes. This hypermethylation is prevented by decitabine and results in reactivation of tumor suppressors. Since the effect takes place only in dividing cells, the drug target especially cancerous cells which replicate and divide frequently.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altered DNA methylation can have enduring effects because it is mitotically heritable and therefore passed down to progeny of the cell during cell divisions. It needs to be actively removed in order to be stopped. If these epigentetic alterations happen also in the germ cell line, they can be inherited transgenerationally. Epigenetic cancer drugs are given systemically and therefore affect the whole body, including the germ cells.<br />A sensitive period is a time in development when epigenetics are especially vulnerable e.g. to environmental agents (malnutrition, chemicals, maternal care, etc.). Epigenetic reprogramming happens during these periods.<br />Sensitive periods include early embryonic development and primordial germ cell (PGC) development. Studies on rats and humans have shown that also early childhood development (e.g. first 1000 days of human life) and time for gamete development are sensitive.<br />Treating patiens during sensitive periods with epigenetic drugs can result in epigenetic abnormalities in primordial germ cells and therefore in transgenerational inheritance of the epigenetic alterations. This may lead to infertility or abnormalities in children. Treating pregnant patients may result in epigenetic abnormalities, for example unsuccesful imprinting in the developing embryo. <br /><br /></div>
