    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The ICR is methylated on the paternal allele. Because of this methylation, the promoter of H19 is also methylated and the enhancers upstream provide for the expression of Igf2. The ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele. Because of this unmethylation, a CTCF molecule binds on the unmethylated ICR. Because of the binded CTCF, the enhancers upstream provide for the expression of H19 and don't provide for the expression of Igf2. At Wilm's tumour the ICR on the paternal and also on the maternal allele is methylated. Because of this methylation, the enhancers on the maternal allele also activate the expression of Igf2. So a patient with Wilm's tumour has a doubled expression of Igf2 and no expression of H19. Igf2 is a gene that contributes to growth, when this gene is over expressed there will be an over expressed growth. H19 is a gene that contributes to decrease growth, when this gene is not expressed there will be no inhibition of growth. So the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer by an increase of growth and a decrease in growth inhibition. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation of CpG islands contributes to inactivate DNA. Methylated DNA is densely packed and form heterochromatin, the genes in this DNA are silenced. DNA methylation of CpG islands in cancer is disrupted.This disruption contributes to the activation of tumor suppressor genes. Normally tumor suppressor genes provide the uncontrolled dividing of cells, because the genes are unmethylated and therefore active. But when the tumor surppressor genes becomes methylated, the genes become silenced and then the cell could divide uncontrolled. In a normal cell the CpG islands are unmethylated. Because of this unmethylated islands, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. <br />In a cancer cell the CpG islands are methylated. Because of this methylated islands, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated.This unmethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements activate the genes or promoters that are set in this area. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine contributes to an increase of DNA methylation. The increased methylation caused by Decitabine contributes to stop the developing of a tumor, because it has an anti-neoplastic effect. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of DNA methylation causes genomic instability and deregulation of tissue-specific and imprinted genes. Increase of DNA methylation causes silencing tumor suppressor genes. Adults don't really have a sensitive period, but the older they get, the more sensitive they will be.  During development, there are two different sensitive periods. First period is the pre-implantation period and second period is the primordial germ cells development. Treating patients in one of this periods will cause a lot of damage to other epigenetic reprogramming. For example the x-inactivation and the histone modification. </div>
