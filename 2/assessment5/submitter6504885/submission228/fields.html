    <h1>Submission 228 from Anon (session_user_id: 46b26af9b0f4c7cdc00d1584f2fd676f9eee8cdd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation of a cell have effects beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic changes (like DNA methylation, an especially strong epigenetic mark) are passed through to daughter cells via cell division, and the changes remain for subsequent daughter cells until they are actively erased.</p>Such drugs should be avoided during sensitive periods, which are with respect to epigenetics, periods in which there is a clearing and resetting of epigenetic markers, lest they have unintended side effects on the other markers. These periods include gametogenesis, and pre-implanation and early post-implantation periods. So, people who are pregnant or who may have children in the future should avoid these drugs to avoid affecting their offspring.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating class of epigenetic inhibitors.  By counteracting the over-methylation of DNA, Decitabine allows tumor suppressor genes that would otherwise be silenced to remain active, thereby controlling tumour growth and cancer.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, CpG islands are not methylated (hypothetylated) and the methylation occurs on the other areas, such as repeats and intergenenic regions.<br />However, in cancer, not only is there genome-wide hypomethylation, but there is also an increase in methylation on CpG islands. That is, the CpG islands are hypermethylated instead, and the repeats and intergenic regions are not. This disruption of DNA methylation silences tumor suppressor genes, which are then unable to control cell growth, manifesting itself as cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>Normally the paternal allele is methylated, so the enhancers can activate the lgf2 (lgf2 is expressed). The maternal allele is not methylated so a binder CTCF binds to it, and the enhancers focus on H19 instead (lgf2 is not expressed). </p><p>However, when both alleles are methylated due to some disruption of imprinting at the H19<span>/Igf2 cluster</span>, then the enhancers activate lgf2 on both alleles, resulting it being expressed on both, while H19 is not expressed on either. Since Igf2 is a cell growth regulator, this over expression manifests itself as too much cell growth, leading to Wilms' Tumor, a type of cancer.</p></div>
