    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In normal cells the CpG islands (eg. in the promoter sequence of tumour suppressor gene) are hypomethylated indicating that the gene is active.</li><li>In cancer cells the CpG islands are hypermethylated </li><li>This makes the tumour suppressor gene inactive thereby contributing to cancer as it can't suppress a tumour anymore.<br /></li><li>In normal cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated which keeps them in packed(euchromatin) state.</li><li>In cancer cells these intergenic regions and repetitive elements gets hypomethylated.</li><li>This disruption of DNA methylation results in genomic instability as the repetitive elements are now loosely bound which may result in reciprocal translocation between two chromosome or even deletions or insertions thereby contributing to cancer due to unstable genome.</li></ul><strong></strong></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated due to which CTCF can't bind to it and as a result of which the enhancers can and do act on Igf2 thereby activating it.</li><li>in the maternal allele, the ICR is non-methylated due to which CTCF is able to bind to it thereby disallowing the enhancers to act on Igf2 and it is inactivated in this case.</li><li>In Wilm's tumour, the ICR of maternal allele gets hypermethylated, and as the paternal allele is already methylated, it results in double expression of Igf2 gene than the normal.</li><li>As Igf2 gene is a growth promoting gene, more than usual expression of this gene contributes to cancer. </li><li>Therefore, disrupting of imprinting can contribute to cancer.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine belongs to DNA methyl transferase inhibitors(DNMTi) class of epigenetic inhibitors.</li><li>Decitabine is nucleoside analogues and gets integrated into the DNA upon replication and then when DNMT comes to bind that nucleotide it binds irreversibly to it and then it can't be released.</li><li>As cancer cells replicate more rapidly than normal cells, Decitabine gets incorporated much more in cancer cells than the normal cells thereby preventing the DNMT's from methylating the DNA and thus showing an anti-tumour effect.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome as DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so, the alteration will be present present in the subsequent cells as well.</li><li>Sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming in which clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks occur.</li><li>Pre-implantation period and primordial germ cell development  are sensitive periods of development.</li><li>Treating patients during sensitive period would be inadvisable as during this period resetting of epigenetic marks takes place i.e. the epigenetics marks are removed and then re-established and treatment during this period may interfere with the resetting of the marks and may cause it to go wrong subsequently leading to a disease.</li></ul></div>
