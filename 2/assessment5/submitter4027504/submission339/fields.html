    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands and CpG island shores is normally associated with gene silencing. <br />Cancer cells display locus-specific DNA hypermethylation. Locus-specific DNA hypermethylation in cancer occurs at CpG islands and CpG island shores. <br />Locus-specific DNA hypermethylation can contribute to cancer by silencing tumor suppressor genes.<br />Methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements normally acts to protect genome stability.<br />Cancer cells display genome-wide hypomethylation; hypomethylation in cancer is found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br />Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements promotes genome instability thus leading to translocations and recombinations observed in cancer.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On
the paternal allele, methylation of the ICR prevents binding of CTCF. The
enhancers can access the Igf2 promoter, leading to Igf2 expression.<br />On the maternal allele, the ICR on
the maternal allele is normally not methylated. CTCF binds to the ICR and
blocks the enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promoter, leading to no Igf2
expression.<br />In Wilm’s tumour, we have loss of imprinting whereby the ICR on the
maternal allele is methylated. Methylation of the maternal ICR prevents CTCF
from binding, thereby allowing the enhancers to access the Igf2 promoter.
Whereas H19 is silenced, especially that DNA methylation spreads from the methylated imprint control region to H19 promoter. <br /><span>As
a result of disrupted imprinting at the Igf2 locus, the growth-promoting factor
Igf2, which is an oncogenes, is overexpressed and contributes to tumor growth. </span>H19, on the other hand, is a long non coding RNA, which functions as a tumor supressor, is silenced.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) which triggers DNA demethylation. <br /></p>It can trigger
demethylation of CpG islands in tumor suppressor genes, leading to reactivation
of genes that inhibit tumor growth.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changing the DNA methylation pattern can have effects that last
after mitosis because it\s mitotically
heritable.</p><p>Sensitive
periods are specific periods of epigenetic reprogramming when epigenetic marks are cleared and
reset. These include germ cell
development and early embryonic development. </p><p>

</p><p>Given that in sensitive periods, epigenetic marks are being established, it would be preferable to avoid treating
patients during that period because inhibiting DNA methylation could have more detrimental effects on the genome at
these times. </p>
