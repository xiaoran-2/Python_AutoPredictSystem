    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpG units
are cytocine-guanosine nucleotides next to each other, coupled by a phosphate
group. CpG dinucleotides are underrepresented in the genome with the exception
of CpG islands. These are small CpG-rich regions that, in many cases, are associated
with promoter regions; about half of all genes have a CpG island in their
promoter region. Comparing the CpG Island methylation shows that some genes are
more frequently methylated than others; hence, CpG islands play a critical role
in regulating gene expression. In general, CpG methylation is considered a
silencing epigenetic mark. Most promoter CpG islands are normally unmethylated.<br />In cancer,
however, the hypermethylation of these promoter regions is the most well
categorized epigenetic change to occur; it is found in virtually
every type of human neoplasm and is associated with the inappropriate
transcriptional silencing of genes.</span><br />To increase
genomic stability of the genome CpGs in repetitive elements and intergenic regions tend to be methylated. The primary
function of DNA methylation is to protect the genome (for example by chromatin
compactation) from transposable elements, transcriptional interference or illegitimate
recombination between repeats.<br />In cancers
one sees hypomethylation (i. e. lack of methylation) of intergenic regions and
especially repeats resulting in genomic instability (deletions, insertions,
reciprocal translocations).</p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>A normal
functioning H19/Igf2 cluster exhibits a methylated imprint control center (ICR)
at the paternal allele and an unmethylated ICR at the maternal allele. The
unmethylated ICR is bound by an insulating protein called CTCF that is able to block
Igf2 from the downstream enhancers physically by developing chromosomal loops. Instead the enhancers act on
H19 which actually ats in being a reservoir for a particular micro RNA
which shows expression in many developing organs including fetal and juvenile
kidney. <br />
At the paternal allele this ICR is methylated and CTCF can now no longer bind.
There is no insulator action hence the enhancers can act on Igf2 and promote
Igf2's expression from the paternal allele.  Therefore, Igf2 is expressed
only from the paternal allele (imprinted expression
of Igf2).<br />
The DNA methylation that is found at the ICR can spread downstream
into the H19 promoter and when that becomes methylated, H19 is silenced (CpG island promoter).</span><br />In tumors
with loss of imprinting (LOI), the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal
epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2
turned on and H19 turned off. IGF2 expression is increased so that it is acting
as an oncogene. This situation predisposes for a range of diseases, i. a.
Wilm’s tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Tumor cells
tend to be hypermethylated and thereby i. a. silence tumor suppressor genes. The hypermethylated
state needs to be actively maintained after each cell division, which is
achieved by the catalyzing function of DNA methyltransferases. This has led to
the idea to influence these enzymes by suitable drugs to inhibit the critical
methylation steps. The most widely used DNA methyltransferase inhibitor,
5-azacytidine, is a chemical analogue of the cytosine nucleoside used in DNA
and RNA. Whereas 5-azacytidine is incorporated predominantly into RNA, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine
(Decitabine; modification of the sugar-component) becomes more directly
incorporated into DNA and causes more efficient inhibition of DNA
methyltransferases.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Methylation
(as well as acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination etc.) of DNA is the
basic mechanism for establishing heritable epigenetic marks. In cancers the epigenetic
machinery derails, the normal function is disrupted (growth suppressor genes
are silenced, the expression of growth activating genes is increased; IGF2 –
insulin like growth factor for example). The treatment of cancers by suitable
drugs (“small molecules”) aims at disrupting the cancer epigenome. The hope is
to modify important epigenetic marks in a way that is heritable by the affected
cells. Unfortunately the impact of say azacytidine is not restricted to malign
cells but influences benign areas although. As was shown in lecture 3.9 it is
in general difficult to activate imprinted regions again, but during blastocyst
stage (clearance of parental marks) and during the creation of primordial
germ cells (additionally clearance of imprinted genes) one encounters sensitive
periods; the epigenome might be compromised by anticancer drugs in this time.</span></p>
