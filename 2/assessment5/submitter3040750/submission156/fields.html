    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands (common at promoters of genes) is to silence gene expression. Usually, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to maintain genomic stability and integrity. In cancer, DNA methylation is aberrant, with hypermethylation of CpG islands and global hypomethylation (at repeats/intergenic regions and CpG poor promoters). DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands silences tumor supressor genes (which allows tumorigenesis) in cancer and progresses with time. DNA hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability, which brings about illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. The degree of contribution of each type of methylation disruption varies between different tumours and stages of tumorigenesis. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer, imprinting may be disrupted by hypermethylation or hypomethylation of ICRs. This can result in either loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. In a normal cell, the H19/Igf2 cluster's ICR is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. Then only the paternal allele expresses Igf2 (the maternal ICR is bonded to an insulator factor, which drives enhancers' action to H19 gene). In Wilm's tumour, the ICR of the maternal allele is hypermethylated, leading to expression of Igf2. Therefore, in Wilm's tumour, there is a double dose of the growth promoter Igf2 (compared with a normal cell) and this contributes to cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent (a DNMT inhibitor) used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. The drugs of this class are nucleoside analogues that are incorporated into DNA and irreversibly bind DNMTs during replication, blocking DNMT activity. Therefore the demethylating mechanism of decitabine is replication dependent (and for this reason tumor cells are more affected). That DNA demethylation induces anti-neoplastic effect, mainly in myelodysplastic syndrome, which are dependent on CpG island hypermethylation and tumor supression gene silencing (demethylation reverses silencing and enables the expression of tumor supression genes). </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, which means that the subsequent cell generations formed by mitosis inherit the parental cell's DNA methylation pattern, due to DNMT1 enzyme. Therefore, a cell that underwent the DNA demethylating effect of a drug will pass on this result by mitosis. A sensitive period is the period of epigenetic reprogramming, when epigenetic marks are cleared and reseted. This sensitive periods occur in early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. Treating patients with DNMT inhibitors would be inadvisable in sensitive periods, because the resetting of DNA methylation may be disrupted by the DNA demethylating effect of these drugs. In both sensitive periods, this could lead to serious developmental abnormalities. </div>
