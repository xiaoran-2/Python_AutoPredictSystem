    <h1>Submission 622 from Anon (session_user_id: f7d442999740906014208f129fb3c8de4da22352)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The epigenetic drug Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.It inhibits the enzyme methyltransferase from methylating the daughter strand of DNA after replication.If cells are treated with Decitabine,they lose methylation gradually:After the first cell division, all cells will have one DNA strand (the old/original strand) methylated and the daughter strand would remain unmethylated because DNA methyltransferase is inhibited.After the second cell division, 50% of cells would be half-methylated and the other 50% unmethylated while after the third division, the big majority would be unmethylated.So Decitabine being a DNA demythelating agent leads to the loss of DNA methylation which results in activation of target genes.This drug is used for Myelodysplastic syndromes (types of blood cancer) because they are caused by hypermethylation/silencing of tumour suppressor genes.Decitabine demethylates/activates these genes which slow down tumour growth. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable; in other words, when the cell divides (undergoes mitosis), methylation marks are maintained in the daughter cells.These epigenetic marks are erased ,and then reestablished, twice in a life time:In early embryonic pre-implantation period and in primordial germ cell development period.these two periods of epigenetic reprogramming are called sensitive periods .Unlike genes of paternal genome and maternal genome which are reprogrammed twice, imprinted genes are reprogrammed only once:during primordial germ cell development while repeats seem to escape epigenetic reprogramming.During sensitive periods the epigenome is most vulnerable to environment insults; therefore treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these periods can lead to epigenetic abnormalities .For example,If a pregnant woman is treated with an epigenetic drug when her baby is developing their primordial germ cells,the epigenome of the baby and of the second generation ( the future children of the baby) may have aberrant epigenetic alterations like abnormal methylation, inappropriate unmethylation,disrupted imprinting...</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">ِCpG islands usually occur at promoters of genes and DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to gene silencing. CpG islands of the inactive X chromosome are often methylated while CpG islands at promoters of tumour suppressor genes (genes whose function is to control cell proliferation and inhibit tumour development)  are usually unmethylated allowing the expression of these genes.On the contrary, in cancer CpG islands at promoters of tumour suppressor genes are heavily methylated(hypermethylated) and silencing these genes leads to cancer.Methylation of repeats and intergenic regions is also different in tumour cells compared to normal cells.In normal cells these repetitive elements and intergenic regions are silenced/methylated which preserves genome stability,but in cancer the opposite happens: These parts of DNA are unmethylated/active leading to different types of mutations(insertions, translocations...) and thus resulting in genome instability which is a hallmark of caner.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is usually associated with gene silencing; but in the case of Igf2, it indirectly activates this gene:On the paternal allele, the DNA methylation imprints are on the imprinting control region (the ICR)-and also spread to the promoter of the H19 silencing it- therefore the insulator protein CTCF can't bind to the imprinted ICR and a type of enzymes called enhancers are free to activate the Igf2 .On the maternal allele the CTCF binds to the unimprinted/unmethylated ICR and isolates the IGF2 from the enhancers which act on H19 instead and activate it.We end up with a mono-allelic expression of these imprinted genes in normal cells:an active H19 and silent IGF2 on the maternal allele and a silent H19 and an active IGF2 on the paternal allele.In Wilm's tumour; however, the maternal ICR is also methylated, and the maternal allele starts behaving like the paternal allele which means having double doses of the oncogene IGF2 while both H19 alleles are silent.In normal cells IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele and H19 is expressed from the maternal allele. In cancer imprinting is altered such that the oncogene IGF2 is expressed from both alleles.</div>
