    <h1>Submission 683 from Anon (session_user_id: 4a848e3712e6e0e8785d1b4221fbb285203b6034)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) works to activate (or reactivate, in most cases) genes that prevent or suppress malignancy by inhibiting DNMT1 enzyme and therefore results in DNA hypomethylation (that's why it is also known as a DNA 'demethylater'). DAC has 5-azacytidine ring that forms a covalent bond with the enzyme. Upon the formation of this bond, DNMT1 is inhibited. DNMT1 is the enzyme that responsible to retain DNA methylation during S phase, which is the time when new DNA strand of daughter cell is synthesized. It is also the best time for DAC to work. As a result, the new daughter cells would not have  the same DNA methylation profile with the mother cell and therefore would express genes that previously inactive. In case of cancer, we could help the patients to regain their ability to express tumor-suppressor genes and fight the cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cell, DNA methylation is found on the CpG islands of oncogenes, introns, intergenic regions and on repetitive elements. It functions to silent them out. This methylation is also found on the CpG islands of tumour-suppressor genes, but in much lesser degree. However, in cancer cell the opposite is found. In this cell, the oncogenes, along with intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated (highly expressed) and the tumour-suppressor genes are hypermethylated (silenced). Such condition could happen naturally as we age or could be triggered by environmental mutagen that cause mutation, and eventually, epimutation. <br /><br />The unbalanced expression on the CpG islands between oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes in cancer cells could lead to malignancy. This is because the cell has lost its ability to control cell division, a function that normally performed by tumour-suppressor genes. <br /><br />As what happens with oncogenes, upregulation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cell have a broad effect in genomic stability. For example, the cryptic promoter that resides at intergenic region could inhibit the expression of genes on its upstream or downstream region. The inhibited genes might be essential for cellular metabolism. Another example is transposon that usually found in repetitive elements. Transposon could jump freely to any part in the genome, copy itself, and then jump again to another place. As a result, it could entirely alter the chromosomes through inversion, translocation, deletion, and insertion. Therefore, without proper control on the activity of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, it could lead to malignant tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 cluster is one example of imprinted gene. This cluster consists of Igf2 region, Imprint Control Region (IRC), H19 region, and enhancers. In normal cell, the maternal allele of this cluster would have an unmethylated ICR. Therefore one protein called CTCF could bind to it and direct the enhancers to promote the expression of H19. On the other hand, the paternal allele of this cluster has methylation on ICR and H19 promoter region. It causes CTCF protein cannot access the ICR and as a result, the enhancers are directed to promote the expression of Igf2. <br /><br />However, in Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele has the same methylation pattern as the paternal allele. As a result, Igf2 is expressed from the maternal allele instead of H19. Now the cell has double doses of Igf2 and the whole absence of H19. Igf2 is growth-promoting gene and therefore it leads to tumour (Wilm's tumour in particular).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is one of epigenetic footprint that will be passed on to daughter cells through cell division. It ensures the daughter cell to have an exact function with the mother cell. However, if we use drug that could alter DNA methylation, as a result we would have daughter cells that have different gene expression profile with the mother cell. In some extreme, we might have a very different cell at all. This is why when such drug has high potency to treat cancer, it is very important to consider not to expose the cell with the drug during a sensitive period. This period is called a reprogramming event and  involves a massive DNA demethylation throughout the genome (with exception to repetitive elements). It happens during gametogenesis, early embryonic development, and cell differentiation. If we interfere the undergoing reprogramming event in each of these processes by exposing the cell with the drug, it would lead to cell death or at least to an abnormal cell genetically and phenotypically. <br /></div>
