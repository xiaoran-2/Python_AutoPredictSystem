    <h1>Submission 62 from Anon (session_user_id: eefcf806e6f7b48f0c3ae22bb442baa1698e41a8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine (Dacogen) is a DNA-demthylating agent. <br /></li><li>Decitabine decreases methylation of DNA.<br /></li><li>Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect by lowering methylation and reversing silencing of tumor-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. Decitabine is approved by the FDA for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. It is<span> most effective in myelodysplastic syndrome which is dependent on CpG island hypermethylation. It is also well known that heavy CpG island hypermethylation has a poor prognostic outcome for
myelodysplastic syndrome.</span><br /></li></ul><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p><ul><li>CpG islands, which are usually found in the
promoters of tumor suppressor genes, are usually hypomethylated so that they
remain active and suppress tumor development.<br /></li><li>In cancer, CpG islands particularly in
the promoters of tumor suppressor genes become hypermethylated. However, in CpG poor promoters of oncogene become hypomethylated resulting in activation of oncogenes.<br /></li><li>Hypermethylation of CpG islands of promoters
of tumor suppressor genes results in their silencing which allow the cells that
have this epigenetic modification to divide more rapidly or not die as much as
surrounding tissue. This competitive advantage will allow these cells to
takeover surrounding cells. On the other hand, activation of oncogenes because of hypomethylation of their CpG poor promoters results in unchecked cell growth and tumorigenesis.<br /></li><li>DNA hypermethylation is found in
intergenic regions which functions to silence cryptic transcription start sites
or cryptic splice sites while hypermethylation of repetitive elements functions
to maintain genomic integrity by preventing transposition, avoiding
transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and preventing illegitimate
recombination.</li><li><span>In cancer, intergenic and repetitive elements
are hypomethylated which leads to genomic instability, insertions, deletions, illegitimate
recombination between repeats, and/or reciprocal translocation, activation of
repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to
neighboring genes. This may leads to disruption of tumor suppressor genes, activation of oncogenes, and or increased or loss of expression of growth promoting or growth inhibitory genes, respectively. </span><br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><p>In the IGF2 H19 cluster, the imprint
control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele and thus cannot bind the
insulator element CTCF. Now the enhancers can act on IGF2, because CTCF is not binding
to inhibit this, and IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele.</p></li><li><p></p><p><span>On the other hand, the ICR is
unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it's unmethylated ICR binds its insulator
element CTCF, and the enhancers will act on H19 and not on Igf2 and Igf2 will
be silent for the maternal allele, so we don't see expression. </span></p></li><li><p></p><p><span>However, in Wilm’s tumour there is loss
of imprinting and there is hypermethylation of the imprint control region on
the maternal allele as well. </span></p></li><li><p></p><p>Consequently, because of the
hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele, the enhancers can act on
IGF2, because CTCF is not binding to inhibit this, and IGF2 is expressed from
the maternal allele as well. <span>So we have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison
to what is seen in a normal cell.</span></p></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p><ul><li>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have
enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation changes are passed on
during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are
actively erased.<br /></li><li>A sensitive period is that period during
which epigenetic reprogramming occur.<br /></li></ul><ul><li>

<p>The sensitive periods of development are two, the first
is during early development (preimplantation and early postimplantation) and
the second is during primordial germ cell development to mature egg/sperm.</p></li><li><p></p><p>Treating patients with drugs that alter
DNA methylation during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because they will
disrupt epigenetic reprogramming and this may induce cancer later on.</p></li></ul></div>
