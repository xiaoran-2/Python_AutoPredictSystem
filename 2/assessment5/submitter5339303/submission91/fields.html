    <div class="field-value">In a healthy cell the CpG Islands are normally hypomethylated which is associated with gene activation. During cancer the CpG Islands can become hypermethylated. This generally occurs in the promoters of suppressor genes resulting in these genes being silenced. Tumour suppressor genes are involved in preventing cancer when expressed. This contributes to cells becoming cancerous because when combined with other abnormalities found in cancer cells can result in, for example, increased cellular proliferation and avoidance of apoptosis. The density of hypermythelation increases with age and as the cancer progresses. <br /><br />In normal cells DNA is hypermethylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements which is associated with gene silencing and genome stability. However in cancer cells these regions become hypomethylated.  The most common place where hypomethylation occurs is in the repeats. The consequence of DNA hypomethylation in repeats or intergenic regions is genetic instability. This includes illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition or activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. This can result in insertions, deletions or reciprocal translocations seen in the cancer cells karotype. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> The H19/Igf2 cluster on the paternal allele is hypermethylated. This prevents CTCF (an insulator protein) from binding to the imprinting control region. This allows the DNA methylation to spread to the H19 promotor which is silenced and the enhancers can access and increase Igf2 expression. In the maternal allele the imprinting control region is hypomethylated allowing CTCF to bind. This protein insulates Igf2 from the enhancers and so it isn't expressed. In Wilms tumour a loss of imprinting occurs where both the paternal and maternal alleles are hypermethylated at the imprinting control regions. This results in Igf2 being doubly expressed. Igf2 is involved in growth promotion and too much of this protein can contribute to the excessive growth seen in cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a type of DNA-demethylating agent that is currently approved to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (a group of conditions where the blood cells are not behaving as they should be) that have progressed to acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine works by inhibiting DNA methytransferase (the enzyme normally involved in catalysing the addition of methyl groups to DNA). It does this because it is an analogue of a nucleoside allowing it to be incorporated into the DNA upon replication. It can then bind irreversibly to DNA methyltransferase. This causes hypomethylation of DNA. This may have an anti cancer effect by counteracting the silencing of tumour suppressor genes that have become hypermethylated. Cancer cells are more vulnerable to the effects of Dectiabine because they are replicating at a higher rate compared to heathy cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because it is mitotically hereditable. This means that the DNA methylation is passed on to the daughter cells after cell division and will continue to be passed on through subsequent cell generations. There are times in development, known as sensitive periods, where epigenetic marks are being reprogramed. These sensitive periods are in early development and in germ cell development. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because disruption of this epigenetic reprograming could lead to epigenetic abnormalities which could result in serious side effects. </div>
