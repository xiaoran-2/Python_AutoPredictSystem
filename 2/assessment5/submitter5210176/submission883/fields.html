    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are found at promoters of tumor suppressor genes. In a normal, healthy cell they are hypomethylated, and hypomethylation is generally associated with activity of a gene. Accordingly, tumor suppressor genes are active. In cancer, those CpG islands are hypermethylated and consequently tumor suppressor genes are not expressed. Knudsen hypothesis says that one "hit" or damaging event to the cell is not enough, it takes at least two - for example lack of tumor suppressor and overactivity of an oncogene to set a cell into a state of continuous replication known as tumorigenesis.<br />In intergenic regions and repetitive elements of normal cell there is generally a lot of methylation associated with densely packaged chromatin. Its function is to make those parts of DNA inaccesssible to transcriptional machinery. Repetitive elements because of their repetitiveness of sequence are likely to miscombine with homologous parts of DNA sequence that are in vicinity, but in reality belong to some distant part of the same chromosome or even to the other chromosome. The result are deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocatins. All that can change expression of genes. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is part of the genome - wide hypomethylation. It is observed to progress in a continuous fashion, along with hypermethylation of CpG islands, and both are directly proportional to age, just like occurrence of neoplasms in general population. Because lack of methylation of those parts of DNA makes them loose, the possibility of miscombination is increased, setting path for misexpression of tumor supressor genes and oncogenes. In general, tumorous cells have larger nuclei and more loosely packaged chromatin. Pathologists use that observation in their work for more than 100 years. Proportion of loose chromatin to dense chromatin correlates with tumorigenicity. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">An imprint control region lies between Igf2 gene and H19 gene on chromosome 11. In a healthy cell, that ICR is unmethylated on maternal allele which allows binding of insulator protein called CTCF. That insulator protein prevents folding of DNA into a loop that would bring Igf2 gene in close proximity to an enhancer located downstream of H19 and its enhanced expression. Consequently, Igf2 is silenced on the maternal chromosome. Less prefered loop forms between downstream enhancer and H19 - loop of second choice, which brings about expression of H19, a long noncoding RNA that acts as a reservoir for microRNA.<br />On paternal allele there is methylation on ICR, which prevents insulator protein CTCF from binding. As a consequnce, prefered loop between downstream enhancer and Igf2 is able to form, and Igf2 gets expressed. Also, methylation from ICR is known to spread to H19 which silences it.<br />Imprinting of Igf2/H19 cluster on paternal allele allows for expression of only one Igf2 gene. When maternal allele shows same imprint like paternal, then both Igf2 alleles are active and dose of Igf2 is doubled. This is seen in Wilm's tumor. Igf2 is a growth factor, promotes growth - its double dose correlates with tumorigenicity</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor - it inhibits DNA methyltransferase, an enzyme responsible for methylation of DNA. This class of drugs is a nucleoside analog - it irreversibly binds DNMT after the are incorporated into DNA. This mechanism of action makes them replication dependant.<br />Decitabine reduces hypermethylation of CpG islands. This is perhaps why it's most effective in haematological malignancies, myelodysplastic syndrome, as they are dependant on tumor suppressor gene promoter hypermethylation.<br />Reducing CpG island hypermethylation, decitabine can bring back original level of expression of tumor suppressor gene which can then prevent uncontrolable replication of the cell. In this way, epigenetic mutations are easier to treat than genetic mutations. Patients, usually older people, show little side-effects, so there are hopes that it could be used in combination with standard chemotherapy to reduce its dose, for standard chemotherapy is notorious for its side-effects.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation patterns are inheritable -this is important for establishment of cell lineages after differentiation has took place. DNA methyl transferase is responsible for copying methyl marks from template to new chain.<br />A sensitive period is when disruption of epigenetic processes has most detrimental effect - when epigenetic marks are layed down, setting path for propper gene expression further. Most sensitive periods are early development(pre-implantation period) and primordial germ cell development, where DNA methylation is being removed to be reset. <br /> Other sensitive periods include young people in general - in childhood there is growth and forming of organs with which epigenetic treatment might interfere. In adults, sensitive periods concern procreationg, conceiving a child. Folates are advised to women 3 months prior conception - likewise, epigenetic treatment in that period at least might have detrimental effect on the child. Men are also in danger, due to the nature of spermatogenesis. Maintaining period of those epigenetic marks is less sensitive, although if given in doses that are much larger than current therapeutic doses, epigenetic drugs show toxicity.<br />Treating people during those sensitive periods wouldn't be advisable because it might disrupt laying down epigenetic marks which would result in damage, illness, or even death.</div>
