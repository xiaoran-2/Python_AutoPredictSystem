    <div class="field-value">In a healthy cell CpG islands are mostly free of methylation. However, in cases when a CpG island is methylated it is associated with silencing of the underlying gene. In cancer such CpG island methyaltion and subsequent silencing occurs at CpG islands which are not supposed to be methylated. Predominantly these CpGs are located in promoter regions of growth supressor genes or genes controlling cell cycles and DNA repair. This gives cancer cells their characteristic ability to divide unconditionally (w/o apoptosis) and with greater speed than normal cells. If the affected gene is responsible for DNA repair its silencing impaires the cell's ability to repair DNA damage thus contributing to DNA instability.<br />In contrast to CpG islands, CpGs present in the genome body are very frequently methylated. In healthy cells intergenic regions neighboring repetitive elements are highly methylated to ensure their silencing for genome stability. Otherwise, in case the repeats were activated, they might disrupt the genome by inserting a copy of themselves inside another gene or their expression might lead to an excess of proteins they code. This happens in cancer cells: CpGs at repetitive elements lose their methylation as the cancer progresses, which disrupts the genome architecture, leading to several typical errors: insertion, deletion, undesirable recombination and duplication. <br />Yet not all methylation brings about transcriptional silencing: in contrast, gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and a hypothesis exists that it contributes to gene activation by <span>repressing transcriptional noise from alternative start sites and inhibiting antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing. Losing this methylation makes transcription of the underlying gene less effective.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster the paternal allele has a methylated ICR, which doesn't allow CTCF to bind and allows the enhancers to access the Igf2 gene, while the maternal allele has an unmethylated ICR, to which CTCF binds, insulating the Igf2 gene located upstream and allowing the enhancers to access the H19 gene. Thus Igf2 is only expressed from the paternal allele and H19 from the maternal allele. This mechanism is called the insulator model of imprinting. It is disrupted in a cancer called Wilm's tumor: in a case of uniparental disomy both alleles end up having a methylated ICR, therefore Igf2 gene is expressed from both of them. As Igf2 is a growth promoter this loss of imprinting causes cells to have an abnormal growth rate, one of the hallmarks of cancer.  <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent - it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase DNMT1. Decitabine is a passive demethylating agent - its function is dependent upon cell division: <span>Decitabine </span>incorporates in the DNA during replication and blocks DNMT1 from restoring the methylation pattern to the daughter strand upon replication, so that the DNA is left hemimethylated. Although Decitabine affects all dividing cells, normal cells have a much lower division rate than the cancer cells, therefore the right dosage of Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic drugs target specific epigenetic marks (depending on which type of drug) and have to be chosen depending on the type and stage of cancer which determines the dominant type of disruption of the epigenome. While some of them might not directly result in the death of cancer cells, correctly administered epigenetic drugs  change the epigenome in such a way as to deprive cancer cells of their characteristic invasive and agressive abilities, making them more susceptible to chemotherapy. Yet one has to remember that epigenetic drugs are not selective and their benefit depends on cancer cells being affected more than healthy ones (usually due to the difference in division rates). This might not be true in certain sensitive periods - periods when the epigenome is undergoing transformation - resetting of the epigenetic marks. The most sensitive periods are germ cell and early embryonic development, but certain tissues have secondary sensitive periods in childhood and puberty. Treating patients in these periods with epigenetic drugs can have a lasting effect on their epigenome that may cause issues all though their life.</div>
