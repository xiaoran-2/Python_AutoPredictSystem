    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell there is genome-wide methylation and hypomethylation of CpG islands. However, in cancer, there is a genome-wide loss of methylation and CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. In general the CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, therefore, as a consequence of their hypermethylation, the expression of these genes is inactivated, which is one of the factors found in cancer cells.<br /><br />On the other hand, in a normal cell intergenic intervals and repetitive elements are methylated in order to maintain genomic stability and prevent loss of chromosomes, gain chromosomes or have illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes. In a cancer cell there is hypomethylation of repeats or intergenic intervals, having as a result illegitimate recombination between repeats. This takes place due to the fact that the chromatin opens up and enables recombination.<br /><br />Finally, CpG poor promoters, which are promoters without sufficient density of CpGs to be considered a CpG island, become hypomethylated in cancer, and are associated with activation of onco genes, by enabling the expression of microRNAs  that target tumor supressors, reducing their expression.<br /><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, the imprint control region in the IGF2 H19 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. In the maternal allelle, being unmethylated, the CTCF binds its insulator element and then enhancers acts on H19, and there is no expression of IGF2. In the paternal allele, being methylated, CTCF is not binding and thus the enhancers can act on IGF2, which is expressed and H19 is not expressed. There is expression of IGF2 from the paternal allele but not from the maternal allele, and expression of H19 from the maternal allele but not from the paternal allele.<br /><br />When there is loss of imprinting, there is hypermetylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele too. Therefore, IGF2 is also expressed from the meternal allelle, so there is expression of IGF2 from both paternal and maternal allele, resulting in doubling the dose of IGF2 compared with a normal cell, and reducing the expression of H19. IGF2 is growth promoting and H19 normally restrains growth, so the combination of double dose of IGF2 and reduced dose of H19 is associated with several types of cancer, in particular with Wilm's tumor. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors class. As a cell is dividing and DNA gets replicated, DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 binds to the hemi-methylated CpG dinucleotide to copy its methylation to the daughter strand, maintaining the methylation of the CpG dinucleotides in the new cell. Decitabine, being a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, prevent the action of DNMTs, stopping the propagation of CpG methylation to new cells in cell division. <br /><br />In some cancers, an in particular in myelodysplastic syndrome, CpG islands are hypermethylated, inhibiting the expression of tumor suppressor genes. DNA methyltransferase inhibitor stops the propagation of the methylated CpG islands to the new cells, reactivating the expression of the tumour suppressor genes, acting against the growth of the tumour.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, that is, are maintained during cell division. If the DNA methylation of a cell is altered, the daughters of this cell will preserve the methylation alteration of the parent cell, and this new methylation pattern will be maintained in the subsequent daughter cells. Therefore, despite of the fact that the treatment with the drug that altered the DNA methylation stops, the daughter cells will contain the new configuration that will propagated to the new cells.<br /><br />A sensitive period is defined as the period when epigenetic active reprogramming occurs, when removal and then laying down of epigenetic marks in the genome as a whole take place. These two periods are primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development. If a patient is treated with drugs that alter DNA methylation during these two periods, for example in pregnancy early stages or the production of mature eggs, it may affect the epigenetic reprogramming process altering the epigenetic configuration of the epiblast and the gametes and resulting in imprinting disorders or highest probabilities of future diseases.<br /><br /><br /></div>
