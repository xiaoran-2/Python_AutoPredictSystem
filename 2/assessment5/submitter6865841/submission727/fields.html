    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">1) Normaly DNA methylation at CpG islands cause silencing of the gene.<br />2) In cancer often oncogenes are hypomethylated (activated) and tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated (silenced). Generaly speaking. Genome as whole looses methylation. Some CpG islands are hypermethylated. <br />3) Hypomethylation of oncogenes activate them and cause cancer cell to grow/divide/etc.. . Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes stop normal regulation of cellcycle or correction mechanismus of DNA. For example disables opoptosis or repairing DNA.<br />4) Normally these regions and elements are highly methylated.<br />5) In cancer often these regions are hypomethylated.<br />6) These regions and elements can change position inside genome and case genetic aberrations. High methylation prevent this migration and promote genome stability. In cancer hypomethylation enables migration. This trans location can divide tumor suppressor gene and render him useless. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1) Paternal allele is hypermethylated at ICR region. Enhancers effect on Igf2 region and activates it.<br />2) Maternal allele is hypomethylated at ICR region that binds CTCF protein and insulate Igf2 region rendering him silent.<br />3) In Wilm's tumour imprinting is lost. ICR region is hypermethylated at both alleles. Enhancers effect on Igf2 region and activates it.<br />4) Loss of imprinting cause over expression of growth factor and acts as oncogen. It promote cancer behavior of the cell.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1) Decitabine is DNA-demethylation agent.<br />2) Decitabine removes DNA methylation.<br />3) Decitabine works in two ways:<br />a) Loss of methylation of silenced tumor suppressor genes activates them and enables normal cell cycle regulation.<br />b) Decitabin belongs to group of medicine substances called <span>antimetabolites. They have strong cytotoxic efect.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1) DNA methylation is very stable and mitotically heritable.<br />2) Sensitive period is period of individual development that is sensitive to environment. It is period of epigenetic reprogramming.<br />3) In human develepment there is one sensitive period during pre-implantation development and second one during <span>primordial germ cell development.<br />4) </span>First sensitive period is too early to consider treatment for cancer. Main concern is treating patient that is developing germ cells. It would cause great impact on epigenetic reprogramming (environmental changes would be huge considering epigenome) and possibly cause sterility of the patient.</div>
