    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation (generally) at CpG islands is to act on promoter regions of genes (inversely correlating with gene expression) to control the expression of genes.  CpG islands have high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state.  In cancer cells, however, promoter CpG islands are hypermethylated and this causes silencing of the underlying gene.  Silencing of a tumor suppressor gene can lead to cancer.  Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands can lead to overexpression of oncogenes as well (i.e. if the promoter regions are unmethylated/hypomethylated in instances where they should be methylated, then you will get uncontrolled proliferation due to increased oncogene activity).  If, however, the CpG island at the promoter of a tumor suppressor gene is hypermethylated, then you will lose function of the tumor suppressor gene (i.e. PTEN is a classic example in prostate cancer), ultimately leading to uncontrolled proliferation.  Hypermethylation of CpG islands also include single gene examples which contribute to cancer such as RB, MLH1, MGMT, and BRCA1.  The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to repress repetitive sequences such as alpha satellite sequences and remnants of retroviral sequences such as LINEs and SINEs.  In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated/unmethylated, and this significantly increases the genomic instability of the cell, which can result in genetic aberrations such as insertions, deletions, translocations, amplifications, and copy number variations.  These aberrations are characteristic of cancer cells and can also define particular subtypes of cancers as a molecular profile of CpG marks.  Therefore, the methylation patterns of genes at CpG islands are an important factor to consider in the epigenetic considerations of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, as aberrations in epigenetic control can lead to hypermethylations at ICRs resulting in loss of imprinting.  The methylation pattern on the paternal allele in a normal cell consists of a methylated H19 locus (not active) and normal expression of IGF2.  The methylation pattern on the maternal allele in a normal cell consists of an unmethylated H19 locus (active) and a repressor on CTCF which does not allow the expression of IGF2 (not active).  Therefore, in a normal cell, IGF2 expression is stable through stable imprinting.<br />However, in Wilm's tumor, both the maternal and paternal alleles are hypermethylated whereby H19 is not active and there is no repressor on CTCF.  As a result, IGF2 is highly active on both the maternal and paternal alleles, leading to overexpression of this gene.  The disruption of this imprinting region is a classic example of an alteration in DNA methylation in which it can result in the overexpression of growth-promoting genes (or the loss of expression of growth-restricting genes).  Hypermethylation of the H19/IGF2 cluster contributes to cancer by the loss of imprinting, resulting in IGF2 overexpression in Wilm's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor).  This drug acts as a DNA demethylating agent by inhibiting the activity of DNMT.  In cancer, DNMT may be overactive, thus increasing the amount of histone overmethylated regions on genes such as tumor suppressors.  As a result, if there is overactivity of DNMT on a tumor suppressor gene, the cell will undergo uncontrolled proliferation.  The inhibitor Decitabine acts to inhibit and reduce the activity of DNMT (it is a DNMT inhibitor).  Therefore, Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect by significantly decreasing the amount of histone overmethylation, reducing the proliferation of tumor cells.  Decitabine is also used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), which are the precursors of acute mylogenous leukemia.  A combination of DNMTi and HDACi inhibitors can help slow down and reduce tumor growth.  This area is a promising field in the epigenetic studies of cancer in identifying diagnostic/prognostic value for clinical utility.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, as the epigenetic signature is mitotically passed down during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.  A combination of HDACi and DNMTi inhibitor drugs can alter the epigenome of progeny cells in a lasting way, which may be clinically beneficial if a subsequent course of treatment, i.e. chemotherapy, is administered in which there may be a good reaction as the tumor cells are now more susceptible to the chemical therapeutic agent. However, one must consider these lasting epigenetic effects prior to administration of small molecule inhibitors that target enzymatic epigenetic regulators.  For example, treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable, as there are sensitive periods to consider in which the host genome is susceptible to epigenetic changes during particular periods of growth.  In younger people, the effects on primordial germ cell development need to be considered in context to epigenetic marks, as this is a sensitive period.  Also, another sensitive period includes early embryonic development.  Treating patients with epigenetic enzyme inhibitors during these sensitive periods can lead to significant genomic instability, ultimately resulting in further disease.  </div>
