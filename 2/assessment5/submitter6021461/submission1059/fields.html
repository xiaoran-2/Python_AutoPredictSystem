    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Many CpG islands are found in the
promoter area of the genes, and as such are not methylated.  But in cancer the CpG islands in the
promoters are found to be hypermethylated, which causes the gene involved to be
silenced. The genes that are silenced in cancer are tumor-suppresor genes which
allow the cancer to develop as it is not stopped. The hypermethylated CpG
islands vary in different tumors and can be used in prognosis. Methylation in
intergenic regions and repetitive elements preserves genome stability. In
cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated  causing genomic instability leading to
illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and
transposition and cryptic promoters.</span></p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The H19/Igf2 locus has the H19 imprinting control region (ICR), and has
parent-of-origin specific methylation patterns. 
In the paternal allele the H19 ICR is methylated allowing the expression
of Igf2, by preventing the recognition of the CTCF.  In the maternal allele the H19 ICR is not
methylated allowing the activity of the H19 promoter, binding of the CTCF, and
prevents the expression of the Igf2. In Wilm´s tumor there is methylation of
the maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster, and there is an excess of
expression of the Igf2, as it behaves like the paternal allele so the
imprinting is lost.  So the
hypermethylation contributes to cancer silencing or avoiding the transcription of
tumor suppressing or growth restriction genes.</span></p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor classified as DNA-demethylating
agent, as such it reduces DNA methylation, removing methyl groups that could
cause silencing of tumor suppressor genes. 
Mutations of enzymes cause overmethylation, and thus cancer when
protecting genes are silenced, so if decitabine controls the excess
methylation, it will have an anti-tumour effect.</span></p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has lasting effects
on the epigenome because it is mitotically inheritable. A sensitive period is
when the epigenetic marks are established. A sensitive period of development is
the first ten days after birth, also prenatal period. Treatment of patients during sensitive periods have a lasting effect on the epigenome, it is the moment when the epigenetic marks are established and treatments can have side effects on other areas making equivocal marks that would stay life-long.</p><span>
