    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In a healthy person, most of the CpG islands are unmethylated
and this serves to ensure that the DNA is “open” (not densely packaged) and
that gene expression can take place. The lack of methylation also makes the DNA
at the CpG sites more stable and less susceptible to mutation. In cancer, the
CpG islands associated with promoters are often hypermethylated in cancer and
this can cause permanent silencing of the associated gene as the aberrant epigenetic
mark is passed from one daughter cell to the next. Hypermethylation of these
CpG islands can lead to the silencing of one or more tumour suppressor genes as
well as DNA repair genes and/or genes involved in controlling cell proliferation,
amongst others. This silencing of genes involved in the proliferation of cells,
may lead to a loss of control of cell growth and therefore a greater risk of
developing cancer. </span></p>

<p><span>In a healthy person the CpG sites found in intergenic
regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated, and this methylation
is necessary to ensure proper embryogenesis (imprinting;  <span>etc.); chromosomal stability and expression or
silencing of particular genes. In cancer these regions are usually hypomethylated
(global hypomethylation), leading to genomic instability and deregulation of
imprinted genes. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements
leads to open chromatin which is activated. These regions would normally be
methylated and hence the chromatin would be densely packaged and hence in
active. Activated repetitive elements can translocate by jumping and thus
disrupt gene expression, depending on where they are translocated to.
Hypomethylation of intergenic regions can also lead to activation of cryptic
start sites, cryptic splice sites or neighbouring promoters that were
previously silenced, and an increase in mutation rate (C to T). Such disruption
can lead to cancer.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Hypermethylation of the imprinting control region (ICR) can
lead to over-expression of Igf2 leading to Wilm’s tumour. </span></p>

<p><span>The normal paternal allele is usually methylated, i.e. both
the imprinting control region (ICR) and the promoter for the gene <i>H19</i> are methylated. This prevents <i>H19</i> from being expressed and leads to
the expression of <i>IGF2. IGF2</i> is a paternally
expressed imprinted gene.</span></p>

<p><span>The normal maternal allele is unmethylated at the ICF and
forms a complex with CTCF (CCCTC binding factor) which helps to block
interaction between the <i>IGF2</i> promoter
and the H19 associated enhancers. On the maternal allele the promoter for H19
is also unmethylated. This allows H19 to be expressed and IGF2 will not be
expressed. </span></p>

<p><span>In Wilm’s tumour both the paternal and maternal allele are
methylated at the ICR and the H19 promoter i.e. both are silenced at H19 and
therefore a double dose of IGF2 is produced i.e. it is over-expressed. </span></p>

<p><span>Hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal chromosome is as
a result of the loss of imprinting. <i>IGF2</i><span>
is growth promoting and the over-expression of this protein can therefore lead
to the formation of cancer.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent and has an impact by
demethylating DNA. Cancer cells are rapidly dividing and thus more easily
influenced by drugs that act during cell proliferation, than normal, healthy
cells would be. Decitabine binds to DNMTs, which are responsible for maintaining
methylation status, and by binding to DNMTs Decitabine inhibits it’s action, and thereby brings about demethylation. The demethylated status
of the DNA is passed on to daughter cells during cell division, and in turn to
granddaughter cells, and hence the “cancerous” epigenetic marks are removed.
Decitabine doesn’t kill the cancer cells, but prevents them from growing and thus
has an anti-tumour effect.<span class="_wysihtml5-temp-placeholder"></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Altering DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the
epigenome as epigenetic changes are stably inherited in that they are passed on
from one generation of daughter cells to the next, until the new epigenetic
mark is the only epigenetic mark at that site.  DNA methylation is stable and is mitotically
inherited from one daughter cell to the next i.e. the epigenetic state is
unlikely to change unless induced to do so.  </span></p>

<p>Sensitive periods are periods of time during which
epigenetic marks are cleared and laid down again.</p>

<p>Sensitive periods include primordial germ cell development and
preimplantation and early implantation i.e. early development and whilst epigenetic marks are being
accumulated (between the blastocyst and epiblast stage).</p>

<p><span>It would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive
periods as their epigenetic state, particularly imprinted genes (both global methylation and CpG island
methylation as well as other genetic marks) would be altered, and this could
lead to numerous disorders and imprinting problems.</span></p></div>
