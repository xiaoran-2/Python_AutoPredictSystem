    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism that (along with other mechanisms) govern whether or not  a gene will be expressed. Generally DNA methylation at CpG islands in promoter regions of genes inhibit the expression of the associated genes. Normally those CpG islands are unmethylated, however in cancer cells those CpG islands become hypermethylated, leading to the silencing of tumor-suppressor genes, which result in uncontrolled cellular division, ultimatelly resulting in the development of tumors. In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation prevent the expression of oncogenes preventing anarchy in cell division. In the case of Cancer, we know that these DNA methylation are removed, thereby allowing the expression of oncogenes at higher rate. This absence of control of the expression of oncogenes in intergenic regions and repetitive elements lead to the development of  cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele, the imprinting control region is methylated, thereby preventing the binding of CTCF insulator protein. This allow the enahancers to act freely on Igf2 promoter allowing its expression. However on the maternal allele, the imprinting conctrol region is unmethylated, this allow the insulator protein CTCF to bind to this control region. This binding block the enhancers preventing the expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene thereby oncogene. In Wilm's tumor there is a loss of original imprinting of H19/Igf2 cluster especially if the individual received two paternal allele.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decetabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that can disrupt the DNA methylation in cancer state. This demethylation in CpG islands could lead to the expression of tumor-suppressor genes thereby slowing down the  excessive growth in the tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects  on the epigenome since epigenetics marks once laid, are mitotically inherited and thereby passed on to the daughter cells. So a drug that can remove the methylation of DNA at CpG islands in the promoter of tumor-suppressor genes will allow the genes to be expressed and since epigenetic marks are inherited by daughter cell, this can have some lasting effects. However it is important to consider sensitive period especially in younger patients. We know that epigenetic marks are reset during primordial germ cell development, so it is important not to administer epigenetic drugs during this time since all  these marks are removed back to their original state.  </div>
