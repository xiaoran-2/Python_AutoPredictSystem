    <div class="field-value">Most CpG islands are not methylated, with exceptions being some x-linked and imprinted genes, so methylation's absence permits gene expression of, for instance, tumor suppressor genes. In cancer, this is disrupted and the CpG islands become methylated, thus usually silencing tumor suppressor genes. By silencing these tumor suppressor genes, the methylation can be thought of as one of the hits in the Knudsen hypothesis. So in the presence of other hits, the cancer cells are not inhibited and growth becomes unstoppable.<br /><br />Intergenetic regions and repetitive elements are normally more heavily methylated than CpG islands. The methylation depends on location but the functions seem to be primarily to suppress oncogenes and to contribute to general genomic stability. This is disrupted in cancer by hypomethylation of these areas. This lack of methylation allows the expression of oncogenes which directly contributes to cancer. Additionally, the genomic instability leads to more deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations, which can lead to "cryptic promoters" and disruption to neighboring genes, thus another potential hit in Knudsen's hypothesis. This has been shown in both mouse studies and many human cancers. Less common but equally harmful is hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters which can result in the expression of an otherwise silenced gene, sometimes these are oncogenes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele is imprinted which means the ICR is methylated. This prevents CTCF from binding to it which in turn allows the downstream enhancer to loop back and activate Igf2. Additionally, the imprinted methylation spreads to H19 and inhibits its expression<br /><br />The maternal allele has an unmethyalted ICR so the CTCF can bind and act as an insulator to prevent the downstream enhancers from acting on Igf2. Since there is no methylation to spread to H19, it is unmethylated and the enhancers activate H19 expression.<br /><br />Disruption basically equates to having both alleles act like the usual paternal allele. This can be through a mutation/deletion or uniparental disomy (paternal disomy in this case) or, more rarely, epigenetic disruption causing the imprinting disruption. So we get an upregulation of Igf2 which is an oncogene. This leads to runaway growth and a condition known as Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome. One of the results of this is Wilm's tumor, which is a predisposition to embryonic/childhood kidney tumors, but not adult.<br /><br />Like many imprinted genes, the H19/Igf2 cluster is involved with a growth gene, so disrupting the imprinting at an oncogene permits overexpression or upregulation of that gene, thus a common feature of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent or DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. These are incorporated into the DNA on replication and as growth occurs become irreversibly incorporated  Prescribed in lower doses than in the past, they serve to decrease methylation, though they are not targeted, so there may be some effect on all cells that divide. But cancer cells divide rapidly and often so they are affected far more. In tumors and cancer where a cause is hypermethylation of tumor suppressors, Decitabine can inhibit this methylation and thus allow expression of the tumor suppressor gene.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes are, by definition, mitotically heritable, so these changes are passed on as cells divide. This change in methylation changes the structure as part of changing expressivity which allows the DNA to literally be more open to chemotherapeutic drugs.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming, which is a requirement for mitotic heritability,  when the cell is particularly vulnerable. There are 2 main periods, though there are some sensitive periods when cells are going though differentiation but those are organ dependent not genome-wide.<br /><br /><div>One sensitive period is primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperm. A second sensitive period is the pre-implantation period and early post-implantation period, Both of these periods are periods of active remodeling of the epigenome.</div><div><br />The cell is more sensitive to damage because epigenetic marks have, for the most part, been removed for reprogramming. Treatment during these times can cause detrimental reprogramming.</div></div>
