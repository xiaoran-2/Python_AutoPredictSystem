    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cell, CpG islands are mostly unmethylated. In cancer, hypermethylation of CpG island occurs very frequently and increases with time. This hypermethylation may lead to silencing of tumor suppressor genes that can be one of the hits contributing to tumorogenesis. The profile of hypermethylation is specific for each type of cancer and may be used for diagnosis, identifying a specific feature of the cancer and prognosis.</p><p>At the same time, most intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which are methylated and silenced in normal cell, in cancer acquire hypomethylated state. It is also progresses with tumorigenicity and is characteristic for all tumor types tested. Such genome-wide hypomethylation leads to global genomic instability that may be expressed in illegitimate recombination, activation of repeats, transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Each of them may contribute to tumorogenesis.</p>Generally, role of DNA methylation in cancer is strictly depended on context. Disruption by both hyper and hypomethylation may cause tumorogenesis in the certain case.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>Disruption of imprinting due to hypo or hypermethylation of imprinting control regions can contribute to cancer by loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. Wilm’s tumour is an example of cancer caused by hypermethylation of imprinting control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster.</p><p>In normal cell ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster methylated on the paternal allele. It allows enchancers to activate Igf2 gene. On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated. In this case CTCF factor binds to the ICR, and enchancers activate gene H19. Igf2 remains silent.</p>In Wilm’s tumour maternal ICR of the H19/Igf2 is hypermethylated, so it acts as paternal, and as a result, Igf2 gene is active from both alleles. Double dose of it contribute to Wilm’s tumour because<span> Igf2 gene is growth promoting.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome. It is demethylating agent and its effect depends on cell division. Decitabine is nucleoside analog, and it is included in DNA during replication. Then, when DNA methyltransferase comes to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, it binds irreversibly and can’t be released.</p><p>Decitabine can have anti-tumor effect may be because it can decrease the degree of hypermethylation of CpG islands. This drug is mostly effective in myelodysplastic syndrome possibly because this tumor depends on CpG islands hypermethylation.</p><span>Cancer cells apparently are more sensitive to this drug because they divide much more rapidly in comparison to normal cells.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>There are sensitive periods in development during which organism is highly sensitive to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. This means that changes occurred in these periods may persist for a long time, may be for a whole life. These periods are germ cell development and embryonic development when epigenetic reprogramming occurs.<span> Methylation status acquired during sensitive periods maintained and transferred through the cell generations by mitotic inheritance. That’s why any intervention to the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms at this time such as epigenetic drugs may have enduring effects on organism. Along with correction of the epigenetic errors  it may lead to disruption of normal epigenetic function.</span></span></div>
