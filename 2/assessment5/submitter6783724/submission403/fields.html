    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Normally
CPG islands are not methylated. CPG islands are areas of tumour suppressor genes.
In cancer cells CPG islands become hypermethylated silencing the tumour
suppressor genes. This causes the cancer cells to multiply unrestricted. Intergenic
regions are normally methylated. However, in cancer cells these regions can
suffer from hyper or hypo methylation leading to genomic instability. This can
involve illegitimate recombination between repeats, the activation of repeats,
transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring
genes. Repeats result in activation of genes and therefore genomic instability.
 Hypo methylation in CPG poor promoters
leads to the activation of genes. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The disruption of imprinting contributes to
cancer by causing either a loss if expression of growth restricting genes or
overexpression of growth promoting genes. Hypermethylation of ICR causes an
overexpression of IGF2 in Wilms tumour. In normal cells the maternal H19
inhibitor is active due to it not being methylated. This inhibits the enhancers
and thereby inhibits the IGF2 gene, The CTCF is not methylated either. Where as
in the paternal ICR the H19 is hypermethylated and thereby enhancers activate
the expression of IGF2. The methylation of the CTCF allows further expression.</p>

<p><span>In Wilms tumour however CTCF and H19 are
methylated on the maternal and paternal alleles. This allows the enhancers to
express the maternal IGF2 gene. As the paternal IGF2 is also still being
expressed this leads to an overexpression of IGF2.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine
is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitors DNMTi. The nucleosides bind DNMTS irreversibly
after they are incorporated into DNA. They are replication dependent. Decitabine
would reduce the level of DNA methylation and would have an antitumor effect by
preventing methylation of DNA or CPG islands thereby maintaining the tumour suppressor
genes active.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic therapies affect changes which
stops the growth of cancers without having to kill all the cells. These epigenetic
changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until
they are actively erased however once erased they don’t return. Sensitive
periods are periods when epigenetic reprogramming occurs and all the epigenetic
marks are cleared i.e. germ cells. It would be inadvisable to treat patients
during these sensitive periods as the epigenome is susceptible to the environment
and drugs etc. which can result in alterations that may not be desired written
to the DNA , defects in unborn children or future generations could occur as a
result of epigenetic drugs being given during a sensitive period.</span></p></div>
