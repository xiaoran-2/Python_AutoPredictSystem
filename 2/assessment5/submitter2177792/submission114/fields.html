    <div class="field-value">The DNA methylation in CPG islands are related with specific genetics modifications that triggers the presence of cancer. The  systems of DNA methylations works thanks to the DNA methyltranferase, whom add methyl groups in cytosines in 5' direction and these are add here because they maintain the stability of cell division, process in which methyl groups are added. The CPG islands are related with promoters of genes, normally these islands are methylated,  silencing genes, giving stability to chromosomes, also the presence of methyl groups forbid the binding od transcription factors truncating the transcription of the genes. Following the above, when the CPG islands doesn't work correctly the genes are expressed constitutively, and the DNA structure lose its stability promoting anormallities in the cells relates with grow and size.<br />Likewise the intergenic regions and repetitive elements serve to mantain the stability od DNA structure, in these regions are concentrated this epeginetic marks in order to avoid deletions, insertion, translocations, transpositions or illegimate recombination, phenomena related with cancer. Hypomethylation of CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are related with cancer, maybe the DNMT1 have to do with the disruption of the methylation of this regions, becuase if this enzyme doesn't work well the methyl group can not incorporate to cytosines allow that mutagenesis occur easily. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele the ICE region is methylated spreading the methylation mark to the H19 gene because these are only 2 kb apart, then CTCF can not join to ICE allowing the passage of the enhancers to lfg12 promoting its transcription. On the other hand in the maternal allele, the ICE region doesn't have methyl groups therefore CTCF can binding to ICE creating a barrier to block the passage of the enhancers to lfg12 gene, so H19 is trancribed while lgf12 does not. Taking into account the above, the Wilm's tomour is produced by the overgrowth of the kidney cells mostly due to a epigenetic disruption for loss imprinting on the maternal allele who behave like a paternal allele.So the maternal allele adquire  methylation groups because its lose their imprimiting marks allow the lfg2 genes transcription.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the groups of DNA-demethylating agents wich means that works on regions that are over methylated, for example when the EZH2 has mutations it attaches methyl groups to histones more often than normally, is here where the decitabine blocks this enzime to avoid that more methyl groups will be attach to the histone, then the methyl groups level decreased avoiding that other near genes would be methylated overcoats those ones that are involved in supress the tumour genes so they are active not silencing to regulated the genes related with overgrowth and cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A sensitive perios is where the intrinsec or natural epigenetic marks are reprogramming so any agent that can alter even decrease or increase these marks could change all functions or structure of the region that is being reprogramming. Therefore exist two periods that are pretty sensitive to any agent ( chemical, enviromental) where the epigenetic marks are restablished, first one is the pre implantation period ( early development) because the zygote has become in a blastocyte, here cells need to begin to differentiate and the second one is when the primordial germ cell are developing. Then if the patterns of DNA methylation are changed during these two periods later these will be maintain troughout the development of the organism. So might not be appropriate treat patients during this sensitive periods supply them with agents that could change the epigenetics marks in these phases where the methyl groups could be attached or cleaned easily causing disruption in the DNA structure during the division cell or changes in the epigenetic DNA characteristics.</div>
