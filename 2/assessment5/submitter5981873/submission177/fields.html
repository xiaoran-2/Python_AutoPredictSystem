    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">At most locus CpG islands are unmethylated, DNA methylation at these sites can silence the normal expression of genes. If a CpG island is methylated, it may turn off the normal tumor suppressing elements of a cell (s). Normally intergenic regions and repetitive elements are silenced by DNA methylation, but in most cancer tissues it is noted that these sites are unmethylated.  The hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements cause the methyl silencing group on the genes to leave, and this expresses enhancers that may act on genes, overexpressing certain genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The maternal allele has a repressor bound at the imprinting control region at the IGF2 locus, resulting in silencing of the IGF2 gene. The paternal allele has methylation of the impriting region and genes at this locus, but the enhancers are able to act in the IGF2, promoting expression. In Wilm's tumor, both of the alleles (maternal and paternal) have methylation of both the imprinting regions, and thus, resembles two paternal alleles. Since the two paternal-like alleles  both express IGF2, this results in over expression of the IGF2 gene, and over expression of genes is a major factor in cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA de-methlylating agent. Decitabine causes de-methylation of genes, and is a solution to the hypermethlyation found in many cancers. If Decitabine de-methylates a tumor suppressing gene that is methylated, it may release the silencing on this gene and turn back on the normal tumor suppression in a cell (therefore stopping uncontrolled growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark, and epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, that is they are passed on to daughter cells and not erased for the life of the organism.. Two  sensitive periods during an organisms lifetime and times that would be best to avoid drugs that change epigenetic marks is during germ-line development, and early embryonic development. During these stages, the normal epigenetic markers are reset, and any environmental or diet during these periods can effect the cells for the rest of the organisms life. If we inhibit DNA methylation or acetylation during these periods, we will have phenotypic aberattions for the rest of the life of the organism, as these will imprint and pass on to subsequent cells..</div>
