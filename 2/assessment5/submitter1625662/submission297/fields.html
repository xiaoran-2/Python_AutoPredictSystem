    <div class="field-value">In cancer DNA methylation is altered in two ways: <br /><ol><li>(Hyper)-methylation of CpG islands</li><li>Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic intervals.<br /></li></ol>While in normal cells CpG islands are not methylated - and this is particularly true for CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes - it seems that in cancerous cells CpG islands are hypermethylated. Actually tumour suppressor hypermethylation seems to be more common than mutation. We must note however, that the type of hypermethylation depends on the kind of cancer. It can be that either a single gene's CpG islands are hypermethylated (like in retinoblastome, colorectal cancer, breast cancer) or CpG islands of a set of genes are hypermethylated (colorectal cancer, gliomas, neuroblastoma and others). By silencing the tumour suppressing genes, tumours continue to grow leading to cancer.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally hypermethylated in normal cells, while in cancer cells they are hypomethylated. This has been the first epigenetic abnormality found in history and it has been found that some king of hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is found in every kind of tumour. It seems this hypomethylation results to genomic instability which may mean that illegitimate recombinations may take place between repeats and that repeats and transpositions, as well as cryptic promoters of genes may be activated and neighboring genes may be disrupted. <br /><br />In general we see that when we have tumour suppressor hypermethylation tumours are grown, while in the case of intergenic regions / repetitive elements hypomethylation the chromosomal instability that results enhances tumorigenesis<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele in the H19/Igf2 cluster is normally hypermethylated and the Igf2 is not expressed, as it is supposed. In the maternal allele the cluster is normally hypomethylated and Igf2 should be expressed, however in a normal cell, due to imprinting only the paternal allele is concerned. Actually due to imprinting, the Igf2 expression depends on the paternal allele, while the H19 expression depends only on the maternal allele. In the case of Wilm's tumour a loss of imprinting occurs provoking the maternal allele that should be silent to become active and the gene to be expressed biallelically. This has as a result the de novo methylation of the cluster and the silencing of the maternal H19 allele. Igf2 is a very powerful growth factor for tumours, so if it expressed tumours tend to grow leading to cancer. As the paternal allele is methylated and only this is taken into account in normal cells, it doesn't provoke the tumour growth. But when the unmethylated maternal allele is taken into account tumours are helped into growing, provoking cancers that apart from Wilm's tumour include colorectal, ovarian etc. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, which means that this kind of drug is used to reduce the DNA methylation. So as the class name shows Decitabine makes hypermathylated DNA to become demethylated. As we have explained in Q1 DNA hypermethylation may cause the silencing of tumour suppressor genes, meaning that tumours are grown, so it is quite possible that by demethylating the CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes, the normal cells will start "attacking" tumours by trying to suppress them, and thus we get the anti-tumour effect expected by the drug. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">By altering the DNA methylation we actually alter the epigenetic state of the cancer cell. This means that this alteration is going to endure after the period of drug treatment because the epigenetic state is heritable to the daughter cells through mitosis. The fact that the epigenome is mitotically heritable makes the changes to DNA methylation provoked by the drugs to continue to last. This is particularly true in sensitive periods, periods that is that the epigenome is supposed to change, and the altered environment may affect the epigenetic control. Such periods are generally the pre-implantation period of the foetus and the period during which primordial germ cells are developed. It has been also been shown - as in the case of Oeverkalix - that the so called slow grow periods (9-12 years old for males and 8-10 years for females) when germ cells are developed, are also sensitive periods. <br /><br />So treating someone during a sensitive period with epigenetic drugs may change not only their epigenome, but also the epigenome of their offsprings. And as we do not yet have full knowledge of how these changes to epigenome act on normal cells it is advisable not to use them during sensitive periods.<br /></div>
