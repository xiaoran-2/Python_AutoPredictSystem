    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands could be found in more then a half of genes' promotors. Unlike in the rest of genome, those are usuallly non-methylated. In cancer they are mostly hypermethylated thus repressing the expression of corresponding gene. This is the way how cancer down-regulates the tumor supressing genes. Intragenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated in healthy organism. It provides genomic stability, preventing illegal chromosomes' interactions. In cancer cells these regions are mainly hypomethilated, so genome instability occurs. It results in illegimatic recombinations causing various chromosomal abberrations (translocations, inversions, delitions). Those, in turn, cause activation of cryptic promoters, disrupt some genes or produce fusion genes powerfully up- or down-regulating various signalling pathways. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the regulation of Igf2 expression takes part the imprint
control region (ICR) located between Igf2 and H19 genes. Downstream the enhancers are situated which can control both genes. The ICR is
methylated on the paternal allele, thus the enhancers can act on
IGF2, because CTCF is not binding to
inhibit this. So, Igf2 is expressed
from the pattern allele. This ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele, thus CTCF binds its insulator
element, and it means that the enhancers
in this case will act on H19 instead of Igf2.So, Igf2
will be silent for the maternal allele.However,
in cancer the loss of imprinting means the hypermethylation of the
imprint control region on the maternal
allele.So, on the
maternal allele, expression of Igf2 also appears.In such case there will be a double dose of Igf2 in comparison with normal cell. Igf2 is
growth factor, so it benefits the growth of tumor cells. It is
associated with Wilm's tumour. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is ahypomethilating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It functions by incorporating into DNA strands. Thus blocking the DNA methyltransferase function. Probably, with this treatment the repressed in tumor cell tumor-supressing genes could be re-activated so the ways of eliminating cancer cells will function again. These could be growth-restricting or pro-apoptotic genes.<br /></p><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation in normal genome has strict pattern providing genomic stability and coordinating gene expression pattern. In cancer a lot of anti-tumor genes are supressed due to abnormal hyprmethylation.  Hypomethylating agents in such case can first, directly re-actvate these genes, second, by incorporation in DNA itself they can interfere with the DNA synthesis (thus stopping cell division) or with the RNA synthesis (thus causing abnormal gene expression which can lead to apoptosis).<br />There are two period in the ontogenesis when the genome is highly sencitive to any disturbancies in methylation pattern. These are in embryogenesis and in germ-line establishing. Thus it should be thoughtfull and <span>informed decision of both the clinician and the patient whether or not these drugs should be given to the pregnant woman or a girl. It always will be a choice in favour of mother or potential child. </span>The embryo from the mother treated with such agents is likely to have chromosomal abnormalities and growth defects.<br /></div>
