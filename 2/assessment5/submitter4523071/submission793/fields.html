    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands, which are normally unmethylated, are sequences
of DNA rich in CG dinucleotides. These islands are often involved in the
initiation of transcription by associating with promoters.  In cancer cells, CpG islands are more likely
to be hypermethylated, particularly in the promoters of tumor suppressing
genes. The methylation of these CpG islands leads to silencing of these tumor
suppressing genes, contributing to cancer.</p>

<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically
highly methylated, which helps to maintain genomic stability and prevent
transposition of repeats.  In cancer
cells, intergenic regions and especially repetitive elements tend to be
hypomethylated. This leads to features of genomic instability, such as
reciprocal translocations, activation of cryptic promoters, and activating
transpositions of repetitive elements. This genomic instability, as well as
hypomethylation near the promoters at particular genes, can contribute to
cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting can lead to differences in the expression of
particular genes based on which copy was inherited from which parent, including those involved in tumor suppression or growth
factors. In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is methylated at the
imprint control region, which prevents the CTCF insulator from binding and
allows expression of Igf2. The maternal allele is not methylated at the imprint
control region, allowing CTCF to bind and the enhancers to activate transcription
of H19 (but Igf2 is not expressed).  In
Wilm’s tumor, both alleles (maternal and paternal) are methylated (due to
hypermethylation), which leads to expression of Igf2 on both alleles (twice the
normal dose). Since Igf2 is growth promoting, doubling the expression of this
gene contributes to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is in a class of epigenetic inhibitors called
DNA-demethylating agents. As the name of the class suggests, Decitabine leads
to demethylation of DNA.  In particular,
Decitabine reverses the methylation of histones which are methylated through
the action of an enzyme called EZH2. When EZH2 is overactive, it leads to the
overmethylation and silencing of tumor-suppressing genes. Decitabine
counteracts this methylation, leading to an anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, can be
passed on during cell division.  This
means that an alteration of DNA methylation via epigenetic drugs will have a
lasting effect on the epigenome through mitosis. A sensitive period refers to a
particular stage of development or growth that is particularly responsive to either
internal or environmental factors. Two sensitive periods of development in the
mammalian system are primordial germ cell development and gametogenesis, during
which extensive reprogramming of epigenetic state can be affected by the
environment. Since so much reprogramming occurs during sensitive periods,
treating during these periods is dangerous because it can affect much more than
just the tumors that are the targets of the drugs, particularly if the drugs
affect epigenetic reprogramming.</p></div>
