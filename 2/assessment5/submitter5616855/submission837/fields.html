    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Decitabine</strong> is a DNMT inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogue which is incorporated into the DNA through replication. When DNMT binds to the analogue in order to restore the DNA methylation pattern, it binds to it irreversibly and cannot be released eventually inhibiting its function. DNA methylation is disrupted and most likely hypermethylation of CpG islands (CGI), which is associated with Myelodysplastic Syndrome, where Decitabine as therapy. Decitabine's <strong>anti-tumour effec</strong>t is associated with the disruption of the DNA methylation pattern that probably causes the cancer, eventually:<br /><ul><li> restoring genomic stability caused by CGI hypermethylation mainly, and</li><li> the expression of tumour-suppressor genes whose promoters are located at the hypermethylated CGI regions. <br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><b>CpG islands</b> are normally NOT methylated, independently of their activity state (active or inactive), since DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark associated with gene silencing, and CpG islands usually contain the promoters of genes important for a normal cell's life cycle. In cancer, CpG islands become hypermethylaed leading to genomic instability and γενε silencing. Genomic instability then leads to loss or gain of DNA (e.g. translocations, deletions etc.) and hypermethylation of CpG islands can lead to gene silencing of tumour-suppressor genes, which can lead to the cell's proliferation and continuum of division, therefore becoming a tumour. <br />Inversely, <b>intergenic regions</b> and <b>repetitive elements</b> are normally methylated, avoiding any transcriptional "noise" by alternative start sites or inhibiting antisense transcription. In cancer, these areas become hypomethylated. Once again hypomethylation of the particular regions lead to genomic instability through illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposons and last by activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes (transcriptional "noise"). Again, all that transcriptional "noise" or the antisense transcription as well can lead to gene silencing through transcription of siRNAs. Furthermore, these regions usually transcript to lncRNAs which might act<i> in trans</i>  or <i>in cis </i>silencing any neighboring genes. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">At the<strong> H19/Igf2 imprinted locus</strong>, the H19 gene is maternally expressed while the Igf2 is paternally expressed. The differerence is the methylation or not of the ICR at the locus. At the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated so CTCF binds with it therefore silencing Igf2's expression and allowing H19 expression. Inversely, at the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, so CTCF cannot bind and Igf2 is expressed unlike H19 which is silenced. In Wilm's tumour Igf2 is over-expressed due to hypermethylation of the ICR at both alleles. Igf2 is an oncogene, therefore it's over-expression leads to cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A <strong>sensitive period </strong>is a period when alterations in the environment may have an effect on epigenetic control. <strong>One</strong> is the period from primordial germ cell development till the production of mature gametes (eggs, sperm) and the <strong>other</strong> is the period between pre-implantation and early post-implantation of the zygote. Both periods are involved in the active remodelling of the epigenome, so any alteration in the environment,e.g. drug treatment for a specific disease, might  have an enduring effect on it since any epigenetic change is passed on during cell division to daughter cells until it is established. This is also why,  alterations in DNA methylation are sustained through time and can last beyond the period of drug treatment. So, it is inadvisable to treat a patient with a drug that alters DNA methylation during a sensitive period. Patients that can't be treated with that kind of drugs are children with malignancies, who are still developing mature gametes. Any alteration in the DNA methylation pattern because of the drug will be passed on to the next generation or the next-next generation and could be dangerous for the offspring (transgeneration epigenetic inheritance).<br /><br /></div>
