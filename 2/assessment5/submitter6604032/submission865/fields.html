    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation refers to the addition of a
methyl group to the 5th carbon in the cytosine base of DNA and is associated
with silencing of gene expression. Methylated CpGs are bound by methylated-CpG
binding proteins such as MeCP1 and MeCP2, which along with other recruited
factors, can lead to condensation of chromatin. In normal cells, most
promoters, inspite of having a high CpG density, are kept free of DNA
methylation irrespective of their active state. However, CpG islands at intergenic
regions and repetitive sequences are hypermethylated. This occurs to ensure the
genomic stability of the cells. DNA methylation at intergenic regions ensures
that cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites are silenced. DNA
methylation at repetitive elements occurs to prevent transposition or unwanted
recombinations. Silencing of these repeats also prevent unwanted transcription
of neighbouring genes by strong promoters present in the repeats.</span></p>

<p><span>Cancer cells, on the other hand, are
associated with genome-wide hypomethylation and a regional gain of
hypermethylation. The CpG islands on promoters become hypermethylated, thereby
resulting in the silencing of the corresponding genes. And if these genes
happen to be a tumour suppressor gene such as genes involved in cell cycle,
apoptosis or DNA repair, then silencing of the gene contributes to one of hits
of the Knudson hypothesis. DNA hypermethylation of genes such as <i>RB, MLH1, BRCA1 </i>and <i>MGMT </i>are known to occur in retinoblastoma, colorectal cancer,
breast cancer and gliomas, respectively. High levels of aberrant DNA
hypermethylation at CpG sites referred to as CpG island methylator phenotype
(CIMP) can be found in colorectal cancer, glioma or breast cancer. Aberrant
hypermethylation of CpG island shores (i.e. 2kb region surrounding CpG islands),
is also associated with cancer. Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic
regions can be seen in cancer which can result in genomic instability.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Aberrant DNA methylation at imprint control regions (ICR) can result in
loss of growth restrictive genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes; either
of which can lead to tumorigenesis. In case of H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is un-methylated
in the maternal allele. This allows an insulator protein, CTCF to bind to the
ICR, thereby insulating the neighbouring Igf2 gene, which is involved in
promoting growth. Hence, Igf2 is insulated from the effect of downstream
enhancers. Instead, the enhancers act on H19 gene and enhance its expression.
Therefore, Igf2 is silenced in the maternal allele. On the other hand, the ICR
in the paternal allele is methylated, thereby preventing the binding of CTFC to
it. This allows Igf2 expression to be activated by the downstream enhancers.
The methylation of ICR also results in silencing of the neighbouring H19 gene due
to heterochromatin spreading. In Wilm’s tumour, there is an aberrant
hypermethylation of ICR at the maternal allele just as seen in the paternal
allele. This results in loss of imprinting and subsequent biallelic expression
of Igf2, thereby causing an increase in the Igf2 levels, which ultimately leads
to increased cell growth as seen in Wilm’s tumour.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA de-methylating
agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia. It is
a cytosine nucleoside analog and functions as a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor.
Decitabine is incorporated into the DNA and irreversibly binds to it, where it
is recognized by DNMT. This results in degradation of DNMT. The action of Decibatine
in DNA de-methylation is replication dependent since DNA methylation is diluted
out by subsequent replications. Decibatine produces anti-tumour effects by
reverting genes that had been silenced due to hypermethylation. This can result
in reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor genes and other
cancer-related genes. The reversion of these epigenetic mutations can result in
upregulation of cell-cycle associated genes and apoptosis-inducing genes. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The alterations in DNA methylation were able
to produce enduring effects on the epigenome due to the heritable nature of DNA
methylation. These changes can be passed onto subsequent cells following cell division
and hence the effects are able to persist even after the period of drug
treatment. These epigenetic changes exist until they are actively removed and
once removed, they do not come back, thereby providing more lasting effects. Sensitive
period is a period when the cell is more susceptible to epigenetic
aberrations/changes as a result of environmental changes such as exposure to the
therapeutic drug. The two sensitive periods of development are the pre-implantation
period and primordial germ cell development period. Treating patients during
sensitive periods would be inadvisable because during these periods the cells
are most vulnerable and can accumulate harmful, lasting epigenetic changes.
Moreover, the effect of epigenetic therapy on the germ cells of the patient,
especially young patients need to be considered.</span></p></div>
