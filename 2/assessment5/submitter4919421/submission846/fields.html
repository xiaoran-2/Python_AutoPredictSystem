    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA
methylation can be altered trough hypo- and hyper methylation. In normal
function the methylation of a CpG Island turns a gene off. With hypo
methylation the gene that is supposed to be off will be turned on because the gene isn't methylated and the therfore can be translated. When that gene is turned on there will be more translation of that
gene then the cell needs or the cell will divide more and that will result in cancer.
Intergenic regions are regions that can regulate genes by binding molecules
that would start a translation. Repetitive elements are important in the cell
and have a lot of CpG islands. If the intergenic regions and repetitive
elements are hypo methylated the result can be in the form of uncontrollable cell
growth. By erasing the methylated CpG islands the genes can be translated and there
could be too much translation of that specific gene translation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
paternal allele is methylated and that means it will promote cell growth. The maternal
allele is unmethylated therefore it will not promote cell growth. If the father
allele will be unmethylated it will not promote cell growth and the cell will
not grow. If the maternal and paternal allele is methylated there will be a
double cell growth which will result in cancer. In a Wilm’s tumour the H19 gene
is hyper methylated which causes cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">Decitabine
is a drug that treats myelodysplastic syndromes. Myelodysplastic syndromes are precursors
of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. Its
incorporation into DNA leads to a covalent binding with DNA methyltransferases,
which prevents DNA synthesis and subsequent cytotoxicity. Decitabine functions
in the same manner as Azacitidine. Azacitidine gets incorporated in the DNA for
a cytosine. Then it Blocks a reaction of an enzyme that helps in the methylation
of the DNA</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering
DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because of heritability
of the methylation. If a methylation is heritable the effects can be given to
the daughter and granddaughter cell. This can lead to changing the methylation “forever”.
A sensitive period is a period where drugs can affect more than the parts that
it is aimed at. Sensitive periods can be kids that are growing and people with
a low immune system. It could also mean people who have adverse effects against
drugs. Treating these patients is inadvisable because the drugs can cause more
damage than it can cure</p></div>
