    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation
occurs at CpG denucletides, and is mitotically inheritable.  In a normal situation CpG islands areas tend
to be unmethylated in vivo, but are found to be methylated in tumor tissues. So
changes in the pattern of DNA methylation have been a consistent finding in
cancer cells and interestingly found more often in all cancers than genetic
mutations.In a cancer situation disruptions of DNA methylation occurs in two different
ways. Locus specific DNA hypermethilation and the earliest epigenetic
aberration which was a genome-wide lack of methylation (Genome-wide
hipomethylation). </span></p>

<p>Focusing on
DNA hypermathilation, it acts in CpG island repressing transcription of the promoter regions of tumor suppressor
genes leading to gene silencing in càncer. <span>There is a high incidence of C-to-T transitions
in tumor supressors attributed to the spontaneous deamination of
5-methylcytosine. This hypermethylation increased with age and time so  as the tissue passes through different stages
of cancer hiperpasia  neoplasia and
finally reach metastasis or invasion the number of DNA methylation increases.</span></p>

<p>On the
other hand DNA hipomethylation is also found in intergenic regions and repetitive
elements which tend to be methylated as well. Therefor in a normal situation
both of them are methylated while in a cancer cell these regions tend to be
hipomethylated. </p>

<p><span>At <u>intergenic
regions and repetitive elements</u> DNA methylations acts maintaining genomic
integrity or stability (silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic
splice sites. Although the function of DNA methylation in these regions is to
maintain stability, in a cancer situation this stability is disrupted resulting
in deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If a drug is able to modify the activity of an enzyme which lays down
mitotycally-heritable epigenetic marks such as methylation,this can produce
long-term effects in the gene expression of an organism. <span><br /><span>First of all DNA methylation is newly laid down
by DNMT3 and maintained during mitosis by DNMT1. </span><br />
DNMT1 methylates hemi-methylated DNA acting
on the the CpG sites complementary to the originally methylated CpGs.<br /><span>This maintainance of DNA methylation is
essential because it provides it with the capability of being heritable by
daughter cells during mitosis and therefore it can become lifelong. However,
during sensitive periods such as gametogenesis
or early embryonic development, the levels of DNA
methylation decrease because an active reprogramming period is being carried.
In these periods the old methyl groups are removed an others newly
added. Another period which could be more sensitive to treatments is
adolescence (around 12 for girls and 14 for boys) because new methyl groups are
actively being added and it constitutes the last sensitive period of
"early" development. In all these periods, drugs could play a
decisive role in the future of the new organism by modifying this process,
therefore it is recommendable to avoid treatments which modify DNA
methylation</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the
common features of cancer cells is they display loss of imprinting. They became
expressed or silenced for both parental allele. Hence, alterations in DNA
methylations at ICR(imprinted control regions)can result in loss of expression
of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>

<p>Focusing on
H19/Igf2 cluster it is known as a case of disruption of imprinting controled by
an enhancer blocker. In a normal cell it is paternal imprinted meaning that the
paternal allele it’s methylated in the ICR while the maternal allele is unmethylated. </p><p>In the Maternal
allele the ICR is unmethylated allowing its bound to an insulation protein called CTCF. This protein is able to insulate CTCF binding insulates Igf2
from the downstream enhancers and silencing Igf2. Moreover these enhancers are
able to activate the expression of the long non coding RNA called H19. In the
paternal allele ICR is methylated so CTCF can no longer bind to it so the
enhancers are free to act in the Igf2. This methylation spread to the H19
promoter silencing this gene.</p>

<p><span>In Wilm’s
tumor there is a hypermethylation of ICR in both maternal and paternal allele and
a consequence loss of imprinting. This causes an Igf2 overexpression. Igf2 is a
growth promoter which will contribute to cancer especially to kidney tumours.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a
nucleoside that inhibits DNMT(DNA metil transferase). It is being used as a drug inhibitor in Myelodysplasic
syndrom which progresses to Acute myeloyd leukemia. This drug belongs to two
different categories; it is a demethylation agent as well as an antimetabolite.
As a demethylation agent it will decrease the methylation levels by inhibiting
the DNMT. This will in turn fight against cancer because in tumors we find
epigenetic abnormalities as hypermetilation in CpG islands which block the
activity of suppressor genes. By this
process of demethylation, (5-Aza-CdR nucleotide of DNA forms a covalent bond
with the DNMT and inactivates these enzymes(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15313416" title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15313416">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15313416</a> )<span> normal function to the
tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. On
the other hand when the cells incorporate antimetabolites into the cellular
metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a
direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of dividing cancer cells.</span></p></div>
