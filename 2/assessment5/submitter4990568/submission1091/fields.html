    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, CpG islands are mostly hypomethylated. In cancer cells, however, more CpG islands are methylated, and this is how tumor suppressor genes are silenced. Because these methylations are mitotically heritable, and these cells are likely to devide faster or die less frequently, this opens the door to the growing of cancer. In a normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are very likely to be methylated. In a cancer cell, these are less likely to be methylated. The hypomethylation happens very early in the development of cancer, and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements of these cells become less methylated over time. This hypomethylation contributes to cancer by (1) making recombination between repeats more likely, because the DNA is less tightly packaged, (2) the activation of repeats and their jumping to other regions, and (3) causing more transcription of the surrounding regions because of either the activation of their promoters or the jumping of the repeats to other regions. So overall, the genome becomes more instable.<br /><br />Source: Coursera lectures on epigenetics by Marnie Bewitt<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer by either transcription of both parental alleleles or silencing of both parental alleles, when normally one parental allele would be expressed. In the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster, normally the paternal H19 control region is methylated, while the maternal H19 control region is silenced. This means the enhancers can only act on the paternal Igf2 allele, which is then not insulated by CTCF, and so is expressed, and the maternal Igf2 allele is not. With Wilm's tumour, however, both parental H19 control regions are methylated, which means both parental Igf2 alleles are expressed. This contributes to cancer by, through having two times the normal amount of transcription of Igf2, enhancing the growth of the cell, because Igf2 is growth promoting.<br /><br />Source: Coursera lectures on epigenetics by Marnie Bewitt<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, which means it demethylates DNA. It can have an anti-tumour effect by treating myelodysplastic syndromes, which are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.<br /><br />Source: "Cancer's epicentre" in The Economist<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, because they are mitotically heritable. However, it would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming, which occurs during premordial germ cell development and after fertilisation. If patients would be treated during these periods, establishing normal methylation patterns might be seriously disturbed, which may result in abnormal development of the embryo (when the patient is treated during epigenetic reprogramming in early development), or infertility of the person or abnormal development of the person's children (when the patient is treated during epigenetic reprogramming of the premordial germ cells).<br /><br />Sources: Coursera lectures on epigenetics by Marnie Bewitt and  "Cancer's epicentre" in The Economist<br /><br /><br /></div>
