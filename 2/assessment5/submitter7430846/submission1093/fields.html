    <h1>Submission 1093 from Anon (session_user_id: fc749fc12b96a790303e2ad006a20c7c7452fa75)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation, as an epigenetic mark, is mitotically heritable; so that provides an opportunity for change to last more than just during a life of  affected cell - it will affect several generations of that cell.<br />However, altering methylation state, or any other epigenetic state, is not always indicative in humans - any living organism actually. This is because there are certain periods during development when cells are forming (laying down) epigenetic marks, like during early development and premordial germ cell development, but also within some periods during child's development.<br />Given that drugs altering epigenetic state are not "site specific" - meaning, they don't exert their effect only on neoplastic tissue - administering such therapeutic agent during aforementioned sensitive periods could (with most likely very high probability) lay down epigenetic marks throughout the forming tissues and alter epigenome (maybe consequently altering genome too) and therefore altering gene expression. And this would probably result in adverse outcome from initial intention - curing.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of genomic imprinting, in terms of cancerogenesis, can be either due to hypomethylation or hypermethylation of imprint control regions, not occurring on the same region of course. In the instance of H19/Igf2 cluster what happens in cancerogenesis is hypermethylation.<br /><br />Normally, imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on paternal allele, which leaves it unmethylated on maternal allele.<br />What happens is that at the paternal allele an insulating protein cannot bind to its site on ICR leaving Igf2 an open target for gene expression enhancers. Opposite happens on maternal allele - insulating protein attaches to its site on ICR and protects Igf2 from those enhancers, meaning that no expression from Igf2 will occur.<br /><br />Now, as loss of imprinting often happens in cancerogenesis, and in partnership with hypermethylation, what happens is that ICR on maternal allele gets methylated too; leading to expression of Igf2. Given that this now makes twofold dose of expression of Igf2-specific genes, which have effect in promoting growth, this can lead to cancer overgrowth, or at least stimulation of its growth. And this overexpression of Igf2 is a feature of Wilm's tumour.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Therapeutic agent "Decitabine" belongs to a group of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.<br />During cell reproduction, when DNA is replicated, it gets embodied in DNA strand. So when DNA methyltransferase 1 comes to lay down methylation on a daughter strand it gets permanently attached to inhibitor molecule and therefore that site on DNA strand doesn't get methylated.<br />So, given that DNA methylation is often present in tumours (as their cause), by disabling heritability of this mark in subsequent generations of a neoplastic cell, tumour suppression is a likely outcome.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands is usually attributed to silencing of expression of gene on which that promoter is located on.<br />In cancer, what often occurs is hypermethylation of  CpG islands at tumour suppressor genes. And having said that this type of epigenetic mark is often associated with repression of gene expression, this way tumour's cell "growth control" is turned off so they can rapidly replicate.<br />At intergenic regions and repetitive elements underlying problem with DNA methylation in cancerogenesis is due to hypomethylation which causes genome to become unstable, which normally doesn't occur because those regions are heavily methylated.<br /></div>
