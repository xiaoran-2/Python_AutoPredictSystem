    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">At CpG islands, they have a high CpG density and are not methylated in their active states usually. While in a cancer cell, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. The increasing DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, which will makes cells divide more rapidly, not die as much and so on and finally contributes to cancer. Repetitive elements are usually methylated through the intergenic regions. However,In a cancer cell, they will be hypomethylated. This will lead to illegitimation recombination between repeats because they are not densely packaged. They can also be activated by hypermethylation and they will have many copies. Some of them willjump around the genome, disrupting the coding region of a gene and activating neighbouring genes. So there will be additional deletions and insertion and also reciprocal translocations and finally contributes to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, the control region is methylated so CTCF can not bind on it. And then the enhancers will promote igf2. Also, the methylation of control region will spread so H19 will be methylated ,too. In the maternal allele, the imprinted control region is unmethylated so CTCF binds to it. CTCF will block the preferred loop between enhancers and igf2 and then the enhancers loop to H19. As a result, H19 is promoted and lgf2 is not.  <br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">It's similar to azacitidine. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltansferase. It can be incorporated into DNA strands and decrease DNA methylation. It belongs to DNMT.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Increasing DNA methylation can make some genes less expressed. During the sensitive period, it is forming something and it's sensitive to other factors. Sensitive period of development is a period during which is easy to be worse of better. </div>
