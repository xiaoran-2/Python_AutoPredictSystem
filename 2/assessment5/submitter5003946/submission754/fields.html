    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally at CpG islands DNA is unmethylated. In cancer, the CpG islands are methylated. DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation to silence tumor suppressor genes in cancer. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and according to the Knudson hypothesis multiple hits on the DNA are required. Tumor suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutations and it increases by age. Normally in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA is methylated. In cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Input control region is methylated in paternal allele. Therefore the  enhancers can act of Igf 2 as CTCF cannot bind to the later element due to methylation of inpur control region. And hence Igf2 is expressed from paternal allele. On the other hand input control region is unmethylated in meternal allele. As a result, CTCF will bind to the later element. Enhancers will act on H 19 but Igf2 will be silenced from the maternal allele. In Wilm's tumor, loss of imprinting leads to hypermethylation of input control region on maternal allele and so there is expression of IGF2. Now, Igf2 is growth promoting in nature and associated with Wlim's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA methyl transferase inhibitors and it is FDA approved. It is used to treat progression of Myelodysplasia syndrome to Acute myeloid leukemia. Nucleoside analogues irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, therefore is replication dependent. Its mechanism of action is still unclear. Decitabine causes DNA demethylation, thereby killing tumor cells. It does that by inhibiting hypermethylation of CpG islands.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
