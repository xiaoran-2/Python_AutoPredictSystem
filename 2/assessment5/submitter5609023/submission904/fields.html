    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in ~60% of promoters, and they are
normally not methylated. The methylation of these promoter CpG islands can lead
to the silencing of their underlying genes. In cancer cells, however, CpG
islands are often seen hypermethylated, which leads to the silencing of genes
important for maintaining normal cell functions, including tumor suppressor
genes.  </p>

<p>Quite the opposite of CpG islands, intergenic regions and
repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells but unmethylated in
cancer cells. In normal cells, the methylation of intergenic regions and
repetitive elements helps to maintain genome integrity; while in cancer cells,
the intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated, which
contributes to the genomic instability seen in cancer. </p>

<p>Taken together, in cancer, overall the genome is
hypomethylated with the exception of CpG islands which are hypermethylated.
These facts are exactly opposite to what have been found in normal cells and
hence can serve as a hall mark for cancer. This aberrant methylation pattern in
cancer is mechanistically significant because the hypomethylation of intergenic
regions and repeptitive elements removes an essential layer of genomic defense
against mutation, while the hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands,
especially in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, renders the cell prone
to uncontrolled proliferation and accumulation of mutations. The fact that DNA
methylation is mitotically heritable makes it possible for cancer cells to
rapidly evolve and epigenetically develop malignant traits to evade the
surveillance of normal machinery and outgrow into tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster serves as an imprinting control region
via mechanism of enhancer blocking. There is a DNA
methylation site between the Igf2 and H19 genes, where an insulator protein
CTCF can bind if it is not methylated. When CTCF binds to this site, the
downstream enhancers will be ‘insulated’ from Igf2 gene; and hence Igf2 will
not be expressed. When this site becomes methylated, the CTCF protein can no
longer bind, and the enhancers can access the Igf2 gene, leading to Igf2 activation.
Meanwhile, DNA methylation will spread to
H19 promoter to silence H19 expression. Note that Igf2 is an oncogene and
promotes growth.</p>

<p>This imprinting site is methylated on the paternal allele,
but not methylated on the maternal allele. Consequently, the Igf2 gene is
silenced on the maternal allele and is activated on the paternal allele; while H19
is only produced from the maternal allele. 
In Bechwith Wiedemann syndrome, both alleles behave like the paternal
allele, either due to loss of imprinting or uniparental disomy, leading to loss
of Cdkn1c and overdose of Igf2. Under this situation, patients may show large
tongue, fetal/postnatal overgrowth, and are predisposibal to embryonic or
childhood tumors, such as Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, also known as Decogen, is a DNA-demethylating
agent, used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, precursors of AML.
Decitabine is a chemical analogue of 2’-deoxy-cytidine. Because of this
structural similarity, Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA
methyltransferase. Treatment of Decitabine can lead to DNA
hypomethylation due to passive loss of DNA
methylation marks over mitosis. Under high dosage, on the other hand,
Decitabine may be incorporated into DNA
during replication and induce cell death. Both effects can contribute to the
anti-tumor effect of Decitabine. From an epigenetics point of view, this
compound interferes with cancer cell’s ability in maintaining its DNA
methylation pattern across mitosis, which is essential for the survival of
daughter cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is
mitotically heritable, and altered DNA
methylation patterns can be passed on to daughter cells. Therefore, treatment
of DNA methylation modifying agents can have
lasting effect. While most normal tissue does not undergo mitosis and may be
less affected compared with cancer tissue, certain parts of our body or certain
periods in our lifetime may be greatly affected by these treatments.</p>

<p>A sensitive period is a time frame of active epigenetic
reprogramming, when altered environments can have effects on epigenetic
control. There are two sensitive periods: one is from primordial germ cell
development to the gametes production; the other is preimplantation and early
postimplantation period. Epigenetic marks are actively remodeled during these
periods genomewide. Additionally, there are short sensitive time windows in the
development of certain organ or tissue.</p>

<p>It is not advisable to treat patients using epigenetic modifying
agents during these sensitive periods, because first, proper epigenetic
reprogramming in these periods are essential for the development, and treatment
in this period may cause undesired or detrimental consequences in the patient;
second, the two major sensitive periods have great impact on reproduction and
treatment in these periods will lead to consequences found in next generation.</p></div>
