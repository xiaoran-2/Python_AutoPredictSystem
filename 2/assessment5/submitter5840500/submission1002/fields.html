    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are normally hypomethylated but become hypermethylated, in general, within cancer cells. This leads to the frequent silencing of tumor suppressor genes and can be mitotically heritable. This proves detrimental in fast dividing cancer cells. In addition, the methylation of CpG islands tends to increase with time which as a result, increases the progress of cancer cells within an organism. Since DNA CpG island hypermethylation is more prevalent in cancer cells, this can be used as a sensitive biomarker to detect, define, and track the progress of cancer. Conversely, there is a prevalence of hypomethylation at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements of DNA in cancer cells. Non-cancerous DNA tends to display a degree of methylation as a normal part of gene expression.The absence of this methylation is an indicator that the cell is not functioning as intended and can lead to the expression of oncogenes. This decrease in methylation leads to genomic instability due to the increase in repeats and cryptic promoter activation. These disruptions of normal activity can lead to deletion and insertion of genomic information as well as detrimental reciprocal translocations. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting either due to hypo- or hypermethylation of the imprinted gene can cause cancer due to the loss of growth restricting genes, or the over-expression of normally suppressed genes. In the example of H19/lgf2, within a normal cell - the paternal allele is methylated at the imprint control gene which supresses the activation of the H19 gene and allows the enhancers to activate lgf2. Conversely, the maternal imprint control  gene is not methylated and allows for the binding of CTCF that initiates the downstream enhancers to activate the H19 gene. In the case of a Wilm's tumor, both parental alleles are methylated at the imprint control site, thereby restricting the activation of H19 entirely and overproducing lgf2. Since imprinted genes are normally responsible for growth promoting genes, unregulated expression is likely to lead to cancer growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The cancer drug Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyl-transferase inhibitors. This drug inserts into the DNA during replication and binds the DNMT1 permanently. Since cancer cells tend to replicate more rapidly than normal cells, the drug affects them more acutely. Since this drug increases DNA demethylation , tumor suppressing genes are more highly expressed and therefore have an anti-tumor effect. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation via the epigenetic machinery can have enduring effects of the epigenome since the changes are replicated and passed down the cell's linage during division until they are actively erased. While these changes remain active in cells, the cancer suppressing factors continue to work without the need to remove the cancerous cell entirely. On the other hand, during sensitive periods, or times where cell replication is necessary for the long term viability of the individual such as childhood or the production of an embryo, such changes may be detrimental rather than than beneficial. Since at this time, the drug cannot target specific cells or specific genes, instead can affect all cells treated, some of these changes may be passed down to offspring or interrupt normal non-cancerous cell development. As stated above, these changes remain active until they are actively erased and growth suppressing genes would not be a benefit to a growing child or embryo that requires as much growth as required. </div>
