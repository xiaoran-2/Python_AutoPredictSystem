    <div class="field-value">Normal function of DNA methylation is regulation of gene expression. DNA methylation is usually responsible for gene silencing. In cancer general wide genome methylation is depleted, but methylation at CpG islands is elevated. These epigenetic mutations are alternatives to DNA mutations. CpG islands are usually situated at gene promoters. In cancer a common epigenetic mutation is methylation of CpG islands in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, which leads to silencing the expression of the gene. Tumour suppressor hypermethylation is often more
frequent than mutations. These hypermethylated regions can play a role of a biomarker, which means that a certain DNA region is hypermethylated in a cancer cell of a certain type of cancer and hypomethylated in a normal cell. They have already found some biomarkers that act like this. These biomarkers can reveal you the type of cancer, the prognosis and can inform you about the treatment. Also CpG island shores are hypermethylated in cancer. Overall, DNA hypermethylation can result in loss of expression of growth
restricting genes, which is a common, early event, often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue.<br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and in repetitive elements is also regulation of DNA expression. We do not need the intergenic and repetitive elements to be expressed, so we silence them with methyl groups. With DNA methylation we also prevent the repetitive elements to transpose from one region of the genome to the other. Genome wide methylation is usually lowered in cancer cells (hypomethylation), which is the reason for genome instability (illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes (c.f. Avy and Axinfu <span>alleles))</span> in cancer cells. DNA hypomethylation in CpG poor promoters can also lead to oncogene activation, but this is less common.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele of H19/Igf2 cluster the ICR is usually hypermethylated and this methylation also spreads to the H19 promoter. This means that the enhancers can act on the Igf2 gene and they can upregulate the expression of this Igf2 gene. H19 is in this case silenced because of the methylation. On the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated, which means that also the H19 gene is not methylated. With this methylation missing the CTCF can bind to the ICR, which physically prevents the enhancers to upregulate the expression of Igf2 gene and so H19 gene is upregulated. In Wilm's tumour is the maternal ICR also methylated, which means that it comes to over expression of Igf2 gene. Igf2 is a growth promoting hormone during gestation and so it promotes growth of cells. This type of cancer usually occurs at a very young age.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In terms of treatment epigenetic mutations have advantages compared to DNA sequence mutations, because they are reversible. Companies are already developing new cancer drugs, that act in a DNA-demethylating manner. One of these is decitabine (DNA-demethylating agent). It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Chemically, it is a cytidine analog, i<span>t hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. <br />There is also another hypomethylating agent already known, which is called </span><span>azacitidine. <br />Researchers are not just acting on DNA methylation but also on histone modifications, such as histone </span>acetylation. Histone-deacetylase inhibitors are also already in development. They <span>are being used to treat a rare illness called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. <br />Above mentioned strategies of cancer treatment can also be used in combination and this system of treatment was already successful even in solid tumours.<br />Both mentioned ways of acting on epigenetic alterations are already FDA approved.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. So, this is the reason for this type of treatment having the enduring effect on the epigenome. <span>It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.<br />Sensitive period is a time when epigenome is being formed. This happens during early development and during primordial germ cell development. These are the two stages when methylation is erased (actively or passively) and then restored de novo by DNMT3A and DNMT3B, so this is the sensitive period. <br />I would not recommend the kind of treatment that acts on epigenome </span>forming during the early development and during PGC development, which means I would not recommend this to pregnant women. The epigenome must be formed correctly in order to maintain life, so there must not be any epigenome alterating agents involved during the sensitive period.</div>
