    <h1>Submission 967 from Anon (session_user_id: 567cdbfc3a9a40e9a4d52c0d2213262b13798063)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br /><p>Most cancers have some epigenetic changes associated with
them and these changes are reversible. Altering DNA methylation to treat cancer
can have lasting effects on the daughter cells that arise from the cells that
were treated. And since epigenetics marks are carried on to the daughter cells,
treating the parent cells ensures that the DNA methylation marks are inherited
by the daughter cells as well.</p>

<p>Sensitive period during development is the time when the
body is more responsive to environmental via epigenetic effects.</p>

<p>During human development the sensitive period would be  during primordial germ cell development and
production of gametes, early pre implantation and post implantation or active
reprogramming of the epigenetic marks.  </p>

<p>Treating patients during the sensitive periods may result in
transgenerational inheritance of effects, which might affect individuals of
subsequent generations differently from their parents because of the
environment or stress. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br /><p>In vertebrates, CpG islands typically
occur at or near the transcription start site of genes, particularly
housekeeping genes. CpG islands within promoters are usually kept
methylation free and methylation of these regions represses gene expression in
mammalian systems. In cancer DNA methylation of CpG islands is increased or the
CpG islands are hypermethylated, thus silencing gene expression.</p>

<p>Hypomethylation of CpG islands lead to overexpression of
cancer-related genes. Therefore, in cancer hyper or hypo methylation of genes
causes aberrant gene expression.</p>

<p>Methylation is also found at intragenic regions and repeat
elements. In cancer these regions are hypomethylated, the effect of hypomethylation
depnds on the location of the repeats. Hypomethylation makes the genome instable
and leads to illegitimate recombination, activation of repeats and cryptic
promoters and splice sites, deletions and disruptions of neighbouring genes. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br /><p>In paternal allele, the ICR (and the downstream H19 locus)
is methylated and CTCF cannot bind to it and block the enhancers from
activating Igf2, so the Igf2 is active (or expressed) while in the maternal
allele, the ICR is unmethylated and CTCF can bind and because it is an
insulator protein it prevents the enhancers from binding to the IGf2 promoter
. Therefore in a maternal allele Igf2 is  turned off or remains silenced.</p>

<p>Hypermethylation of Igf2, ICR leads to Wilm's tumor.<br /></p>

<p>Disruption/loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 locus leads to
loss of silencing of the Igf2 promoter resulting in production of too much Igf2
, which is growth promoting or oncogenic.<br /></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br /><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor. Decitabine
is a nucleoside analog which when incorporated in DNA binds the DNA methyl
transferase enzyme irreversibly and blocks its function. As a result DNA
methylation is decreased. In certain type of cancers hypermethylation of CpG
islands can lead to silencing of genes such as cell cycle control genes which
are important to keep cell cycle in check. Treatment with DNMT inhibitors like
decitabine reduces DNA methylation at the CpG isalnds and can potentially re-activate silenced
genes.</p>
