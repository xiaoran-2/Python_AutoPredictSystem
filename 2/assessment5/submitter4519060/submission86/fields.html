    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are regions of DNA with a high concentration of CpG sequences and are often found in the promoter regions of genes. They are generally unmethylated in normal cells. Methylation of CpG islands is associated with the silencing of genes, and is part of the process of X inactivation in female mammals. It is also involved with paternal or maternal imprinting of genes. In cancer cells, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated. This leads to the silencing of tumour supressor genes which normally help to regulate cell growth and division and programmed cell death. With these genes inactive, the cell can divide uncontrollably, which is one of the features of a cancer cell. They can fail to respond to signals promoting apoptosis, but continue to live in a damaged state, which is another feature of cancer.<br />In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, the CpG sequences normally tend to be methylated. This seems to be an adaptation to inactivate the repetitive elements which would otherwise copy themselves and insert copies elsewhere in the genome, causing disruption. Cancer cells typically show hypomethylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This allows the repetitive elements to carry out their disruptive actions, causing mutations and interfering with normal gene action. Mutations, damaged chromosomes and disruption to the genome generally are features of cancer cells. The usual operations and control pathways of the normal cell are no longer working correctly and the cell grows out of control. Source - lectures.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele has methylation of the imprint control
region of Igf2. This prevents the binding of CTCF. Without CTCF, enhancers
further along the chromosome can loop to access Igf2 and activate it. Also, the
methylation spreads to the H19 region and prevents the expression of H19.</p><p>The maternal allele is not methylated in the imprint control
region. This allows CTCF to bind. The enhancers are unable to loop to activate
Igf2, and so Igf2 is silenced. The H19 gene is also unmethylated, the enhancers
loop to promote its action, and H19 is produced. In this way, Igf2 is
maternally imprinted. Only the paternal allele is expressed. </p><p>Wilm’s tumour is a cancer of the kidney found in children. A
predisposing factor is a loss of the normal imprinting of Igf2. The maternal
imprinting could be lost by mutation or deletion of the control region, giving
two active copies of Igf2. Igf2 is an oncogene. It promotes growth. Having two
active copies will promote excessive growth which could be a contributory cause
of cancer.</p><p>In general, cancer is often associated with a loss of imprinting and over-expression of oncogenes. Source - lectures.</p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine(Dacogen) is a DNA demethylating agent. It acts to
remove methyl groups from CpG sequences of DNA and thus reduce the amount of
DNA methylation. Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which
are precursors of a type of leukaemia. Since hypermethylation of CpG islands in
the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes will act to silence the genes,
a reduction of methylation might turn the genes back on. The active genes play
a part in the proper regulation of cell growth, division and death. With these
genes back in action, the cell might return to normal or, if it is too badly
damaged, proceed to apoptosis. In this way, Decitabine might prevent cells from
becoming cancer cells. Sources - lectures and Economist article.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the genome because it is passed on to the daughter cells during mitosis. As DNA is replicated, the pair of methylated CpG
dinucleotides separate and form templates for unmethylated CpG nucleotides,
giving rise to hemimethylated DNA. The enzyme DNMT1 then methylates the newly
formed CpG so that the new copies of DNA have the same methylation as the
original DNA. The pattern of methylation can therefore be stable for the life
of the organism. Any changes effected by drugs would be inherited by the daughter cells. Epigenetic markers such as DNA methylation need to be removed
and reset at two points in the life cycle, and these points are the sensitive
periods. <span>One sensitive period is during germ cell
development, when only the methylation of repeated sequences is retained and other marks, including imprinting, are reset. The other is during pre-implantation development of the early
embryo. It would be unwise to risk upsetting the changing pattern of
methylation during these periods. Anyone requiring treatment should therefore avoid conception and pregnancy before, during and after the administration of the drug, until the effect has worn off.<br />Source - lectures.</span><p></p></div>
