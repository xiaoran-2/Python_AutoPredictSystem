    <h1>Submission 798 from Anon (session_user_id: 0c00a864852a5d7d2981da89e7743ea9ec824724)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA-Demethylating agents. It decreases the amount of  Methylation in cells. Many cancers especially lymphomas are cused by overactivity of an enzyme called EZH2. When it is overactive , it  methylates histomes that in turn silence genes that they surround especially the tumour supressing ones. By de-methyliizig the histones, the the Dna, the expression of the tumour suppression genes would have a better chance of being expresed. This would slow the growth and proliferstion of tumour cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. The changes are passed during cell division. This means that daughter cells and grandaughter cells would retain the changes in Methylization unless they are erased. The only time in normal development of cell lines that you would see a erasure of the markers is during periods when the genome is going through change . This would be during the germ cells(Ovum, sperm), early development and differentation of cell likes from omni, pluri-potent(Stem cells).  to specific lines of cells such as skin or heart tissue. You also see this at puberty for males as this is when they are develping what will later be their sperm cells. Exposure to different agents at these times could cause epigenetic changes that could have lasting health effects for generations to come.<br /><br /> Treating patient during these times could cause unexpected genetic changes to their genome. It may no just effect the cancer genes, as all the quick growing cells would be affected by the Silencing or Expression of parts of the DNA. For example it would not be good for eye tissue to have a part of the DNA switched on that codes for heart tissue.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"> Normallyt CpG islands are free fom Methylation whether active or not. In cancer these areas are Hypermethelated. This then cuses the underlying gene to be silenced. If the genes are silenced, some markers that preserve gene identity can be lost. All daughter cells that result from cell division would also retain the markers of the parent cell. Without the stability during cell division, cellular identity is lost. Without the regualtor genes the cell looses the markers on the non coding RNA, that is needed for differentation. <br /><br /> An another group of non-coding RNA (transcribed ultraconserved regions), has been shown to be acting abnormally in some cancers such as Colorectal, leukemia and neuroblastomas, when not correctly coded.  Normally DNA is subject to highly regulated, and stable markers that  differentiate tissue and govern its growth and nature. It is important as there is a need for gene silencing, such as tfor example the extra x chromosone.<br /><br /> DNA Methlyation in the Intergenetic elements is is disrupted in cancer. The Methylation is lowered overall, but some areas may become more metlylated. This causes the cell specific markers to be lost, and the cells to become unstable. The Tumour suppressing genes can become silenced, cell division, growth and matrix remodelling can become erratic. The cells without cell specific  markers can become much like a stem cell and invade surrounding tissue as the daughter cells woul retain the erroneous marker of the parent cells. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprinting control region is acquired from the male germ line.  It affects the metlylation status of the lg2 area that has to do with the growth factor. The maternal allele tends to be silent, but loss of methylization on the paternal allele can reactivate the normally Silent maternal . In the case of the Wilm's tumour there is a defect in the Igf2 cluster that causes loss of methylation allowing the growth factor to express. If the growth factor is over- expressed, the cells with this marker would pass on to their daugter cells abnormal growth atterns. They would not go through the normal cycle of dividing and dieing. These cells could become invasive and cause the person to have a higher risk for the Wilm's tumour. </div>
