    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are generally hypomethylated in normal cells.
<br /><br />In cancer cells CpG islands become hypermethylated which causes silencing of the associated gene.  This hypermethylation may occur through the action of PRC complexes such PRC1 which contain a complex of proteins involved in methylation. One protein EZH2, which is part of the PRC complex, is overexpressed in tumors.  The denovo methyl transferases have been shown to mutated in some types of cancers.<br /><br />Many of the genes silenced by hypermethylation of CpG islands are involved in cell-cycle regulation, DNA repair, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis.<br /><br />Intergenic methylation is often found in repetitive sequences. It is thought that intergenic methylation inhibits transcriptional start sites from alternative promoters, inhibits antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing.<br /><br />Loss of DNA methylation from intergenic and repetitive elements may allow altered transcription from these sites previously blocked by methylation resulting in activation of oncogenes, may allow intragenic noncoding RNA transcripts, lead to genomic instability, affect imprinted genes.<br /><br /><br /><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele, there is methylation at the ICR which blocks CTFC binding and allows methylation to also occur at the H19 promoter which blocks the ability of the downstream H19 enhancers from interacting with the H19 promoter.  Thus, the downstream H19 enhancers can interact with the Igf2 promoter and enables the express of Igf2.<br /> <br />On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated allowing CTFC and other enhancer factors to bind in the ICR. This blocks the ICR promoter and allows enhancers downstream of H19 to activate the H19 promoter. The interaction of the H19 enhancers with H19 doesn't allow the H19 enhancers to interact with the Igf2 promoter and thus Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele instead of being unmethylated is methylated like the paternal allele.  THis results in the expression of IgF2 from both the paternal and maternal alleles. IGF2 is involved in stimulation of growth of cells and overexpression may lead to uncontrolled cellular proliferation.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a marketed drug that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome.  Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that inhibits DNMti by irreversibly binding to the enzyme. Its mechanism of action is unclear but may work in myelodysplastic syndrome by preventing hypermethylation of a tumour suppressor gene.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Unlike genetic mutations epigenetic changes are potentially reversible.  So, for example, genes silenced by hypermethylation can potentially be reactivated by demethylation of CpG islands.  <br /><br />Sensitive periods are when DNA methylation patterns are reprogrammed, i.e., DNA methylation patterns are erased. This occurs during formation of the gametes and early embryogenesis.<br /><br />It would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods do to the potential of transgenerational effects that could result. <br /></div>
