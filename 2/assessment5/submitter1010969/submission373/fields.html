    <h1>Submission 373 from Anon (session_user_id: 870bee69583d7462cb3c4652154dd2cf9cd22189)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of <span>DNA-demethylating agents which inhibit DNA methyltransferase. <br /><br />Decitabine is incorporated into DNA where it inhibit DNA methltransferase. This inhibition culminates in hypomethylation of DNA hence working as an antineoplastic agent.<br /><br />It is a cytidine analog which implies that it is incorporated into DNA (in the place of cytidine). We know that some cancers come with the hypermethylation of CpG islands. Incorporation of decitabine implies that methylation of the cytosine residues is no longer possible hence hypermethylation of CpG island can be reversed.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The function of methylation at CpG islands is to determine the level of expression of the gene in whose promoter the methylation is found. Hypermethylation of CpG islands implies the regulation of the gene is low while hypomethylation of CpG islands implies the gene is highly expressed.</p><p>In cancer, the normally hypomethylated CpG islands become hypermethylated. </p><p>Genome wide methylation profiles of cells show a general hypermethylation in normal cells. However, in cancer cells, the hypermethylation is greatly disrupted leaving a genome wide hypomethylation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>In Wilms tumour,  IGF2 is maternally imprinted and so maternal loss of Igf2 allele leads to an increased gene dosage if there is associated paternal duplication. </p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation is synonymous with altering the genes that are actively being expressed and those that are silent. Hypomethylation at CpG islands results in increased expression of genes involved while hypermethylation of CpG islands leads to the silencing of the genes. Hypermethylation of the rest of the genome is the norm. Alteration of the methylation at this region of the epigenome also has lasting consequences. And these changes become a big problem when they are accompanied by debilitating impacts on physiology and health due to their mitotical inheritability.<br /><br />Sensitive periods are those intervals in the life of a human being when the genome is more susceptible to the environment. Hence it as at these times that epigenetic marks are laid down in the genome. <br /><br /><strong>Sensitive periods are:  </strong>Early development and pre germ cell development<br /><br />Treating patients during the sensitive period would alter not only the DNA methylation of the gene concerned. It would alter the entire DNA profile of the genome. This might therefore result in many epimutation which in themselves can initiate disease.</div>
