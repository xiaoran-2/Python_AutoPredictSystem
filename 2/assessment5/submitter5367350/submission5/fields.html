    <h1>Submission 5 from Anon (session_user_id: 7ad96d5ab7ad18b641c7d7fc8e1321cf499360e9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is a particularly attractive form of regulation to target in treatments because it</div><div>can be manipulated once, and enduring effects are ensured as the DNA methyltransferase</div><div>enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis. However, these global interventions may</div><div>interfere with ordinary functioning of the system, especially during critical periods ­­ periods of</div><div>time where extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs. In particular, it would be inadvisable to</div><div>prescribe these treatments to pregnant mothers (including a few months before conception) as</div><div>a lot of reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the formation of gametes.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, and thus contributes to</div><div>hypomethylation of DNA. This turns out to be particularly useful in treating myelodysplatic</div><div>syndrome (conditions under which the bone marrow produces deformed blood cells), which is a</div><div>precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia. In case of Decitabine, the anti­tumour effect has</div><div>been linked to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor supressor genes, induced by the</div><div>hypothemylation.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In a cell around the H19/Igf2 locus we ordinarily see the methylation of the paternal allele at the</div><div>ICR, and no methylation for the maternal allele. The CTCF complex binds to the allele on the</div><div>maternal strand and the downstream enhancers act on H19 as a result. The CTCF complex</div><div>does not bind to the paternal allele due to the methyl marks, which leads to silencing of the H19</div><div>gene as the enhancers instead drive expression of Igf2. Thus, in a regular cell you observe a</div><div>normal dose of both H19 from maternal strand, and Igf2 from paternal strand. However, when</div><div>this ICR becomes hypermethylated, both strands appear to be of paternal origin and get</div><div>expressed as such. That is, the system gets a double dose of (growth­promoting) Igf2 (as well</div><div>as no dose of H19). This is associated with Wilm's tumour.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In general in a normal cell you find that the CpG islands are hypomethylated (under methylated <br />or not very methylated), and the intergeneic</div><div>regions, introns and repetitive elements are hypermethylated (over methylated compared<br />to the average amount of methylation). In a cancer cell this pattern is generally reversed., <br /> CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated, while</div><div>introns and repetitive elements  are hypomethylated.<br />For the CpG islands,  tumor</div><div>suppressor genes may become silenced, allowing the cell to divide more rapidly,<br /> and grow into a tumour. For the intergenic regions and repetitive elements,<br />, normally hypermethylation at</div><div>these sites is associated with greater genomic stability, so hypomethylation during cancer leads</div><div>to copying errors such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the</div><div>chromosomes.</div><div><br /></div></div>
