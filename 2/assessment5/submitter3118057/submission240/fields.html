    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation of DNA cause a gen silencing, and a good way to silence a gen is by blocking the gen promoter, commonly found in CpG islands. So when the CpG island is methylated the promoter is blocked and the gen silence. This is what happend in cancer CpG islands hypermethylation, where you block the promoter and cause a silencing, specially of supressor tumors gens allowing the cancer cell proliferation.<br />In the case of the intergentic regions (IR) and repetititve elements (RE), this places are normally methylated in some extense to perserve the genomic structure and prevent inestability. In cancer cells this methylated IR and RE are hypomethylated therefore altering the genomic architecture causing inestability and allowing deletions, insertions and translocations causing even more damage to the DNA.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 expression, as we know, is different in each paternal allele. In the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated, allowing the CTCF to bing to the ICR, this binding prevents the enhancers to activate Igf2  but allows expression of H19. In the other hand, in the paternal allele where the ICR is methylated, the CTCF can't bind to the ICR hence, allowing the enhancer to activate and express Igf2 and prevent the expression of H19. In case of the Wilm's tumour the maternal allele ICR is methylated, therefore, the maternal allele acts like a paternal allele, meaning, it express Igf2 and prevent H19 expression. This alteration cause for an increase amount of Igf2 protein wich stimulate cell growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor). The Decitabine prevents the methylation of the DNA by making and irreversible bind with the DNMT. The way they do this is:<br />The DNMTi are nucleoside analogues that are added to the DNA during the replication, once added the DNMT tries to methylate the new form strand of DNA to mantain DNA methylation, but this analogues make and irreversible bind with the DNMT preventing of adding the methyl group and also preventing the DNMT to detach. If the DNMT can not detach this cause a genome-wide hypomethylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The DNA methylation is one of the mitotically heritable epigenetics properties of the genome. If you make and alteration in the DNA methylation in a mother cell, all of the cells daughter that comes from that mother cell will have the same DNA methylation alteration. This is even  more important in the sensitive period, wich can be define like the moments in life where the epigenetic marks are removed and added again (epigenetic reprogramming). The 2 main sensitive periods are: "The early development" (during blastocyst) and "Primordial Germ Cell and Germ cell Development".<br />So, if we use epigentic-drugs during this sensitive periods we disrupt the epigenetic reprogramming, this can modify the epigenetic marks in a person, therefore, making him mor susceptible or not for disease.</div>
