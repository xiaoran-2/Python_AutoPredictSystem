    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally methylation at CPG islands functions to silence a gene. So genes that are not needed are silenced through this method, but normal active genes are not methylated at their CPG islands. In cancer, the CPG islands are HYPERmethylated at promotor regions of tumor suppressor genes, therefore silencing them and making one more "hit" towards development of cancer. Because the tumor suppressor gene may have functions in regulating cell cycle, initiating apoptosis or may be involved in chromosome repair, a lack of activity of these genes can lead to uncontrolled cell division, cells that do not undergo apoptosis when they are damaged and cells that DNA that does not get repaired when damaged. In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are HYPERmethylated because these regions do not need to be transcribed. In a cancerous cell, these regions are often HYPOmethylated leading to expression of areas not intended for translation (contributing to "transcriptional noise") and genomic instability. This genomic instability contributes to cancer development due to incorrect splicing or altered gene structure. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (Dacogen) is a DNA Demethylating agent produced by a Japanese company names Eisai to help treat myelodysplastic syndromes. As a demethylating agent, it would function to remove some of the methyl groups from the hypermethylated CPG islands or tumor suppressor genes for example. Removing these methyl groups would allow the gene to become active again. Increasing the activity of a tumor suppressor gene will have an anti-tumor effect.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">I really ran out of time on this written assignment.... I apologize. I hate getting a zero for a question but such is life. But let me just take this opportunity to tell some strangers that its been really nice studying with you all.   :)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome because methylation can be mitotically inherited. This is due to the fact the DNMT1 has an affinity for hemi methylated DNA and methylates the other strand. A sensitive period refers to periods when the genome will be more negatively affected by epigenetic changes. Sensitive periods of development include during embryo development and meiosis to form the gametes. It can be bad to treat patients during the sensitive period because the epigenome is in the process of erasing the epigenetic marks and/or is developing the embryo. This will lead to problems that will not be a concern if the patient is treated outside of the sensitive period. </div>
