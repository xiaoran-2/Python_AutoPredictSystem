    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often found in promotor regions in mammalian cells. In general these CpG's are unmethylated when the gene is expressed probably because the<br />unmethylated state allows the transciptional machinery to bind. Also the CpG's play an important role in maintaining the X-inactvation. In cancer the cpG islands become hypermethylated (so, an overdosis of methylation) and this silences the gene. This might be caused by 1)the fact that the transciptional machinery cannot recongize the methylated DNA anymore, but also because methylated DNA attracts factors that change the chromatin structure. The methylation of CpG promotor regions can cause cancer because the normal tumor suprressor genes (the genes that usually limit cellgrowth) are now silenced. As a result, unlimited cell-division can occur.</p><p>Methylation of other regions in the DNA such as intergenic regions and repetitive elements seems to be necessary to stabilize the genomic architecture. (for example, inhibition of transposition and/or inhibition of the strong LTR promotors). In general, in these regions the DNA becomes hypomethylated during cancer development and this is associated with destabilization of the genome.The exact consequence of this hypomethylation depends on the location and context. Hypomethylation makes the chromatin more "open" and thus prone to errors and changes. Repeats and transposons can be activated. Also, oncogenes (genes that promote cell-growth) can be activated and therefore the cells start to grown without inhibition"<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>"The Imprinting Control Region for the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated(imprinted) on the paternal allele, this methylation also silences the H19 promotor and no H19 lnRNA is produced. As a result there is no binding of A CTCF/H19 complex. The enhancers (that would be attracted by the CTCF/H19 complex are now free to enhance transcription of Igf2.So, in normal situations Igf2 would be produced from the Paternal allele. The maternal ICR in this locus is unmethylated, which means that H19 lnRNA can be produced. This lnRNA forms a complex with CTCF that can bind the DNA and the enhancers. The complex works as an insulator, insulating the Igf2 gene from its enhancers. As a result, Igf2 is not produced from the maternal allele. Changes in the methylation pattern (can have different reasons) can cause methylation of the ICR in this region. This makes that the maternal allele (usually unmethylated) starts to behave like a paternal allele (methylated). In this case there are 2 alleles that produces IGF2, whereas ony 1 is required. This double dose of IFG2 (which is a growth factor) promotes cellgrowth and thus causes cancer.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. This means that it inhibits DNA methylation. As a nucleoside-like small molecule it is incorporated into DNA. But in contrast to normal cytosine bases, this molecule can now bind DNMT during methlation and thereby inhibit DNMT function. This will avoid further hypermethylation of the genome. Especially the methylation of CpG rich promotor regions will now be limited which means that normal tumor-supressor genes will be expressed and cell-growth will be controlled.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNa methylation is closely related to the chromatin architecture. Methylation patterns can attract certain histone modifiers and histone epigenetic signals. This can "close" or "open" the DNA, and also transfer the DNA to certain locations in the cell. Even after the the drug treatment is finished the structural effects will remain. <br />Sensitive periods are those periods in which the DNA is reprogrammed with new epigenetic marks. </p><p>The sensitive periods in human development are during the development of the primordial germ cells, and during zygote formation. Treating patients with drugs that change the epigenetics processes is very risky because correct reprogramming of DNA is required for life. We have seen that for many genes the balance between gene expression and silencing is important because you want the correct dose of genes (for example in tumor supressor genes and oncogenes). Also, methylation is linked to DNa structural architecture and stabilization. Using demethylating agents during the sensitive periods will result in instable DNA. The cells affected during these periods are meant to give rise to many daughter cells and because the epigenetic marks are inheritable, all cells will suffer from this instability. </p><p><br /></p></div>
