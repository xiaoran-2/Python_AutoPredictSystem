    <div class="field-value">CpG island hypermethylation is an example of locus-specific hypermethlation--that is, it does not affect the entire genome, but rather only certain parts of it.  <br />CpG islands occur at the promoter region of genes.  Typically, they are unmethylated, allowing for gene expression.  However, when methylation occurs, the chromatin condenses, blocking transcription, and the gene is silenced.  If the gene is a tumor suppressor, then the silencing prevents the gene from suppressing cell growth.  Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the cell with hypermethylated CpG islands will produce daughter cells, who will in turn produce daughter cells, all of which will be hypermethylated. This, in turn, gives rise to the uncontrolled growth of cells and thus a cancerous tumor.  CpG island methylation can often affect not just one gene, but groups of genes <br /><br /><br />While CpG islands are normally unmethylated, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated.  This methylation has a stabilizing effect on the genome as it makes repetitive elements inactive.  When these intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated, then repetitive elements can copy themselves (so that the cell has even more repeats than before), and even insert themselves into other areas of the genome.  They can cause insertions, deletions, and translocations; illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes may occur as well.  Because so much of the genome consists of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, their hypomethylation is associated with global hypomethylation of the entire genome--and this is one of the hallmarks of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can have serious effects on the genome.  Disruptions may take the form of either hypermethylation or hypomethylation.  Hypermethylation can turn off genes that restrict growth, while hypomethylation can turn on genes that promote growth, both of which lead to cancer.  A case in point is the methylation pattern in lgf2, where disruption of normal methylation patterns results in Wilm's tumor.<br /><br />In a normal cell, the imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster in the paternal allele is methylated, while the ICR in the maternal allele is unmethylated.  Therefore, the ICR of H19/Igf2 is paternally imprinted (only the maternal allele is expressed).  The ICR of the maternal allele, since it is unmethylated, binds to CTFC, an insulator protein that blocks downstream enhancers from accessing Igf2, which is upstream of the ICR.  The enhancers therefore activate H19, a lncRNA, instead.  On the paternal allele, because the ICR is silenced, CTFC cannot bind; the enhancers are not blocked and are thus able to access Igf2, which is then expressed.<br /><br />If the ICR in the maternal allele is methylated, the enhancers are not blocked, so they access Igf2.  The overexpression of Igf2 results in Wilm's tumor, a cancer of the kidney.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylization agent (DNMT inhibitor), used for myelodysplastic syndrome which has progressed to AML, acute myeloid leukemia.  It is incorporated into the DNA, binding to DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) when the DNA replicates.  Because it hypomethylates the DNA, it allows the expression of tumor suppressor genes.  Its effects are permanent; once bound to DNMT1, it cannot be removed.  Also, it is mitotically heritable, which means that the daughter cells will have the DNMT1 inhibitor as well.  In cancer, since tumor cells divide and replicate more quickly than normal cells, decitabane acts relative quickly to slow or stop further division and thereby stopping further tumor growth.  <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dr. Stephen Baylin used a combination of DNMT1 inhibitors (azacitidine rather than decitabane) and histone deacetylase inhibitors to treat people with advanced lung cancer (and solid tumors).  This treatment slowed tumor growth, notable because this was the first time that such drugs had been successful against a solid tumor; patients who did not respond immediately to treatment did, however, respond better to standard chemotherapy than is usually the case.<br /><br />What is not known is exactly what long-range effects alteration of DNA methylation will have on the epigenome.  If a patient has taken a DNA methyltransferase drug, then potentially all cells could eventually be affected--not just the tumor cells--and this has the potential to produce negative effects.  <br /><br />Certainly, given the questions about the long-range effects of such drugs, one would want to avoid treating a pregnant woman with them to avoid the two especially sensitive periods for erasure and re-establishment of epigenetic marks:  early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development.  Drugs altering DNA methylation could affect the marks laid down during early embryonic development, which would then be maintained for life.  Effects on the epigenetic marks in primordial germ cells could adversely affect the next generation.  <br /></div>
