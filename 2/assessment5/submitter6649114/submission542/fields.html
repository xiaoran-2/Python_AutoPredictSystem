    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can be altered in cancer in two ways, either via locus specific hypermethylation or genome wide hypomethylation of regions of the gene which do not occur in non-cancerous cells. In normal cells the CPG islands are hypomethylated, whereas in cancer cells, the CPG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated. These CPG islands are usually found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, therefore when they are hypermethylated this leads to the silencing of these tumor suppressor genes. Since this is mitotically heritable, it leads to further hypermethylation in future generations of the cell, which are usually rapidly selected. Furthermore, in normal non-cancerous cells, the intergenic regios and the repetitive elements are hypermethylated, whereas in cancerous cells they are hypomethylated. The disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can lead to changes in the methylation of ICRs and therefore disruptions in imprinting. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">One of the most common characteristics of cancer cells is the loss of imprinting. Genes that should be showing monoallelic, parent-of origin-specific expression (i.e. imprinting) do not show this imprinting, but instead are either expressed from both alleles or silenced in both alleles.  Many of these are involved in growth which explains their link to cancer. We can have either hypermethylation or hypomethylation of imprint control regions in cancer. In the case of the H19/lgf2 cluster, it is an imprint control region which is is methylated at the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. When it is unmethylated, CTCF  binds to its insulator element leading to the enhancers acting on the H19, with the Igf2 silenced in this case. In the paternal allele, due to the methylation of this imprint control region the promoters act on the lgf2 insted of the H19. and the Ogf2 is expressed. Though the loss of imprinting we get hypermethylation in the imprint control region of the maternal allele too, and expression of Igf2 (leading to a double dose of Igf2 compared to normal cells) . Since Igf2 is related to growth, this the double dose leads to Wilms tumor. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. This means that it reverses DNA methylations, by unmethylating previously methylated regions of the DNA. One of the ways in which Decitabine could have an anti-tumour effect is by unmethylating regions of the DNA which control tumour suppression. When methylated, these tumor suppression genes are not expressed, leading to the uncontrollable growth of cancerous cells. By unmethylating these regions the tumor suppression genes can be active again, controlling the growth of tumors. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a process that is mitotically heritable. This means that when the DNA is replicated, the methylation remains in the same region in the cells that follow, therefore methylation of a specific region can have lasting effects on the epigenome, since it can be mitotically inherited to the daughter cells. A sensitive period, is a period of development during which there is heightened sensitivity to external stimuli and can be critical to development. Some example of sensitive periods of development are the blastocyst stage and the mid-gestation period of embryonic development. During these periods, a lot of epigenetic reprogramming takes place, altering the methylation of different parts of the genes. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable since it could lead to the altering of methylation in regions of the DNA where it shouldn't be altered, and since methylation is mitotically heritable it can lead to long term abnormalities both for the individual as well as its offsprings. </div>
