    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a chemotherapeutic drug used in the treatment of cancer, specifically approved for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)..  Decitabine is classified            as an antimetabolite and a DNA demethylation agent.</p><p>Decitabine works by demethylation of DNA in cancer cells that silences tumour suppressor genes.  Through demethylation, normal function to the tumour suppressor genes            is restored.</p><p>As an antimetabolite, Decitabine is incorporated into the cell's metabolism, where it interacts            with targets within the cell to kill rapidly dividing cancer cells. </p><p>Further information:  <a title="Link: http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx" href="http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx">http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx</a></p><p><b></b></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that target epigenetic regulators might be effective past the treatment period by the process Dr. Baylin mentions in the Economist article.  If the cancer is enabled thru epigenetic changes which are mitotically heritable, reversing such changes can lead to re-enabling the cell functions that suppress tumour growth that are mitotically heritable and passed on in the succeeding generations of cells.  This may lead to the cancer being stopped and/or made vulnerable to other treatment modalities that cause cancer cell death.</p><p>A sensitive period is when epigenetic programming is cleared and reset.</p><p>Sensitive periods occur during development of germ cells and early embryonic development, as well as during other critical developmental plasticity stages as explained below..  </p><p>There have been studies, in animals and humans showing a link between certain early life environmental factors and increases risk of metabolic disorders in later life. This lead to the Developmental Programming hypotheses - environmental influences during critical development placsticity periods can initiate life-long effects on health and well being.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated which blocks CTCF binding, the enhancers act on lgf2 and lgf2 is expressed</p><p></p><p>On the maternal allele CTCF, an insulator, block downstream enhancers from acting on lgf2. The result is that the ICR is not methylated, the enhancers then act on H19 and Igf2 is silenced and is not expressed </p><p>In Wilm;s tumour (Nephroblastoma), hyper-expression is also present on the maternal allele.  The lgf2 is expressed on both maternal and paternal alleles promotes abnormal growth associated with this childhood kidney cancer  It is highly treatable, with a ~90% cure rate (survival &gt;4 years -  <a title="Link: http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/989398-overview#showall" href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/989398-overview#showall">http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/989398-overview#showall</a>).</p><p>As we learned in Week 4 and further developed in Week 7, many imprinted genes are involved in growth regulation.  Loss/disruption of imprinting is a common feature of cancer.  H19/lgf2 cluster imprinting disruption silences H19, while downstream enhancers act to express lgf2.  In Beckwith-Wiedeman syndrome, for example, there is upregulation of lgf2, an oncogene, growth promoter, in linked Kcnq1-lgf2/H19 clusters at 11q15.5 and the loss of Cdkn1c tumour suppressor, growth suppressor.  </p><p><br /></p></div>
