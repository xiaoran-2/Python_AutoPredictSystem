    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is synonymous with silencing of gene expression. In other words it is an inactive epigenetic mark. Generally, in normal cells, we see hypomethylation at CpG islands. In cancer cells teh reverse happens, there is hypermethylation (more than usual) methylation at CpG islands. usually since these Cpg islanbds are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. If a cancer cell is able to inactivate tumor suppressor genes by hypermethylation (remember methylation is an inactivation mark) then the cancer. Then that cell can multiply rapidly without any suppression by the action of the tumor suppressing genes.<br /><br />On the other hand, in a normal cell the intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypermethylated. it is believed that this methylation at intergenic regions and repeat elements serve to maintain genomic stability. this is usually seen in cells that don't contain DMNT1 - a maintenance methyltransferase which exhibit genomic instability. what is the effect of this genomic instability? Well, many things could happen, for instance deletions, insertions, duplications, swapping etc. As a result of which the identity of that section of the genome continually mutates. <br /><br />in the re[repetitive elements, in general what they do is they copy themselves, they may jump out of place and place themselves somewhere else either in a copy-and-paste mechanism or a cut-and-paste mechanism this effect too is obviously mutagenic. Since these may cause disruptions at the places where they paste themselves. so generally, silencing these intergenic regions and repetitive elements will prevent these mutagenic effects. <br /><br />However, in cancer cells, the methylation at these regions become hypomethylated, thus increasing the chances for illegitimate deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations and even duplication of chromosomes or loss of chromosomes. Which results in genomic instability.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the lgf2 cluster of imprinted genes, this imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele and is bound by a protein called CTCF. CTCF is an insulator protein which means it is able to insulate lgf2. In the paternal allele where this imprint control region is methylated CTCF can no longer bind and the enhancers are free to act to promote lgf2 expression from the paternal allele. On the other hand, on the maternal allele because the imprint control region is unmethylated CTCF can bind to and insulate lgf2 leaving the enhancers free to act on H19 so that lgf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele.<br /><br />in Wilm's tumour, a disruption may result in effectively what looks like two paternal alleles which means you get too much lgf2. Since lgf2 is a growth promoter, an oncogene; it results in Wilm's tumour. <br /><br />This disruption in imprinting resulting in either silencing of H19 a tumour suppressor or overexpression of lgf2 a growth promoter can result in cancer. Infact this loss of imprinting is actually a hallmark of cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNA-demethylating agent), in the form of azacitidine, They are nucleoside analogs which get incorporated into DNA upon replication and then when DNA methyltransferase - DNMT1 - comes to bind that nucleotide and copy the methylation to the daughter strand, the DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is cell division dependent so you have to have cell replicating.<br /><br />This is where its beauty lies, since cancer which are dividing more rapidly than most of the other cells in the body will be most severely affected since they are replicating more. In this way decitabine has an anti-tumour (anti-neoplastic effect) by essentially killing the tumour/repidly replicating cancer cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can be a stable epigenetic mark. Because at every cell division this DNA methylation will be copied by DNMT1 onto the new daughter strands of DNA. A sensitive period is when there are the largest periods of epigenetic programming. Essentially during these sensitive periods all the methylation marks are cleared and re-established,<br /><br />These sensitive periods are two (a). during early development (early embryonic development reprogramming) as early as six hours post fertilization until when the blastocyst is implanted and (b). during primordial germ cell development.<br /><br />Treating patients with such epigenetics drugs like decitabine will be inadvisable during these periods since all the cells concerned (blastocysts and primordial germ cells) are passing through a sensitive process of reprogramming where they lose and re-establish their epigenetic marks. Much unlike normal somatic cells who stably maintain and pass on their epigenetic marks during normal cell division. In these sensitive periods the epigenetic drugs wouldn't be able to selectively bind/inhbit cancer cells but will also affect the embryonic and primordial germ cells since they are undergoing reprogramming, Thus the drug will interfere with the normal reprogramming mechanism occurring at these sensitive periods and result in [ossibly severe to extreme consequences,<br /><br /><br /></div>
