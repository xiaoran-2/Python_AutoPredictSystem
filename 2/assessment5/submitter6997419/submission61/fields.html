    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><pre><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">The CpG islands are usually protected from methylation in normal cells because when the methylation occurs it causes silencing of gene expression. These cells generally show intergenic regions and repetitive elements  methylated. The DNA methylation function in intergenic regions would be silence the cryptic transcription    start sites or cryptic splice sites, while repetitive elements are responsible for maintaining genomic integrity. </span><br /><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">On the other hand, cancer cells display a DNA hypermethylation in CpG islands, and hypomethylation of CpG    poor promoters and repeats/ intergenic regions, which helps the silencing of tumour suppressor genes, therebycontributing to the development of cancer. The hypomethylation of repeats/intergenic regions create a genomic instability by allowing illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and cryptic promoters, etc. </span><br /><br />Reference source: Marnie's classes<br /></pre></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normal cells have one methylated allele (normally the paternal) and they have the ICR’s and repetitive elements methylated, causing the inactivation of H19 cluster and allowing the enhancers to act on the expression of Igf2. The maternal allele, however, is unmethylated, wich allows the ICR-CTCF bind, and consequently silencing the Igf2 expression, because the enhancers, in this case, acting on the H19 cluster.<br />Alterations in DNA methylation on ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. Individuals with Wilm’s tumour have hypermethylation of ICRs, which means the imprinting is disrupted and both alleles are methylated causing the overexpression of Igf2. Igf2 is a growth factor active in early development, responsible for regulate cell growth and differentiation, and is monoallelically expressed in most tissues. Therefore, its overexpression could develope in diseases, such as cancer, due to abnormal growth of cells.<br /><br />Reference source: Marnie's classes</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine are used to treat
myelodysplastic syndromes, and belongs to a group of drugs called "demethylating"
agents. They hypomethylate DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. When
the DNA methylation increases, the result is a silencing of "suppressor
genes" that regulate cell division and growth, therefore the cell division becomes
unregulated and promotes cancer. The Decitabine works restoring the normal
function to the tumor
suppressor genes by demethylation, promoting its expression and an anti-tumour
effect. These kind of drugs are used in response to many other
tumours, including solid tumours.  </p>Reference source: <a href="http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx#.U5GyBXJUHzY" title="Link: http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx#.U5GyBXJUHzY">http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx#.U5GyBXJUHzY</a><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have enduring effects, because the epigenetic marks are inheritable and maintained during the mitosis by the DNA methyltransferase that preserve methyl marks. The sensitive periods are moments in the development, which the embryo is more susceptible for the changes in the environment, some examples of sensitive periods are: epigenetic reprogramming in early development and in primordial germ cell development. In these periods is not advisable to treat patients with this kind of drugs as it is when epigenetic reprogramming occurs, which can interfere with the normal function of the organism, causing altered epigenomes and alterations in the gene expression and in the phenotype.<br /></p><p>Reference source: Marnie's classes and <a href="http://lumramabaja.wordpress.com/">http://lumramabaja.wordpress.com/</a> <br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>
