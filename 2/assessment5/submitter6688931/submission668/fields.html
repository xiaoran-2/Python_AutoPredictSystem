    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a cancer cell there is DNA hypermethylation of
CpG islands which are found on the promoters of tumor suppressor genes while
repetitive elements, intergenic regions and the introns of genes remain
hypomethylated throughout the genome. Hypomethylation lead to loosely packaged
chromatin of repetitive elements and intergenic regions and that contributes to
illegitimate recombination. Transposition of repeats disrupts an expression of
neighboring genes if they happen to jump and become a cryptic promoter. In
addition you get insertion and deletions due to genomic instability as a consequence of hypomethylation of repetitive elements and inergenic regions. Hypermethylation
of CpG islands is associated with a tumor suppressor genes. And
when the silencing of tumor suppressor genes occurs – the cell’s growth becomes
unstoppable. </p><p>In contrast, in a normal cell repetitive
elements, intergeninc regions and the introns of genes are methylated and CpG
islands are not. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption starts when the imprinted control regions which are involved in growth promoting or growth suppressing either expressed from both parental alleles or silenced from both parental alleles. The imprinted control region is methylated on paternal allele and it is unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it is unmethylated on maternal allele CTCF insulator binds to it and the transcription enhancers activate H19, but lgf2 will be silent. On the paternal allele enhancers act on lgf2, because the imprinted control region in methylated, and lgf2 is expressed from the paternal  allele. With loss of imprinting occurs due to hypermethylation of ICR and lgf2 expressed on the maternal allele. Meaning you are promoting growth a lot without suppressing it at all and this is associated with Wilm's tumor. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to enzymatic epigenetic inhibitor of DNMT. They incorporated into DNA via the replication and when the DNMT comes to bind it that DNMT cannot be copied to a daughter cell, because the drug inhibits it. The drug is causing DNA demethylation to occur and solve the problem of DNA hypermethalation which is the case in cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">By targeting DNA methylation with inhibitors - you target all cells even if they have nothing to do with a tumorigenesis. They have a negative impact if a patient is going thru the sensitive periods when the epigenetic reprogramming is taking place. And clearing of epigenetic marks happens in primordial germ cell stage of development and pre-implantation early development. And when drugs are going to affect every cell throughout the system that will affect clearing and establishing epigenetic marks which are essential for life. </div>
