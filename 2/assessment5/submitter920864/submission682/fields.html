    <div class="field-value">The two main DNA methylation abnormalities found in cancer are genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, large specific DNA hypermethilation, especially in CpG island (CGI) regions, and global disruption of imprinting.<br /><br />On the one hand, CPIs contain promoters of genes at high density and usually stay unmethylated regardless of the gene expression state. DNA methylation at CGIs is associated with silencing of underlying genes. Frequently in cancer CGIs are hypermethylated which causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Regions surrounding CGIs at +-2kb (CGI shores) are also usually hypermethylated in cancer, and correlation between gene expression and CGI shore methylation was found. Although CGI methylation differs at different tumor types, it always progresses with time. The CGI methylation pattern can be used as a biomarker to define tumour type and stage. <br /><br />On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated to promote genomic stability, as long as recombinations between genetically similar repeats, transposons' jumping across the genome and activation of cryptic promoters cause deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations across the genome (unfavourable mutations). Moreover, most of the CpG poor promoters in intergenic regions (CpGs located not in CPIs) are usually also methylated silencing underlying genes. The hypomethylation of repeats happens frequently at the early stages of cancer and also progresses with time producing even more genomic instability and higher probability of mutations. CpG poor promoters' hypomethylation which causes activation of a gene (e.g. some oncogenic, growth gene) is less common but also associated with cancer epigenetic disruptions.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">One of the features of cancer is disruption of methylation in imprinted regions as long as they contain many growth and tumor suppressor genes. One of the examples is H19/Igf2 locus.<br /><br />At the maternal allele ICR is unmethylated and binded by CTCF protein. Due to the chromatin looping Igf2 gene is more preferable for enhancers than H19. But CTCF blocks enhancers' access to Igf2, and Igf2 stays insulated. Thus, enhancers activate H19 and Igf2 is not expressed. <br />At the paternal allele ICR is methylated which prevents CTCF protein from binding. Now there is no blocking on the way of the enhancers. They activate Igf2 and H19 is not expressed.<br /><br />Wilm's tumor is a kidney cancer typically found in children. In Wilm's tumor imprinting at this locus is hypermethylated and both alleles act paternally-like: Igf2 is overexpressed and H19 is underexpressed. This epigenetic disruption predisposes to cancer because Igf2 is considered to be an oncogene that promotes growth in cells, while H19 is a tumour suppressor gene. Thus, in Wilm's tumor the growth genes are activated twofold strong while corresponding tumour suppressor genes are silenced. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is one of the several epigenetic drugs used in cancer treatment (myelodysplastic syndrome evolved to <span>acute myelogenous leukaemia</span>). <br /><br />It belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors. Decitabine is nucleoside analogous, and it binds irreversibly DNA methyltransferases, preventing them from methylating DNA which causes DNA hypomethylation. The drug is replication-dependent, because it binds DNMTs after their incorporation in DNA during replication, affecting the cancer cells the most as long as they divide very rapidly. At high dosages this drug may be toxic because it affects epigenetic machinery in all cells of the body, but at much lower dosage it causes DNA demethylisation. <br /><br />Decitabine as a DNMTi has overall anti-neoplastic effect killing the tumor. It causes the changes in tumor's DNA methylation pattern, activating (not directed effect though) tumor suppressor genes and genes regulating normal cell cycle (that may cause cancer cells' death and replacement with normal cells).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic drugs disrupt epigenetic processes in the genome, especially DNA methylation. DNA methylation is considered to be a sustainable epigenetic change because it is mitotically heritable with the help of DNMTs, that is why changes would not be lost during DNA replication or cell division and there are lasting effects on the patient's health.It is useful in treatment to ensure that tumor would not come back and life expectancy increases. <br /><br />On the other hand, epigenetic drugs influence not only on tumor cells but also on normal cells of the body. Although side effects of epigenetic drugs are considered moderate, they are not studied well. It may be dangerous to use epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods of development when epigenetic marks are actively cleared and re-established. These periods are early development of embryo (preimplantation period) and primodial germ cell development. Such patients include pregnant women (development of embryo) and children up to 12 years (formation of PGCs). These patients are sensitive to disruptions of work of epigenetic machinery, which is at the moment reprogramming epigenome, and drugs may cause mistakes and abberant epigenetic marks, influencing the health of the child and their children in the long-run (predisposition to other diseases), accordingly.</div>
