    <div class="field-value"><span>The
normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands at the promoter is to control
gene expression.  In non-cancerous cells,
genes that should be expressed have CpG islands at the promoter are normally
hypomethylated, in order to allow more accessible and open chromatin structures
to allow for transcription initiation. 
In cancerous cells, CpG islands at promoters of genes that should be
expressed actually tend to be hypermethylated, resulting in a more condensed
chromatin and preventing transcription initiation.  Therefore, these genes in cancer cells are
silenced, whereas in normal cells these genes would be actively
transcribed.  DNA methylation in
intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypermethylated in
non-cancerous cells, which helps to prevent transposition, recombination, and
transcription in these regions.  DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells tend
to be hypomethylated, resulting in a more open chromatin structure. This then allows transposition and/or
recombination in these regions and genomic rearrangements to occur (which are
hallmarks of cancers), and transcription of genes that should not normally be
transcribed.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>The
paternal allele at the H19/Igf2 cluster is usually hypermethylated at the
imprinting control region (ICR) and at the promoter of H19.  This prevents CTCF from binding to the ICR to
block the enhancer from acting on Igf2, and prevents initiation of
transcription at H19.  Therefore, the
paternal allele at the H19/Igf2 usually expresses the Igf2 gene. The maternal
allele at the H19/Igf2 cluster is usually hypomethylated at the ICR.  This allows CTCF to bind to the ICR and block
the enhancers acting on Igf2.  This
results in the enhancers stimulating transcription of H19 on the maternal
chromosome.  In Wilm’s tumor, the
maternal epigenotype alters to the paternal epigenotype, where the ICR is
hypermethylated.  This results in overall
less gene expression of H19, and overall more gene expression of Igf2, since
both the paternal and maternal alleles are being expressed in Wilm’s tumor,
whereas in normal cells only the paternal allele would be expressed.  Igf2 is a growth factor that stimulates cell
growth, and therefore cells will be growing and dividing at a high rate due to having
extra Igf2 protein being produced.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine
belongs to histone methyltransferase inhibitors (HMTi).  EZH2 is part of the PRC2 and normally has the
function of adding three methyl groups to lysine 27 of histone H3, which is a
repressive epigenetic mark that will help condense the chromatin structure and
silence gene expression in the region. 
In some cancers (such as lymphomas), EZH2 is overactive and will potentially
hypermethylate CpG islands in promoters of tumor-suppressor genes, thereby
silencing gene expression and allowing uncontrolled cell division (and tumor
formation).  Decitabine prevents
tri-methylation of H3K27, allowing a more open chromatin structure and allowing
active gene expression of the tumor-suppressor genes.  This will help suppress the cell cycle and
help prevent uncontrolled cell division, thereby having an anti-tumor effect.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Altering
DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because it is
mitotically heritable.  Therefore, if the
epigenome is altered (like by an epigenetic drug), it will be passed on to its
daughter alleles, and so on, every time it divides.  A sensitive period is a period in development
where the epigenome is normally being altered, such as during early embryo development
and development of primordial germ cells. 
During these sensitive periods, DNA methylation and other epigenetic
marks are being removed and added in a context dependent manner.  Treating patients during these periods are inadvisable
because the epigenomes would be altered in such a way as to be passed to not
only the daughter cells, but over generations. 
For example, a female taking epigenetic drugs while newly pregnant could
have the epigenome of the developing fetus altered, and that fetus’ primordial
germ cells could be altered – impacting three generations. <br /></span></p>
