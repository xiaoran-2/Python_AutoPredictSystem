    <div class="field-value"><p>CpGs
are often grouped in clusters called CpG islands, often at the promoters of
genes where transcription occurs. Controlled methylation of such CpG islands
leads to silencing of the gene. Cellular differentiation is determined by the
selective methylation of only a small subset of CpG islands between cell types.
</p>

<p>DNA
methylation at CpG islands is critical to the regulation of gene transcription.
Abnormal DNA methylation patterns – hypermethylation and hypomethylation
compared to normal tissue – have been associated with a large number of human cancers.
Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and
progression of cancer through different mechanisms.</p>



<p>Hypomethylation,
in general, arises earlier and is linked to chromosomal instability and loss of
imprinting, whereas hypermethylation is associated with promoters and can arise
secondary to gene (oncogene suppressor) silencing both of which are
subsequently inherited by daughter cells following cell division.</p>



<p>An
Intergenic region (IGR) is a region of DNA located between genes. These regions
contain functionally important elements such as promoters, enhancers and
non-coding RNAs. In humans, intergenic regions comprise 80% to 90% of the
genome.</p>



<p>Repetitive
elements are sequence patterns that occur in multiple copies throughout the
genome. Certain repeated sequences help structure the chromosome but others are
potentially disruptive.</p>



<p>So
intergenic regions and repeated sequences are usually methylated to regulate
such effects and maintain genomic stability.</p>



<p>DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is found to be consistently
hypomethylated in cancer</p>



<p>Disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions contributes to cancer by disturbing
the regulation of promoters, enhancers and non-coding RNAs which disrupt normal
cellular regulation.</p>



<span>Disruption of DNA
methylation in repetitive elements can results in transposons jumping around
(replicate themselves) at random within the genome and repeated sequences in
general can disrupt normal recombination leading to increased genomic
instability in both cases.</span><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
H19/Igf2 cluster consists of the Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 (Igf2) gene, an
insulator/imprinting control region (ICR) consisting of H19 and several other
genes followed by an upstream enhancer.</p>



<p>In
a normal cell the ICR of the paternal chromosome is hypermethylated via imprinting
and the repressor protein CTCF cannot bind to it resulting in the expression of
Igf2</p>



<p>In
a normal cell the ICR of the maternal chromosome is hypomethylated and a
repressor protein CTCF can bind to it preventing the downstream enhancer from
activating the expression of Igf2</p>



<p>In
Wilm’s tumour the ICR on both the paternal and maternal are hypermethylated the
repressor protein cannot bind resulting in twice the level of expression of
Igf2.</p>Excess
production of Igf2 appears to encourage the development of tumours in the
kidneys of young children and occasionally adults.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent.</p>

<p>Decitabine causes
the passive hypomethylation of DNA by inhibiting DNA MethylTransferase 1
(DNMT1) which is responsible for the maintenance of DNA methylation after every
cellular replication cycle by copying the existing DNA methylation patterns to
the daughter strands. So it will only work in actively dividing cells.</p>

<p>There are several
possibly mechanisms for Decitabine to have an anti-tumour effect. </p>

<p>Firstly, many
tumor suppressor genes are silenced by DNA methylation during carcinogenesis so
it might prove beneficial to re-express these genes by inhibiting methylation.</p>

<p>Secondly, genome wide hypomethylation occurs to some degree in all
tumour types with repetitive sequences most effected.</p>

<p>By their very nature repetitive sequences can act as DNA recombination
sites and are normally hypermethylated to insure that they don’t interfere. Decitabine
induced hypomethylation increases the frequency of deletions, reciprocal
translocations and insertions substantially, leading to genomic instability, impaired
cellular function and cell death.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Every
cell in an organism contains the same genome barring mutations. The epigenome consists
of modifications to the genome that determine cell differentiation which are
passed on during mitotic cell division to subsequent generations of cells in a
given cell line until actively erased.</p>

<p>DNA
methylation consists of adding methyl groups to certain cytosine bases on the
DNA and DNA associated proteins.</p>



<p>Epigenetically,
a sensitive period, is any point in the cell cycle when epigenetic markings are
being laid down, modified or read.</p>



<p>Such
periods would be during mitotic or meiotic cell division. So typically during embryonic
and early childhood development, germ cell, skin, gut or blood cell production
in adults.</p>



<p>Treating
a patient with epigenetic drugs during a sensitive period risks disrupting the
epigenome resulting in long term developmental effects and possibly cancer. </p>



<p>It
would be wise to caution a patient against conceiving, until any germ cells
produced or matured during the period of treatment have been flushed from the
patient’s system. Likewise it would be unwise to treat pregnant mothers or
young children because of the disruption it could cause their tissue
development and the development of germ cells which could affect subsequent
generations.</p>
