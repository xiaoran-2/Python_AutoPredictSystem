    <div class="field-value"><span>Methylation at CpG islands (CGI) (often found at promoters of genes) allows to silence gene expression either by a formation of a repressive chromatic structure or prohibiting transcription factor binding. In cancer, locus specific DNA hypermethylation in such region as CGI, CGI shores and imprinted cluster regions (ICR) occur frequently in tumors, as DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and epimutations are rapidly selected. DNA hypermethylation results in silencing of tumor suppressor genes and loss of imprinting in ICR. The effects of DNA hypermethylation differs by the tumor types and the stage of cancer.<br /><br />The stability of genome is mantained by DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetetive elements located throughout the genome. Silencing of possible repetitive genes or gene promoter by DNA methylation mechanism allows for normal gene expression. In cancer, genome-wide hypomethylation occures </span>to some degree in all tumour types. Consequence of hypomethylation depends on location: genomic instability in repeats/ Intergenic regions; and oncogene activation on the regions of CpG poor promoters. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the ICR of lgf2, the normal cell have igf2 gene silenced on the paternal allele, whereas  igf2 gene is activated at the maternal allele. The imprinting mechanism is realized via enhancers, that enhance H19 gene on the maternal allele and, in turn, do not activate the igf2 gene (no enough resources). On contrast, DNA methylation on the paternal allele does not allow for H19 activation, and igf2 gene is expressed.<br /><br />In cancer, DNA hypermethylation leads to methylation on both paternal and maternal allele. That results in overexpression of igf2 gene, that is an oncogene. Most of imprinted gene are involved in cell growth/death regulation, and, thus, DNA hypermethylation at ICR leads to activation/amplification of oncogenes and silencing the tumor suppressior genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation are epignetically heritable, that allows to have such long-term effects: effects of drugs observed on the chemoteraphy, while the drugs were used some time before. <br /><br />Sensitive period to epigenome occurs when epigenetics reprogrmming happers: early embryon development and germ cells development.  Hence, younger patients (cancer or otherwise), effects on germ cells need to be considered with caution.<br /> </div>
