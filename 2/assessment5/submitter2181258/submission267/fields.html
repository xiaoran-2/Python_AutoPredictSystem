    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In normal  tissues CpG islands, </span>CpG-rich regions of DNA with lengths of 0.5 Kb to several
Kbs,<span> are generally unmethylated independently of their activity state. This regions,
present in about 60% of gene promoters, coulde be related with tissue-specif
genes or  genes involved in pathways that
keep the cell in order (like DNA repair, apoptosis, cell adherence, detoxification).</span></p>

<p><span>In cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to have hypermethylated profiles
in the promoter regions  of the supressor
tumor genes. The explanation  of  this kind of aberrant DNA methylation  is under construction ,  as it is the selection of some genes over
others. Neverthless,  it is belived  that hypermethylation works with other layers
of epigenetic control like </span>methyl-binding
proteins, DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylase.<span>   </span></p>

<p><span>Cancer cells with hypermethylated gene promoter CpG islands  pattern tend to have the underlying genes
silenced , which in case of having a 
tumor supressor role become one more hit towards cancer.  However, 
as cancer embraces a   broad universe of  tumuor types and  cell lineages  this silencing gene expression results in a
spectrum of  different contributions to
the disease.</span></p>

<p><span>The  normal function of  DNA methylation in intergenic regions and
repetitive elements is protecting the genome from transposable elements (DNA
sequences that can change his position within the genome) and though mantain
its integrity.</span></p>

<p>In cancer intergenic regions and repetitive DNA elements tend to be
hypomethylated. This genome-wide hypomethylation tends to be one of the
hallmarks of cancer.</p>

<p><span>The hypomethylation can  lead to
different kinds of  genomic instability like:
illegitimate recombination between 
repeats; activation of repeats and transposition; and activation of
cryptic promoters and dysruption to neighbouring genes.    </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In normal cells the
IGF2 cluster is an imprinted control region displaying parent-of
origin specif expression.  Here  the expressed allele is the
paternal, in which the methylated pattern makes CTCF  not to bimd the insulator, allowing the enhancers to mediate the expression of 
IGF2. </span></p><p> Also in normal cells,
the maternal allele, the one that is silenced for IGF2,  has an unmethylated pattern, what means
that  CTFC can bind the insulator, allowing
in this case the enhancers to act on H19, but not in IGF2 .</p><p> In Wilm´s tumour cells
the specific parent-of-origin monoallelic expression of IGF2/H19 cluster is not
observed.  What happens is that due to a
change in the methylation pattern of the maternal allele, which becomes
methylated  (as the paternal one) , the
maternal allele also origins the expression of IGF2 duplicating its quantity.</p><p>









</p><p><span>Aberrant DNA methylation
find in IG2/H19 cluster could happen either in cases where an hypermethylated
DNA pattern are present in both parent alleles resulting in an overexpression
of  IGF2, either in situations where the
cluster shows hypomethilated DNA patterns in both alleles resulting in an
deficient expression   of  IGF2.
Ovarian cancers  with different
combinations of aberrant methylation indicate that these changes could be
meaningful in tumorogenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to
the class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA-demithylation agents or hypo
methylating  agents</span>, acronim <span>DNMTi , which  means DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.</span></p>

<p>Decitabine induces DNA
demethylation  in a non-random and
reproducible way. In patients with acute myeloid leukemia,  genome wide methylation profile after
treatment with the pharmac present 
hypomethylation, occurring  mainly
in CpG islands and CpG islands associated regions ,  what suggests a differencial activity of
decitabine in different chromossomic regions.</p>

<p>Decitabine is a nucleotide
analog that gets into DNA when replication occurs and binds irreversibly to
DNMT1 preventing the methylation copy to daughter strands. Although its action depends
on cell division as tumour cells divide rapidly become privileged targets.  In some types of cancers the hypomethylation take
place in CpG islands what allows to recover the expression of gene  tumour supressor like the ones involved in
apoptosis. Other unknown actions may also play a role in the disease fighting.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation  is subject to a  process of somatic inheritance that promotes
is pattern continuity upon somatic cell division. A key elements of this
methylation  maintenace are the enzimes
that catalyze the methylation of the hemy-methylated DNA strand generated
during replication. So changes that happen in DNA methylation can be passed to
cell daughter division occurs. </p>

<p>Sensitive periods are
those when epigenetic reprogramming takes place. Reprogramming means the
erasure and reestablishment of the epigenetic marks, namely DNA methylation,
affecting either somatic either germ cells.</p>

<p>There are two main
sensitive periods during development: the first during  the  pre-implantation period of embryo in the  placenta; and the second happens during
primordial germ cell development, which occur from mid gestation embryo till
the gametes are developed (puberty).<br /></p>

<p>The treatment could
affect reprogramming of  DNA and ulterior
gene expression. When substances like synthetic pharmaceuticals or their
metabolites enter a germ cell they can affect germline development in  different ways. Moreover, taking a drug that
affects epigenetic machinery during sensitive periods  regarding germ cells would affect next
generations. <span>As there is  a differential
resetting of DNA methylation in spermatogenesis vs oogenesis treatment impacts may
have gender specificity.</span><br /></p><p></p></div>
