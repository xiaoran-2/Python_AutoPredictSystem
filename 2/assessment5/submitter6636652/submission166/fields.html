    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">1. In normal cells, the CpG islands are kept free of DNA methylation at specific loci within a gene especially at the promoter regions of the gene.<br />2. Cancer cells have hypermethylation of the CpG islands at specific loci within the gene especially at the promoter regions resulting in silencing of tumor suppressor genes.<br />3. In cancer cells, CpG hypermethylation at the promoter region of the tumor suppressor genes result in the silencing of the genes giving rise to unregulated proliferation of the hypermethylated cells which has a competitive advantage over the other normal cells.<br />4. In normal cells, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are methylated.<br />5. In cancer cells, CpGs at the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hypomethylated. <br />6. DNA methylation disruption at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements alter the stability and the expression of genes resulting in cancers. Hypomethylation of repeats for instance makes them not to be densely packed into heterochromatin like they will normally be thus predisposing them to illegitimate recombination between repeats , the repeats can also be activated and then make a copy of themselves and then transpose thereby disrupting the coding region of a gene or can also result in activation of neighbouring gene or genes. So as a result of disruption in the DNA methylation you can have abnormal karyoptypes due to genomic instability resulting in deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><pre><code>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer and a good analogy is that of the H19/Igf2 imprint cluster. 
*Where the paternal allele ICR is the one that is normally methylated and when this happens, the methylation spreads to the H19 gene and its silenced, the enhancer region thus activates the Igf2 resulting in its expression. 
*On the other hand, the maternal ICR is usually unmethylated however the ICR is insulated by the CTCF which prevents the preferential activation of the Igf2 by the enhancer and thus the H19 is activated instead.
*Relating this to Wilm's tumor which is a rare kidney tumor that primarily affects children, the etiology as relating to the ICRs is that the maternal ICR is methylated similar to what exist in the paternal chromosome(resembling a uniparental disomy) therefore resulting in the expression of Igf2 on both the maternal and paternal chromosomes.
*Igf2(insulin-like growth factor) is a foetal growth promoter(Proto-oncogene)and normally should be expressed in the paternal chromosome but if expressed in both can result in unregulated excessive growth which often seen in pre-neoplastic tissues( seen early in tumorigenesis)</code></pre><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. Decitabine belongs to the class of DNMT1 inhibitor<br />2. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which when incorporated into the DNA upon replication and then when the DNMT1 comes to bind to the nucleotide to copy the DNA methylation to the daughter strand, DNMT is bound irreversibly and cannot be released and thus results in methylation depleted daughter cells.<br />3. The action and therapeutic effect of Decitabine is solely dependent on dividing cells because of its ability to irreversibly bind to DNMT and prevent methylation of daughter cells. Cancer cells are dividing more rapidly in the body and will be more affected because they are replicating more. Decitabine is very effective for Haematological malignancies since they are largely dependent on hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes thus hypomethylation of the tumor suppressors is induced in the daughter cells by Decitabine resulting in replication reduction.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that lasts beyond the period of drug treatment<br />* The reason for this is that the epigenetic machinery is mitotically heritable and the epigenetic marks are passed from daughter cells to grand- daughter cells until such epigenetic marks are cleared and thus when DNA methylation is altered using drugs the resulting daughter cells inherit the altered epigenetic marks that continues in that cell lineage even in the absence of the drug of treatment..<br />* These established epigenetic marks are only cleared and reset during the sensitive periods of development which is the period of development that are sensitive to environmental signals.<br />*These sensitive periods of development includes the early embryonic period, primordial germ cells period and around the pre-pubertal period of gametogenesis<br />*During the above sensitive periods of development, i will want to avoid drugs that alter DNA methylation because early in embyrogenesis the methylation on maternal and paternal gametes are cleared and reset as well as during primordial germ cells period, IAPs maintain there methylation, imprints are only cleared and reset during the primordial germ cells stage. So any alteration can result in further tumorigenesis.</div>
