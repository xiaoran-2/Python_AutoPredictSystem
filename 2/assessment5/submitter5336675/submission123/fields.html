    <h1>Submission 123 from Anon (session_user_id: a9e0ff66371c5fcb54e9ebd53f4ef0168aee3e89)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a so-called DNA-demethylase agent aiming for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes - DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors). The idea is that cancer cells hypermethylise cancer suppressor genes, hence when these hypermethylated genes are demethylised, they regain their function - a process called DNA methyltransferase. DNMTi depends on cell division and the alterations are irreversible. Since cancer cells are replicating more, they are also more severely targeted. Important, though, when supplying the drug, that the dose shouldn't be too high. Partly because of the toxicity, of the DNMTi, and because it is not in the anti-neoplastic effect range, anymore. Long-term side-effects are unclear, but short term improvement is apparent. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is one of the regulatory systems of genes. Methylation makes it harder for the transcription mechanism to bind to the DNA, hence gene expression is suppressed. CpG islands are sequences of CG nucleic acids, following each other multiple times. These islands, often preceeding genes, are more often than not methylated. When these islands are heavily methylated the gene expression is suppressed. Cancerous cells invert the methylation of CpG islands (i.e. normally methylated CGIs become demethylised, whereas unmethylised CGIs become methylated). This inversion, can, imply that oncogenes are overexpressed, whereas onco suppressing genes are suppressed - hence cancer cells will divide more rapidly. Parts within genes have multiple repetitive elements (repeats) - i.e. copies of exons. These repeats are, normally, heavily methylated so their expression is limited. In contrast with CGIs, which are demethylated in cancerous cells, DNA methylation in interregions are heavily demethylated in cancerous cells resulting in overexpressing of those exons. This overexpression of repetitive elements results in a vast amount of proteins and regulatory RNAs which interupt the normal function. Also resulting in excess DNA which is exerted out of the cell into the blood stream. If, on the other hand, that repeats are hypomethylated, this may result in genomic instability. Genomic instability may result in an incorrect number of chromosomal copies in a cell, deletions of parts of chromosomes and reciprocal translocation (i.e. incorrect 'mergence' of chromosomes).<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation of the paternal allele has a methylated region (ICR) between Igf2 and H19 (also H19 has CpGs). The enhancers, following the H19 gene, act backwards, but cannot bind to the region just before H19 so the enhancers acts more distantly, resulting in activation of Igf2. The maternal allele does not have methylation of the imprinted control region before the H19. Instead CTCF is binding on the ICR resulting in activation of H19. Loss of imprinting of the control region results in a hypermethylation of the ICR region in the materal allele, just like the paternal one. This allele, normally, is only expressed from the paternal allele. Now both the maternal as the paternal cell transcribe Igf2, which is a growth promoting hormone during early development. Overexpression of this allele results in excess creation of cells, resulting in cancerous development. H19 is a growth suppressor used to conserve energy for the mother, whereas Igf2 is a growth stimulator, counteracting H19, from the fathers' side to make the child grow. When this balance is disrupted - i.e. by disabling H19 - cell growth is out of control.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that change DNA methylation will persist beyond the original administration of the drugs, since DNA methylation is maintained after cell division. Hence up, or down, regulation due to DNA methylation will last indefinitely. Although this might be helpful, it may also have unintended consequences. When cells are stem, Omnipotent or pluripotent, we may not wish to activated genes, since they may be activated by cell-types that should not express those regions. These periods are called the sensitive periods. Especially in the embryonic stage lost of methylisation is transcripted. Sensitive periods, further, differ between sexes, especially while gamete development. Females create all their gametes before birth, whereas males throughout their lives, but especially important is the period until adolescence - i.e. around 12. Here alterations to DNA methylation may be passed on to their gameters, hence their children. During developmental stage, decreasing numbers of pluripotent cells exist so this sensitive period decreases steadily.<br /></div>
