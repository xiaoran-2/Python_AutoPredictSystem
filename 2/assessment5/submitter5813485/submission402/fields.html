    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands is an epigenetic event which is associated with gene silencing. In the normal cells, the CpG islands tend to be hypomethylated, while they are more likely to be hypermethylated, in the cancer cells. As the CpG islands are always found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, DNA methylation at CpG islands can silence the suppressor genes epigenetically which will make cells more easily to divide rapidly and eventually process to cancer. <br />The normal function of DNA mehtylation in  intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity and stability to avoid abnormal karyotype, transcriptional intergerence, illegitimate recombination, etc. In contrast of CpG island which are usual ly unmethylated in normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated. But they are hypomethylated in cancer cells, while the CGIs are hypermethylated. As a result of the aberrant DNA methylation, the genome become instable and the instability leads to cancer in the end.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the maternal allele, ICR which is unmethylated can be bound by an insulator protein, CTCF. CTCF's binding insulate the<i> Igf2 </i>from the downsteam enhancers. So in this case, the insulators effectively act as an enhancer-blocker and these enhancers are free to act on<i> H19</i> and enhance its expression. On the contrast, this ICR is methylated on the paternal allele which means that CTCF is no longer able to bind and the enhancer can act on Igf2. What's more, DNA methylation on ICR on paternal allele spreads to <i>H19</i> promoter to silence<i> H19</i>. For the reasons above,<i> Igf2</i> is expressed only from the paternal allele, not maternal allele. With loss of imprinting In Wilm's tumor, ICR on the maternal allele will be hypermethylated as well, and <i>Igf2 </i>will be expressed from both paternal and maternal allele. And dose of Igf2 will be doubled and expression of<i> H1</i>9 will be down-regulated compared to which in the normal cells, Over-expression of Igf2 which is a growth promoting hormone and down-regulation of H19 which is a tumor suppressor gene are associated with the development of cancer.  <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There are broad classes of epigenetic drugs, including DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi), histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). histone methyltransferase inhibitors (HMTi), histone acetyltransferase inhibitors (HAT), and histone demethylase inhibitors (HDMi). Decitabine is classified as DNMTi, which means it is a DNA-demethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNAmethyltransferase. Like 5-azacytidine, decitabine is cytidine analog and can be incorporated into DNA upon replication. And when DNA methyltransferase come along to bind it and can no longer be released, the methylation will be copied to the daughter strand thereby causing demethylation in that sequence. As DNMTi are replication dependent, cancer cells which are always dividing more rapidly than other cells in the body will be severely affected by Decitabine.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic state such as DNA methylation is mitotically heritable to all the daughter cells. That's why altering DNA methylation can have enduring effect lasting beyond the period of drug treatment. Sensitive periods means the periods when the environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup and are sensitive to the epigenetic control. The first sensitive period is from primordial germ cell development to the production of mature eggs and sperm. The second sensitive period is the pre-implantation period and early post-implantation period. Both of these periods are most sensitive to changes in the environment, including drug treatment. As we learnt in this course, epigenetic marks which can be easily changed by drugs during sensitive periods are transmitted from parent to offspring through the gametes. For the reasons above, treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.<br /><br /></div>
