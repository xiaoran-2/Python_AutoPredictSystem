    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">In cancer, DNA methylation is altered in several ways. First, at CpG islands, normally is free from methylation because they are very dense, is hypermethylated by DNA methylation in cancer cells, and the underlying genes of the CpG islands are typically silenced. This leads to cancer because CpG islands are promoters for tumor suppressor genes, therefore the genes silenced by hypermethylation are these tumor suppression that are supposed to stop cancer proliferation, and with these genes silenced, the tumor cell is free to reproduce asexually in the body. Normally, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in DNA are used for chromatin regulation in gene regulation, which is maintained by DNA methylaton. However in cancer, DNA methylation is disrupted and intergenic regions and repetitive elements do not properly regulate chromatin, which means that any cells reproduced from the tumor cells cannot be regulated back into normal cells, which contributes to cancer by making its proliferation immortal and absolute. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The disruption of imprinting genes can contribute to causing cancer in a cell, for example in a H19/Igf2 histone cluster. To begin, methylation patterns of the paternal and maternal alleles determine Igf2 expression. IncRNA processes in imprinting genes is vital for how the paternal allele determines Igf2 expresion, meanwhile the maternal allele depends on p-53 induced IncRNA, which is not as dependent on imprinting. In Wilm’s tumor, the H19/Igf2 histone cluster is disrupted because the imprinting from the paternal allele was disrupted</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methylation agent that inhibits DNA methylation in order to regulate epigenetic systems and histones. This regulation of epigenetic traits that maintain the cell, such as tumor suppressor genes and apoptosis genes which therefore strengthens anti-tumor agents in a cell, this gives the cell an anti- tumor effect. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation causes a genome wide loss and regional gain in DNA methylation which causes deregulation and genetic instability and the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. A sensitive period is a time of important genetic imprinting during fetal development, such as blastocyt and organogenesis during fetal development in pregnancy. Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because any alterations made then are permanent for the patient and their offspring, and any mistakes, alterations, or complications could seriously harm the patient and their offspring, and even their grandchildren for long term. <br /><br /></div>
