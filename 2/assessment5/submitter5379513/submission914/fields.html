    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is associated with silencing of genes, i.e the more methylation present, the less likely the gene is to be expressed. CpG islands are very often found in the promoter regions of genes. When methylated, they turn off the promoter thereby silencing the gene.<br />In cancer, CpG islands could be hypermethylated (be more methylated than usual), meaning that the associated gene will be silenced. If this gene is a tumour suppressor gene, then silencing it means that a tumour can then flourish uninhibited.<br />Conversely, CpG islands could be hypomethylated (be less methylated than usual), meaning that the gene becomes active. If this gene is an oncogene, then a tumour may develop.<br /><br />The genome contains a large amount of non-coding regions called introns in-between the coding regions known as exons. Ideally, introns should be switched off, i.e methylated, while exons should be unmethylated. If intronic DNA is hypomethylated, then errors can occur during DNA replication that can adversely affect the protein formed. If this occurs in a tumour suppressor gene, then the gene may be inactivated and a tumour can result.<br /><br />The genome also contains repetitive elements. These elements have the ability to transpose, or move positions randomly in the genome. They can insert themselves into genes (e.g tumour suppressor genes) and inactivate them. Because of their deleterious effects, they are kept well methylated (i.e switched off). If they become hypomethylated, then cancer can result.<br /><br />In cancer, there's aberrant methylation of CpG islands, and hypomethylation of intergenic region (introns) and repetitive elements.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster there's the Igf2 gene, the imprint control region (ICR), the H19 gene, and enhancers downstream of this cluster.<br />In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated. In this state, CTCF can bind to it. When this happens, the enhancers cannot access the Igf2 gene, but they can access the H19 gene. Therefore, H19 is expressed but Igf2 is silenced.<br />In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated so CTCF cannot bind to it. Therefore, the enhancers can access the Igf2 gene and so Igf2 is expressed.<br />In Wilm's tumour, there's hypermethylation at the ICRs meaning that the ICR on both the maternal and paternal alleles are methylated. Therefore, Igf2 is expressed from both alleles, so there's twice as much Igf2 than normal. This contributes to cancer because Igf2 is a growth promoting protein, and one of the characteristics of cancer cells is non-stop growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). DNA methyltransferases (e.g Dnmt1) catalyse the addition of methyl groups to DNA, i.e they catalyse DNA methylation. If their action is blocked, then the DNA cannot be methylated, meaning that they cannot set up the necessary epigenetic marks required for proper gene function.<br />Decitabine, like other drugs in its class, is a nucleoside analogue. It is incorporated into the growing DNA chain during replication just like the regular nucleosides. However, when Dnmt1 comes to lay down its epigenetic mark (i.e methylation), decitabine binds it irreversibly, in effect stopping the enzyme from catalyzing any other methylation reaction. One could say that the drug inactivates DNMTs, thereby resulting in genomic instability caused by genome-wide hypomethylation.<br />Because tumour cells are rapidly replicating, they are affected by the drug much more than a normal cell would, and since genomic instability can cause cell death, decitabine is anti-tumourigenic.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Proper DNA methylation patterns need to be maintained in the genome. Genes that should be silenced need to maintain high levels of methylation, and those that should be active need low levels of methylations. Perturbations in these methylation patterns can lead to disease (e.g cancer). The effects of such perturbations can be long-lasting, for instance if they result in cancer (because cancer cells are immortal).<br />There are two sensitive periods during development: during early development before implantation in the uterus, and during primordial germ cell (PGC) development in the gonads. They are called sensitive periods because  they are periods when epigenetic marks are being established.<br />Given that epigenetic marks are being established, and aberrant methylation patterns can lead to disease, it is not a good idea to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods. </div>
