    <h1>Submission 359 from Anon (session_user_id: e009d06cff665ae69bb8e9fa6d8cd3ea9ad260e2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an DNMT (DNA methyltransferase) inhibitor. It irreversible attaches the methyltransferase to the daughter DNA strand when a cell is replicating and therefore methylation is not transmitted to the daughter cell and methyltransferases become less and less. The effect on cancer cells is, that those are fast reproducing cells and therefore will be affected the most if DNA methyltransferases are missing and cannot be used anymore in DNA methylation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands are predominantly de- or hypomethylated due to the fact that they often contain the promoters of gens. However in cancer cells CpG are becoming hypermethylated. This often goes along with the silencing of tumor suppressor genes.<br />A similar swap in methylation can be seen in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. However these areas are hypermethylated in normal cells and become more demethylated in cancer cells. This hypomethylation of the genome works in favor of cancer cells due to the progressing genome instability that especially comes along with open euchromation that is due to unmethylated repetitive areas. In case of intergenic regions cryptic promoters tend to be more active in cancer cells due to the lower level of methylation, too. This often goes along with higher expression of tumor inducing factors.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The function of imprinting is that certain
genes are silent only on the maternal or paternal chromosome. In case of Igf2
the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated in the paternal allele which
leaves Igf2 to be expressed due to enhancers downstream of the ICR; whereas in
the maternal allele, where the ICR is unmethylated, those enhancers influence
the also maternally unmethylated H19 gene downstream Igf2. Due to this, the
enhancers do not interact with Igf2 and Igf2 is therefore not expressed. <br />
In summary this means, that in case of Igf2 only the paternal allele is
expressed in a normal cell.<br />
However, if imprinting is disrupted in this cluster, which means the ICR is
methylated on both chromosomes, H19 is not expressed at all while Igf2 is
overexpressed. This leads to an overdose of Igf2 and a so called Wilm's tumor
can be caused by it.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is passed on to daughter
cell. This means that an alteration of the epigenome in form of methylation or
demethylation will be passed on to daughter cells until they are actively
erased or reestablished. This can be after multiple cell divisions or never at
all again.<br />
In sensitive periods where certain methylation patterns are vital, such an
effect caused by a drug could be very destructive. There are multiple sensitive
periods such as in organ development or embryo implantation etc. The must
impactful however would be when Germ cells are formed in an embryo or when egg
or sperm cells are developing in adults. These are the time points where a
wrong methylation could be fixed to the germ line and passed on to future
generations. Therefore pregnant woman and especially children before and during
puberty should not be treated with drugs that might have an impact on these sensitive
periods.</span><br /></p></div>
