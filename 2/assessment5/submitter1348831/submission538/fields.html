    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands are usually unmethylated (i.e., hypomethylated), in contrast, repetitive elements, introns, and intergenic regions are hypermethylated.  CpG islands are especially common in imprinted genes.  CpG islands are often associated with the promoters of genes.  When these island are methylated the effect may silence the associated gene.<br /><br />When certain CpG islands are hypermethylated this will have various effects depending upon the tumor type.  This abnormal methylation pattern may arise from environmental or epigenetic causes.  For example, hypermethylation of CpG islands in some cases may act to silence the expression of tumor suppressor genes resulting in an increased rate of cell division and perhaps formation of a tumor.  Although this epimutation will be mitotically heritable, it is not a permanent genetic mutation, and thus could be reversed by drug therapy.  However, the effect of DNA methylation varies among different cancers.<br /><br />Normally repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypermethylated.  This acts to stabilize the genome by silencing repeats and preventing transposition.  Intergenic methylation can act to silence cryptic splice sites or transcription initiation sites that might lead to transcriptional interference. Similarly, methylation of repetitive elements can prevent transposition, silence strong promoters or cryptic promoters to avoid transcriptional interference, and prevent illegitimate recombination.<br /><br />Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic intervals will lead to genomic instability.  This can result in illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of cryptic promoters, and transposition.  An example of the consequences of these types of mutations is that the deletion of DNMT1 in certain mouse tissues results in genomic instability and cancer.  <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes in methylation of certain imprinted genes in mammals can lead to the expression of oncogenes or the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. An example of this can be seen with the H19/Igf2 cluster.  The genes Igf2 and H19 are differentially expressed on the maternal and paternal alleles in a normal cell. <br /><br />On the maternal allele in a normal cell, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind to it and insulating it from downstream enhancers.  H19 is affected by these enhancers and is expressed, but the CTCF bound to the ICR blocks the enhancers and silences Igf2.  On the imprinted paternal allele, the ICR is methylated inhibiting binding of CTCF.  The enhancers can act on Igf2 and it is expressed.  methylation at the ICR spreads downstream to the H19 locus silencing it.  You get expression of H19 from the maternal and Igf2 from the paternal strand.<br /><br />Hypermethylation of the maternal allele at the ICR results in suppression of H19 and expression of Igf2.  This hypermethylation of the maternal ICR gives rise to over expression of the Igf2 growth factor and can result in an early childhood cancer of the kidney called Wilm’s tumor.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an FDA approved drug that is used in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  It is marketed as Dacogen.  Decitabine acts as a hypomethylating agent by inhibiting DNMT (DNA methyltransferase). It is a nucleoside analog which gets incorporated into the cells DNA during replication.<br /><br />During methylation of DNA at replication, when DNA methyltransferase binds to the DNA molecule to methylate the daughter DNA strand, the DNMT is irreversibly bound to the decitabine.  Thus, further DNA methylation is inhibited and as the cell divides CpG islands have less methylation, that is, they are hypomethylated.<br /><br />Since cancer cells divided more rapidly than healthy cells, the effect is greater on cancer cells. However, the long-term impact of this drug and this mechanism of action in general is poorly known. With AML there is hypomethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores. Decitabine appears to cause reactivation of tumor suppressor genes by hypomethylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation, are mitotically heritable.  So as cancer (or normal) cells divide and multiply those epigenetic marks can be passed to the daughter cells.  DNMT enzymes mediate initial methylation and maintain methylation when DNA is replicated.  Thus, this would give drugs that inhibit DNA methyltransferases, like decitabine, a lasting influence through the effect on DNA methylation.  The degree and location of DNA methylation can act to either silence or activate specific genes; for example, genes related to growth or tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br />There are however, periods during development when it might be problematic to use drugs that effect epigenetic marks.  Certain times in development are sensitive periods when epigenetic reprogramming is taking place, that is, when many epigenetic marks are being removed and reset.  These periods include early development (pre-implantation development) of the embryo and when male or female germ cells are developing.  Since many of these marks involve DNA methylation it would be unwise to treat patients (i.e., children and pregnant women) with a drug that affects DNMT and could interfere with epigenetic reprogramming.</div>
