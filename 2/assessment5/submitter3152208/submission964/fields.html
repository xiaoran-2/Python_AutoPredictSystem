    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the process by which a 5-methyl group is added to
the DNA. In mammals the process occurs almost exclusively at cytosines followed by guanines. Therefore the two bases form the so called CpG
dinucleotide or CpG islands. The enzymes that lay down the methyl group are known as DNMT3A and DNMT3B. Generally the CpG islands
throughout the genome are unmethylated, but some of them are found methylated and this process is associated with gene silencing. For example, the
X chromosome inactivation involves DNA methylation of the CpG islands.</p>

<p>DNA methylation is also found at intergenic regions and repetitive
elements, that are patterns of nucleic acids that occur in multiple copies
throughout the genome. The methylation to these particular regions helps
to maintain genomic integrity or stability, inducing their silencing and
protecting for example against undesirable recombinations between chromosomes.</p>

<p>There are two types of DNA methylation abnormalities: the DNA
hypermethylation, that is locus specific, and the genome-wide hypomethylation.</p>

<p>If we consider cancer, contrary to the normal conditions, the CpG
islands are found often methylated, whereas the rest of the genome, including the repetitive
elements and the introns, are hypomethylated. This is because CpG islands are usually
localized in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Therefore in cancer cells
these genes are inactivated, allowing them to divide more rapidly, or to be
more resistant to cell death, all characteristics of the tumor
development.</p>

<p>Hypomethylation occurs mainly at repetitive elements, with some
consequences like illegitimate recombination between repeats or jumping throughout
the genome. This leads to transcriptional aberration in the surrounding
regions. The overall outcome is a general genomic instability due to additional
deletions, insertions or translocations, that can eventually lead to a cancer development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic reprogramming is the process by which remodeling of
epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, occurs during mammalian development. It is divided into two phases: the first one during preimplantation development, and the second
during primordial germ cell development. After fertilization, the paternal
genome is actively and rapidly demethylated. In contrast, the maternal genome is
demethylated more slowly. Imprinted genes are genes whose expression occurs from only one
allele, depending on its parental origin. These genes undergo reprogramming in
the primordial germ cells. An example is represented by the gene cluster H19/Igf2,
present on the chromosome 11, that is unmethylated on the maternal allele, and
methylated on the paternal allele, therefore is paternally imprinted. H19 is a gene for a long noncoding RNA. Igf2 is insulated from
downstream enhancers by the binding of the CTCF insulator protein. DNA
methylation at imprint control region blocks CTCF binding, inducing the
silencing of H19 and activation of Igf2. If the maternal copy of the chromosome
is replaced with an extra paternal copy (condition called unipaternal disomy-UPD),
there is an epigenetic disruption that leads to fetal and postnatal overgrowth,
because of an overdose of Igf2, and predisposition to embryonic or childhood
cancers, like the Wilms’ tumour that affects the kidneys.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine, commonly used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the
precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia, is a hypomethylating agent,
therefore reduces DNA methylation. It is a nucleoside analog that is
incorporated in the DNA molecule during the replication phase. So it binds
irreversibly to DNA methyltransferases, inhibiting the action of these enzymes.
In cancer in fact there is an overactivity of the enzymes that lay down methyl
groups in the genome. This leads for example to the silencing of surrounding
genes like tumour suppressors, that normally protect the cells against cancer
growth, controlling cell cycle and apoptosis. The purpose of using decitabine
is therefore to repristinate the effect of tumor suppressors.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the main modifications that go under the
name of epigenetic process and is considered an epigenetic mark because it is at the base of different
phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of
heterochromatin. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions induces their
silencing. An exception is represented by CpG islands, regions that are found mainly
in promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept unmethylated
independently of their activity state.  However, in cancer cells, promoter
CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the corrispective
genes. When the latter are tumour suppressor, this is a big problem for the
cancer development. Epigenetic control is important throughout development, from the
single cell fertilized egg, the zygote, through pre-implantation development.
There are some sensitive periods of reprogramming that involve the resetting of
epigenetic marks post-implantation. As reported in the article, epigenetic changes are transmitted during cell division to the daughter cells and so on in the next generation until they are removed. Younger patients with cancer, that have developing germ cells during sensitive periods, should not be treated with these molecules. It would be very
risky,  because they could inhibit the
epigenetic machinery.</p><p> </p><p>
