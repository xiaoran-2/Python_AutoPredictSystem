    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the CpG islands
(which are commonly found in promoter regions) are <b>hypo</b>methylated.
This does not necessarily mean these regions are active.  However, in
a cancer cell<b> hyper</b>methylation
of these CpG islands occurs which silences the associated gene.  This
is specifically an issue when the gene associated with the
hypermethylated CpG island is a tumor suppressor gene. In this case,
the cell would replicate faster/more frequently than it should.  DNA
methylation is mitotically heritable, so as this cancer cell divides,
the hypermethylation would be passed on to each new cell, and thus
you would have a tumor.  These cells could then effectively
out-compete healthy cells, since they would replicate quickly and be
consuming nutrient resources faster than the neighboring cells.  
</p>

<p>In a
normal cell,  repetitive elements and intergenic regions are
<b>hyper</b>methylated –
both are effectively silenced in order to maintain genomic integrity.
Methylation of intergenic regions reduces the risk of insertions,
deletions, and translocations within the genome at these sites since
they are of particularly high risk of these types of mutations. 
Methylation of repetitive elements reduces the risk of illegitimate
recombination between non-homologous chromosomes (since the repeats
would allow for areas of compatibility where non-homologues could
“match up”), and also prevents them from “jumping”
(translocating) to other regions which could disrupt neighboring
genes and would therefore be mutagenic.  In cancer, repetitive
elements and intergentic regions are <b>hypo</b>methylated.
  This allows for the above mentioned disruptions to occur, and for
cancer tumors to develop.  In particular, hypomethylation of these
regions has been linked to subsequent disruptions in the cell
replication timing/control genes– and we are back to cells becoming
cancerous due to disruption of the cell cycle machinery and
growing/replicating uncontrollably.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When
imprinting is disrupted, this can lead to either an overexpression of
certain genes or an underexpression.  In the example of the H19/Igf2
cluster, imprinting is critical.  In this case, the
paternally-derived allele is methylated at the imprint control region
and the maternally-derived allele is unmethylated at the imprint
control region (ICR).  For the paternally derived allele, the
methylation of the ICR prevents the CTCF protein from binding which
causes the enhancers located downstream from the ICR to act on Igf2
(which is an oncogene).  For the maternally derived allele, since the
ICR is unmethylated, the CTCF protein can bind to the ICR which
insulates Igf2 from being acted on by the downstream enhancers. 
These enhancers instead act on H19. 
</p>

<p>In
the case of Wilm's tumor, the imprinting is lost and the ICR on both
alleles is methylated.  This causes overexpression of Igf2, since
both the maternally and paternally derived alleles express Igf2 since
the CTCF protein cannot bind to either allele's ICR and insulate Igf2
from being expressed. This disruption of imprinting is
cancer-contributing because IGF2 is an oncogene and the cell is
getting a double-dose of expression of this growth-promoting gene.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is  a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).  DNA
methyltransferases (DNMT) are enzymes that allow for the methylation
patterns to be copied from a parent strand of DNA to a daughter
strand of DNA.  As cells are preparing to undergo cell division, DNMT
will bind to the replicating DNA during S of Interphase in order to
methylate the daughter strand based on the parental strand's
methylation pattern. Decitabine will irreversably bind DNMTs, which
inhibits their ability to copy the methylation pattern from parent to
daughter.  This works particularly well on those tumors that exhibit
tumor-suppressor gene hypermethylation. The hypermethylation is
silencing the tumor-suppressor gene(s), which are genes that inhibit
cell growth/division.  By inhibiting this hypermethylation from being
copied from one cell to the next during  cancer cell replication, you
can reduce tumor growth by allowing the tumor-suppressor genes to
again be expressed.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA
methylation is an incredibly stable epigentic mark, since the
patterns of methylation can be copied consistently from parental DNA
to daughter DNA by DNMTs, thus allowing for these epigenetic marks to
be mitotically heritable.  DNA methylation will persist through cell
generations until actively erased, thus having an enduring impact on
the epigenome.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sensitive
periods are when epigenetic marks are being actively reprogrammed.
This is when lineage-specific  epigenetic marks are removed, and when
pluripotent epigenetic marks and an open chromatin state are
restored.  These sensitive periods include primordial germ cell
development (spermatogenesis and oogenesis) and the pre-implantation
period of early embryonic development. For males, treatment during
adolescence when germ cells are developing could have effects on
subsequent generations (as seen by the Overkalix study) and for
females during  early adolescence as well as preconception and during
 pregnancy (as seen in the Overkalix and Dutch famine studies).  In 
mice, we have seen treatments that effect epigenetic reprogramming
during pregnancy to cause issues including reduced fertility in
subsequent generations and even offspring death if DNMT is disrupted
globally.  So, treatment of a female during early adolescence (as in 
males), pre-conception and during pregnancy could all have negative
impacts.</p>
