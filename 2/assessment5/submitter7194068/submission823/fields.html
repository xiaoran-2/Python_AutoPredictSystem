    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>














</p><p>Decitabine belongs to the
DNA Methylation inhibitors and DNA-demethylating agents, which are nucleoside
analogue meaning they act on the nucleuses mainly. They are division dependent
and replication is a must, where when they are integrated into the DNA, and the
DNMT1 comes along to bind the nucleotide to copy it to the daughter strandà it binds irreversibly so that it can no longer be replicated. When hypermethylation occur with cancer cells à this blocks
the tumor suppressor genes that regulate gene expression in the cell and the
cell division becomes unregulated and this will support cancer. <span>That explains how Decitabine act on cancer cell since this class
of drugs are division dependent and act on cancer cells, which undergo increase
replication. This leads to the anti- tumor effect when it interferes with
the DNA methylation as it restores the tumor suppresser genes and this will
control cell replication accordingly.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the DNA at CpG islands
is hypo-methylated, which promote the activation of tumor suppressor cells and
prevent cancer from developing. However, this is disrupted in cancer cell through
epigenetic mutation, as there is reciprocal switch between where the DNA
methylation is found. The DNA methylation at the CpG islands is mostly
hyper-methylated. DNA methylation is considered one of the insults to the DNA.
In other words, hyper-methylation at CpG islands will lead to the inactivation
or blocking of tumor suppressor genes. This will allow the cancer cells to be
promoted over the normal cell and indeed it will divide more rapidly and control
the cell and this is contributing to the development of cancer accordingly.</p>

<span>      On the other hand, the genome is
mostly made of the inetgenic regions and repetitive elements and DNA is found
to be hyper-methylated in intergenic regions and repetitive element which
prevent recombination between repeats as they are heavily methylated (hetrochromatanized)-
in other words more closely packaged in a way that prevent recombination. In cancer
cell the DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive element is disrupted and is
found to be mainly hypo-methylated this result in genomic instability. This
genomic instability occur as a result of the alignment and misalignments of repeats
and this Illegitimate recombination between repeats is a result of the open
chromatin (euchromatinized) which is not closely packaged (allowing the illegitimate recombination to occur). In addition, the
hypo-methylation of repeats will lead to activation and the repeat will make
copies of them causing several problems. Such as activating neighboring genes
and transposition or activation of promoters and this leads to transcriptional
abnormalities and genomic instability accordingly in neighboring genes/regions.
This contribute to cancer as it result is deletions, insertions, and
reciprocal translocation. Mainly, Genomic instability contributes to cancer
ultimately</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Imprint control region
(ICR) on the paternal allele is methylated, which will lead to making the
enhancers act on IGF2, where it is not inbited by CTCF because binding doesn’t
occur. As a result the IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele accordingly. </p><p>While, the ICR on the maternal allele are un-methylated, à CTCF binds its insulator elements à the enhancers will act on H19 à Igf2 will not be expressed, as it will be silenced for the
maternal allele.<br /></p><p>In Wilms disease, there is
loss of imprinting with hyper-methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele àleads to expression of Igf2. Along with the Igf2 expressed from
paternal there is an overexpression of Igf2 compared to the normal cell
situation. This hyper-methylation of ICR on both maternal and paternal allele
resulting in over expression of IGF2 will lead to the development of wilm’s
tumor accordingly, since Igf2 is a growth promoting gene.</p>

<p>The disruption
of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer, as it simply seen
in early stages of tumorgenesis and characterized by over-expression of growth
promoting genes and silencing of growth restricting genes as a result of DNA
methylation alterations (either hypo or hyper). <span> </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Altering DNA
methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome where it is mitotically
heritable and epigenetic modifications are replicated during
cell division to daughter strands and continue until they are actively erased permanently.
Therefore, epigenetic therapies can be targeted to change these epigenetic
modifications by silencing growth promoter genes and activating tumor
suppressor genes, for example, which will result in interfering and stopping
the development of cancer rather than killing the cell. With epigenetic
therapies we are reminding the cells of what it is supposed to be and do, these
therapies seems to be more promising on the long run where epigenetic
modifications will continue after cell replication and altering
DNA methylation will continue and have an enduring effects on the epigenome.</p>

<p><span>        Sensitive periods are when
epigenetic marks are removed during epigenetic reprogramming and it happens
during the two waves – primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development when the </span>clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks occurs,
and <span>new epigenetic marks are established rather than maintained.  Treating patients during sensitive
periods would be inadvisable because it</span><span> leads to altered
epigenetics and change in gene expression affecting patients negatively while
also altering phenotype in such a critical phase.</span></p></div>
