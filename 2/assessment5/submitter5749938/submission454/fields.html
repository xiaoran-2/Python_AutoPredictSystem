    <div class="field-value">Methylated DNA is transcriptionally less active or simply say, methylation <i>'mutes'</i> the DNA, and is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X 
chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. Though other processes other than methylation do also exist simultaneously within the chromatin.<br />In normal cells, CpG islands in promoter region are generally unmethylated, while other individual CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome (intergenic and repetitive elements) tend to be methylated. But this methylation profile is often inverted in cells that become carcinogenic.<br />Hence In cancers, CpG islands become hypermethylated, while intergenic and repetitive elements
 throughout the genome tend to be unmethylated, so in cancers cells, simply put, a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation occurs. The methylation of CpG islands in the promoter region suppresses many important tumor suppressor genes, so the check and balance system is disrupted and cells continue to divide with freedom. Intergenic and repetitive elements become unmethylated and active and there is loss of imprinting and reactivation of transposable elements.<br />The cause of this change in methylation patterns is many folds and the mutation of epigenetic enzymes is a key factor. Under different environmental stresses, radiations, drugs etc, these mutations in the enzymes lead to aberrant methylation patterns.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting, resulting in parent-of-origin-dependent gene 
expression, is mainly achieved by DNA methylation. IGF2 and H19, 
belonging to the same cluster of imprinted genes play a major role in fetal/placental 
growth<i>.</i><br /><div>It is seen that IGF2 is normally only transcribed from the paternal allele; as<i> <u>H19 is imprinted on the 'paternal' chromosome</u></i>. On the other hand, <i><u>IGF2 is 'maternally' imprinted</u></i>. <br />This maternal imprinting is lost in many tumors, including Wilm's tumor, leading to biallelic over-expression of the IGF2 gene and tumorogenesis.<br /></div><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (trade name: Dacogen)  is an analogue of the nucleoside 2’-deoxycytidine. It is
believed to exert its anti-tumor effects by direct incorporation into DNA and <em><u>inhibition of DNA
methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA</u></em> and apoptotic cell death in rapidly dividing
cells. Since, methylation <i>mutes </i>the DNA, so demethylation makes the genes active. These active tumor suppressor genes may promote restoration of function to genes
associated with control of cellular differentiation and
proliferation.<br />Currently, Decitabine is specifically indicated for the treatment of multiple
types of myelodysplastic syndromes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">It has been observed that the epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation patterns, are in heritable and passed on during cell division to daughter and 
granddaughter cells. so once erased, though,
 they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can
 effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all 
its cells.<br />On the other side, the same epigenetic changes caused by the variety of exogenous stimuli in normal population (of cells) can lead to detrimental effects too especially during the sensitive period. As we know, the <em>sensitive period</em> is a phase during which an 
organism/cells has heightened sensitivity to exogenous stimuli that are 
compulsory for their development. During these phases like 
embryogenesis, gametogenesis etc, when the changes occur in any part of 
the chromatin or epigenetics, these will be preserved in the remaining 
generation and can form the solid base for the tumorogenesis. Hence, treatment in the sensitive periods in not advised.<br /></div>
