    <div class="field-value">CpG islands in promoter regions of tumor-suppressing genes (TSG) are normally methylated only in very small amounts, however, in cancer, they undergo hypermethylation. The hypermethylation causes the gene to be silenced, and thus cancer ensues. In repetitive DNA elements and intergenic regions however, the opposite happens. It is hypomethylation that causes cancer. Hypomethylation in repetitive DNA elements is thought to be correlated with more unstable DNA structure. This instability is predisposed to genetic mutations and abnormalities. And this will lead to cancer.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2, because they are normally transmitted solely from the father, should have little or no methylation. The maternal Igf2 gene should be normally highly methylated because this is not transmitted. The opposite is true for H19 gene, which is transmitted solely from mother to offspring. However, there are cases in which Igf2, most especially from the mother, will not be methylated enough, and thus the Igf2 is biallelically expressed. In contrast, the H19 genes will experience an increase in methylation and thus would not be, or expressed parsimoniously. These epigenetic events will lead to Wilm's Tumor. The pathogenesis of Wilm's tumor is hypothesised in such a way that the Igf2 and the H19 are corregulated genes, which means that they are coordinated under one control structure. Damage to this control structure will lead to genomic instability and thus cause cancer.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. As discussed earlier, cancer can be caused by hypermethylated CpG islands on Tumor Suppressing Genes. DNA-demethylating agents work by inhibiting DNA methylation. If applied to hypermethylated CPG islands on TSG's, it might reverse cancer by allowing TSG's that prevent tumor development, to be expressed. Specifically, decitabine works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, the enzyme that catalyze the transfer of methyl groups to DNA.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As taught on the lectures, epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation can be transmitted from one cell generation to another. Cancer treatments that act on the genetic level thus can have a long-lasting effect on the cells that it acts on. And thus sensitive periods of development should be considered. Sensitive periods of development are periods during development in which the DNA are very vulnerable to damage. One such period is during early pregnancy. This would therefore mean that epigenetic drugs should not be used on pregnant women as they can have far-reaching effects not only on the fetus they are carrying, but also to the future offspring, as taught in the former lectures (i.e. Dutch famine, etc.)</div>
