    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands normally functions to silence the corresponding gene. Although there is genome-wide hypomethylation in cancer, DNA methylation at CpG islands is increased in cancer. DNA methylation at a CpG island can silence a tumor suppressor gene, providing one of the "hits" needed to transform a normal cell to cancer. <br /><br />One of the primary functions of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic stability. DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically methylated in normal cells but are often hypomethylated in cancer. This hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements can lead to genomic instability -- for example, illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation and transposition of repeats, or transcriptional aberration in neighboring genes. <br /><br />The effect of DNA methylation in cancer is context dependent. Some cancers are driven by tumor suppressor hypermethylation, so reducing DNA methylation decreases tumor formation; however, other cancer are driven by chromosomal instability, so reduced DNA methylation results in increased tumor formation. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated on the maternal allele. This causes Igf2 to be silent on the maternal allele because the unmethylated imprint control region on the maternal allele can be bound by CTCF, which blocks the enhancers from acting on Igf2. The imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele. This causes Igf2 to be expressed on the paternal allele because the methylated imprint control region on the paternal allele cannot be bound by CTCF, so the enhancers can act on Igf2. In cancer imprinting is disrupted -- there is methylation of the imprint control region on the maternal as well as the paternal allele. This causes Igf2 to be expressed from both the maternal and paternal alleles, so the cell has a double dose of Igf2, which is growth promoting. This double dose of Igf2 is associated with Wilm's tumor.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, specifically a DNA methyl-transferase inhibitor (DNMTi). Since some tumors are driven by hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, decitabine could reduce tumorigenesis in these tumors. Specifically, decitabine could have an anti-tumor effect if it inhibited methylation of a CpG island that when hypermethylated in tumor cells caused a tumor suppressor gene to be silenced. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, can be maintained through mitosis leading to lasting effects on the epigenome. So a drug that causes epigenetic changes could produce an effect after the period of treatment has ended. However, for this reason, one would want to avoid treating patients with such drugs during periods of epigenetic reprogramming know as sensitive periods. The sensitive periods of development are from primordial germ cell development to production of mature eggs and sperm, as well as, pre-implantation and early post-implantation. During these times of epigenetic reprogramming, the cells are most sensitive to environmental effects and similarly to drug effects. In the case of drug effects, these could result in adverse outcomes for the offspring of the treated individual.  </div>
