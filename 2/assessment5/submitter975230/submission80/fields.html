    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, the CpG islands are hypomethyllated (majority of the bases are not methyllated), and the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are usually hypermethyllated. However, in a cancer cell, this is usually the other way round (CpG islands are hypermethyllated, and the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hypomethyllated. DNA methyllation is a way to silence tumor supressive genes, so if the CpG island is methyllatedad, that can silence the tumor supressor genes, which contribute to the forming of the cancer. What is more, hypomethyllated intergenic regions and repetitive elements can cause further disruption of the normal cell cycle, becaus they are not silenced, and for eg long non-codig RNA transcription can occur more often. Because methyllation is mitotically heritable, the epimutations are rapidly selected, thus contributing to the spreading of the mutated epigenetic marks.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster is a subject to imprinting. Normally, the Igf2 gene from the paternal allele is expressed, while the same gene from the maternal allele is suressed. The H19 when methyllated (paternal allele) is not active, so the CTCF molecule that is regulated by the regions that can be found on the DNA upstream from the H19 location, are silenced as well. CTCF regulates the expression if Igf2, so on the paternal allele, because there is no CTCF to silence the Igf2 gene, it is expressed. However, on the maternal allele, the H19 is hypomethyllated, so it does not silence the CTCF complex, which in return silences the expression of the Igf2 gene that is on the maternal allele. In Wilm's tumor, both H19 genes are methyllated, which causes both Igf2 genes to be espressed, so the imprinting no longer is in place. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, so this means double dose of a growth hormone, enhancing the growth rate of the cancer cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. I hypomethylates DNA strands by ihibiting the function of DNA-methyl-transerase. It reduces the growth rate of the cancer, so the evolution of the cancer is much less rapid than without the usage of Decitabine.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because DNA methylation is maintanied during mitosis, and it is only altered significantly dusring sensitive periods, in which the DNA methyllation is cleared and then reestablished, it remains stable during the lifecycle of the cancerous cells. So if a malignous cell divides, the resulting cells will have the same methyllation patterns as the original cell. The sensitive periods, in which DNA methyllation is altered during normal circumstances, are during the creation and evolution of the sperm and the egg, and after the fetus is formed, there are sensitive periods also. For males, the sensitive period is less than 2 months before the conceiving of an offspring. For females, there are basically 2 period, in which alteration of the epigenetic marks should be avoided: the period when the eggs are developed, and during pregnancy. Using drugs that alter epigenetic markers of the DNA might cause severe side-effects in the offspring if used in the sensitive periods.<br /></div>
