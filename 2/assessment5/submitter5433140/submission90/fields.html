    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>

</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer through various mechanisms which include the over expression of growth promoters in the case of disruption at the H19/Igf2 cluster in Wilm's tumour</p><p></p><p>The imprint control region (ICR) for these genes is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the female allele</p><p>On the female allele the unmethylated ICR allows the binding of CTCF which is an insulating protein.  CTCF insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers.  The downstream enhancers are then free to act on H19 so expression of H19 is enhanced on the female allele</p><p>In contrast the ICR is methylated on the male allele.  As a result CTCF cannot bind and the enhancers are able to access Igf2 and hence activate Igf2.   DNA methylation from the ICR  spreads to H19 and thus leads to suppression of H19 expression   </p><p>Wilm's tumour is linked with disruption of normal imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster.  In this condition there is the presence of two paternal like alleles and no maternal like allele.  .</p><p>When both alleles are imprinted in the paternal pattern this leads to upregulation of Igf2 which acts as an oncogene through its growth promotion  </p><p><br /></p><p></p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells the DNA at CpG island is unmethylated whereas the DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is methylated and therefore silenced.  By being unmethylated the CpG islands allow activity of the tumour suppressor gene.</p><p>In cancer cells there is genome wide hypomethylation  but with locus specific hypermethylation at CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes.  By being hypermethylated the CpG island is silenced hence silencing the tumour suppressor gene and facilitating tumorigenesis. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated and hence not silenced.   </p><p>Methylation of the intergenic regions and repeats is important in normal cells to maintain genomic stability. In cancer cells these regions become hypomethylated leading to genomic instability and hence an abnormal karyotype This occurs  via a number of mechanisms such as illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.  This results in changes such deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions. In a normal cell the methylation of intergenic regions and repeats prevents those processes and hence stabilizes the genome</p><p>The overall impact of DNA methylation on tumorigenesis varies with different tumours.  If a particular tumour type is driven by hypermethylation of CpG islands then depleting methylation would  suppress tumour growth Conversely if a tumour is driven by chromosome instability then depleting methylation at intergenic regions would enhance tumour  growth.  These consideration are very important when considering the impact of drugs leading to methylation depletion as the impact could vary depending on the tumour type  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltrasnferasea (DNMT)  inhibitor  ie it is a demethylating agent</p><p>It is a nucleoside analogue which becomes incorporated into DNA during replication.  It then irreversibly binds DNMT  and prevents the methylation of DNA.  It is dependent on replication and whilst there is a lack of specificity inherent in its mechanism of action it will have its greatest impact on cells which are most actively dividing which are generally tumour cells but  may also impact  some normal tissues which rapidly divide such as the cells of the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract and hair follicles.</p><p>By blocking methylation of the hypermethylated CpG islands Decitabine  blocks repression of the  tumour suppressor genes in tumours hence allowing expression of the tumour suppressor gene and thus exerts an anti tumour effect in tumours  where tumour growth is primarily driven by CpG hypermethylation  such as myelodysplastic sydndrome which has progressed to AML</p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark and like other epigenetic marks is mitotically heritable and therefore endures for the life of that particular cell line for the lifespan o the individual</p><p>A sensitive period is a period during which epigenetic marks are  made after the previous epigenetic marks have been cleared. There are two major times this occurs.  Following the epigenetic clearance in the preimplantation phase epigenetic marks are then made after implantation. The time course of this varies between different tissues but all occur in the early embryonic period.  The second period occurs during  primordial germ cell  development which commences mid gestation but is not completed  till years later in the case of oocytes</p><p>Treating pregnant patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation could set up abnormal methylation marks in the foetus which would likely then be permanent for the life of that individual after birth and even the patient's grandchildren due to abnormal methylation of the gametes within the developing foetus.  Given that epigenetic marks in gametes are not completed till years later the use of these agents in young people also poses risks to their future offspring through the impact on their gametes</p><p><br /></p></div>
