    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The DNA methylation is a
method to control gene expression. This control is mediated by
methiltransferases as a response to environmental signals. In a normal cell the
CpGs islands are methylated to decrease the expression of the genes and
non-code regions involved in the regulation of the genes. The CpGs islands
situated upstream the constitutive genes are unmethylated, but methylated for
genes that are not expressed. <br />
When a cell changes the pattern of methylation of the genes which control the
cellular cycle, the genes are methylated and the sequence of the intergenic
region, methylated in a normal cell, is unmethylated. This change produces an abnormal
function in the cellular cycle and, thus, cancer. The intergenic regions there are
methylated in a normal cell; this methylation in repetitive regions and the
non-expression regions is for blocking the separation of DNA and the
possibility of recombination or transposition of the sequence, while the methylation
of these regions involves the repression of the control factors. In a cancer
cell these regions are unmethylated and these events can happen. The methylation
and other epigenetic marks are mitotically hereditable, which provokes the
maintenance in a cellular lineage of these changes in the marks. These marks
change along with age and they are maintained and exclusive of different types
of cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the
case of the H19/lgf2 cluster, the methylation is involved in the expression of
the growth factor H19. This factor is silenced in the paternal allele for the
methylation of the gene and the intergenic region upstream the gene. This
methylation blocks the union of the CTCF factor and provokes the expression of
the lgf2 gene situated upstrean the gene in the paternal allele. In the
maternal allele, the intergenic region is unmethylated and the CTCF factor is
joined to the region, which provokes the expression of the H19 gene. Lgf2 is not
methylated in both alleles, they are regulated by the methylation of the region
previously described. This gene is involved in the regulation of the cell
cycle; in the case of Wilm´s tumor, both alleles are paternal pattern of
methylation, which makes the growth factor not be expressed and the cell not control
its cellular cycle.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
Economist article describes how overmethylation affects the gene expression,
silencing the genes involved in the control of the cell cycle and growth.
Decitabine is an DNA-demethylating agent which minimizes the effects of the overmethylation
implicated in cancer. This drug acts in the methyl group of the hystone
aminoacids and the CpG´s island in the DNA sequences, activating the genes
which were silenced by the overmethylation and returning the cell to a normal
activity. This treatment involves several changes along the cellular lineage.
Erasing the epigenetic marks in a cellular lineage prevents cancer; the
epigenetic marks are hereditable and the cells which are erased may return to
normality with time, due to the chemical signal of the surrounding tissue, but
may be a problem to the gametes and oocyte cells. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>This susceptibility may be caused by the expression
of control cycle genes. These genes recognize the effect of this drug as an abnormal
phase of development and initiate apoptosis. When the genome is undermethylated
the balance of the cell is more susceptible to change. A sensitive period for
treatment is a period when the cell is sensitive to the next chemotherapy treatment. The epigenetic marks are
hereditable, this is the reason why they have enduring effects on the epigenome
and the reason why there is a sensitive period for the next chemotherapy
treatment. This treatment is problematic if it is applied during pregnancy; the
fetus does not develop correctly because of the non-epigenetic marks for the differentiation
of the different tissues, expresses the genoma ramdomly in all the cells and,
consequently, dies. During the fetus’ growth all the cells are in division, in
an adult body the percentage of the cells in division is small, only in cancer
cells this percentage is larger, because cancer is an abnormal growth of the
cells. This is the reason why the chemotherapy target is the control of cell
division and growth factors.</span><p></p></div>
