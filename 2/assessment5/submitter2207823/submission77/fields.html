    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the most well researched epigenetic mark that differs between normal and tumor cells in humans.

In normal cells, CpG Islands preceding gene promoters are generally unmethylated. Other individual CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome tend to be methylated. Consequently CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters allow tumor suppressor genes to express, preventing the development of tumors.

Hypermethylation of gene promoters  silences those genes. This type of epigenetic mutation is dangerous when genes that regulate the cell cycle are silenced, allowing cells to grow and reproduce uncontrollably, leading to tumorigenesis.

In cancer CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters are often hypermethylated. This blocks tumor suppressor gene promoters and silences the expression of tumor suppressor genes, allowing the uncontrolled proliferation of cells: the arise of tumors.

Intergenic intervals and the repetitive elements are regions  usually methylated. The function of methylation in these regions is not silencing the expression of normal genes but to maintain genomic integrity. Without the appropriate methylation at intergenic  there's genomic instability and different mutations can happen:  deletions,  insertions, duplications of whole chromosomes and translocations between chromosomes. Intergenic methylation  also silences splice sites. 

Normal cells  silence by methylation repetitive elements to prevent  mutagenic transposition that can occur. DNA methylation is mutagenic;  this may also prevent transposition because the mutations will mean perhaps that the promoters don't work anymore. Silencing of these repeats will also avoid transcriptional interference. It can also prevent illegitimate recombination. DNA methylation protects the genome from these transposable elements.

In cancer these intergenic intervals and their repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated. As whole, the genome appears hypomethylated:  in we see genomic instability, deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, chromosome duplications and loss of chromosomes. This hypomethylation  occurs at the intergenic intervals.  Repetitive elements  lead to, help to produce genomic instability in cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Chromosome 11p15.5 contains two independently regulated clusters. An imprinting conttrol region, ICR, in each cluster controls monoallelic expression of the surounding genes. The ICRs correspond to secuences that are methylated on one  parental allele: differentially methylated regions DMRs. Opposite methylation defects at the ICR controlling IGF2/H19 lead to the fetal over growth syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann and the growth retardation syndrome Silver-Russell. BWS syndrome is also caused by the  loss of ICR methylation and deregulation in the centromeric  cluster or paternal uniparental disomy which results in  aberrant methylation at the ICRs of both clusters.

In Wilms' tumor we find loss of imprinting of IGF2, H19 and methylation of the H19 promoter. In normal cells, the paternal IGF2 and maternal H19 genes are expressed. Several sites upstream of H19 are methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. In tumors with loss of imprinting, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth. Loss of imprinting of H19 on the maternal chromosome, when it occurs, could occur independently or could be influenced by events in the paternal chromosome.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine  is an epigenetic drug,  a chemical analogue of cytidine, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine,  that  may be used  for treatment myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). It belongs to the group of DNA-demethylating agents 
Cells in the presence of Decitabine incorporate it into DNA during replication and RNA during transcription. The incorporation of Decitabine into DNA or RNA inhibits methyltransferase thereby causing demethylation in that sequence. This adversely affects the way that cell regulatory proteins are able to bind to the DNA/RNA substrate.
Decitabine's anticancer effects are two:  
 First it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. 
Second Decitabine also works as antimetabolite.  When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with several  targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A lot of lymphomas are caused by mutations that make enzyme EZH2, which attaches methyl groups to histones, overactive. Such over activity methylates histones more than they should be and silences near genes including so-called tumor-suppressor genes which stop the uncontrolled cell growth (cancer).

Epigenetic drugs alter the tumor cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. Unlike other forms of gene regulation, epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. It is truly a conceptual breakthrough, and epigenetics might justly take its place alongside genetics in the analysis and treatment of cancer.
We need to consider  patients that have developing germ cells for example in sensitive periods. We should remember about the sensitive period  that one very large insult to the environment would be taking a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery and have consequences for the whole live of the patient and for his offspring. We should avoid these treatmets  in sensitive periods</div>
