    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally DNA is hypomethylated at the CpG island, which means that genes can be expressed, e.g. tumoursupressing genes which are hypomethylated can be expressed normally, in cancer cells this changes, CpG islands become hypermethylated, gaining methylation which causes silencing of those tumoursupressing genes in the previous example. The result here is that the cell will divide more or that the apotosis mechanism in the cell isn't working anymore.<br /><br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is basically the other way around, in normal cells those regions and elements are hypermethylated, which means that those elements/regions are silenced, which mostly means a lower expression of those elements. This is necessary for genome stability, but in cancer cells those regions and elements are becoming hypomethylated, which causes those elements to be expressed, and can increase genome instability</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele has a methylated ICR, when this is the case, the CTCF (insulator protein) can not bind to it and this causes the enhancers to express igf2.<br /><br />In the maternal allele there is hypomethylation of the ICR which causes the CTCF to bind to it and in return causes the enhancers to enhance the H19 long non-coding RNA (and not igf2!)<br /> <br />In Wilm's tumour, we have hypermethylation of  ICR (imprinting control regions) on the maternal allele which causes an Igf2 overexpression. <br /><br />Igf2 is an oncogene (growth promoting gene), which causes the cell to divide more and in this way contributes to cancer.<br /><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating / hypomethylating agent, a DMNT inhibitor. It is used to remove DNA methylation. <br /></span><span>This means that it can allow previously silenced tumour supressor genes to be expressed again. When those are expressed, the cell cycle could be normalized again (in the best case dividing / apoptosis of the cell returns return to normal)<br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the daughter and granddaughter cells will have the same methylation. This is because the DMNT (DNA methyltransferase) make sure that the correct methylation is added during DNA replication.<br /><br />It would be inadvisable to give those kind of drugs during embryonic and germ cell development, those are the most sensitive periods for the epigenome. During those periods, methylation markers are cleared and being reprogrammed.<br /><br />When we would give patients DNA methylation altering drugs during those periods, the results could be very unpredictable. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
