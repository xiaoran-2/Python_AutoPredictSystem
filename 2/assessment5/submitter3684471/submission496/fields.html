    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">It is supposed that DNA methylation at CpG islands normally inhibits gene expression, since CpGs occur usually in the promoter of a gene. In cancer we observe hypermethylation at many CpG islands, which decreases dramatically expression of some genes, for example those coding for tumour suppressors - the result of such an action is quite obvious.

Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in order to maintain genomic integrity, for example to prevent transcriptional interference and, in case of repetitive elements, also to avoid transposition or illegitimate recombination. In cancer we observe hypomethylation at both intergenic regions and repetitive elements. It produces genomic instability, one of the hallmarks of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In paternal cluster the CTCF region is methylated and the methylation spreads to the promoter of H19 gene. The H19 isn't thus expressed and it enables the enhancers (located downstream) to activate Igf2 gene. In paternal allele neither the CTCF region, nor the promoter of H19 are methylated, so the enhancers cannot activate Igf2 and the gene remains silenced.

In Wilm's tumour both the paternal and maternal alleles are methylated and consequently Igf2 is overexpressed. The product of the expression of that gene is a growth factor, so its excess disrupts the growth of the cell and may contribute to the cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating (hypomethylating) agents. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase and causes hypomethylation of DNA. It's been shown that this medicine reactivate epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor genes in in vitro experiments (Stressman, Lyko 2008).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation or other epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, so they can be passed into and endured in the next generations of the cancer cells. Sensitive period is a period of development when our cells are especially vulnerable to the epigenetic remodelling. There are two sensitive periods in humans: in early development and in primordial germ cell development. It is not advisable to treat preadolescent patients with epigenetic drugs, because their primordial germ cells are still developing.</div>
