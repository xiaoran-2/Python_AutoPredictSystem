    <div class="field-value">Normally GpG islands are kept free of methylation independent of corresponding genes activity state. However in cancer cells these CGIs are often found to be <span>hypermethylated. The effect of this promoters CGI hypermethylation is gene silencing. Silencing tumor suppressor genes seems to be very strong "hit" in terms of Knudson hypothesis.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repeats tend to be methylated in healthy cells. This methylation works for stabilization of genome, preventing aberrant recombinations from happening. In most tumor types these regions are usually losing their methylation and that results in </span>reciprocal translocations between chromosomes, insertions and deletions. These aberrations are disrupting functions of neighboring genes and may both increase or decrease expression.<br />One other way for hypomethylation of intergenic regions can play it's role is misexpression of long non-coding RNAs such as HOTAIR  (HOX<span> antisense <strong>intergenic</strong></span><span> RNA)</span>. There're evidences that HOTAIR is overexpressed in breast cancer and probably other tumor types. Exact role of lnciRNA in tumors is still unclear.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted. Paternal ICR is methylated (methylation also spreads into neighboring H19 region, effectively silencing it) and maternal ICR is unmethylated. Unmethylated maternal ICR binds CTCF insulator protein which prevents enhancers of H19/Igf2 cluster to act on Igf2 gene and instead resulting in expression of H19 RNA. Methylated paternal ICR can't bind CTCF and so cluster's enhancers can act on preferred chromatin loop targeting Igf2 and causing it's expression.<br />Cell's of Wilm's tumor shows hypermethylation of H19/Igf2 cluster resulting in methylation marks established on both paternal and maternal alleles. This leads to growth promoter Igf2 over expression and contributes to fast cancer cells division.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine inhibits DNMT enzymes. It binds DNMT before it can act on DNA itself. This results in <b>passive</b> demethylation of DNA through cells division. New replicas of cells effected by </span><span>Decitabine will have less methylation marks on DNA.<br /></span>Full range of <span>Decitabine's effects on cancer cells is still unclear, but positive clinical results can by explained by the fact that many tumor types are dependent on tumor suppression genes hypermethylation and passive demethylation helps to slow down tumor growth.Long lasting effects of such non-specific DNA demethylation are also unclear but this question is less of importance compared to patient's survival.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is very stable in a sense that it replicates itself through mitosis. This is achieved through actions of DNMT enzymes family which are replicating methylation marks on new cells. Because of this any changes in methylation pattern of cell's DNA will last in all descendants of this cell.<br />Cancer as condition is more frequent in elderly patients, so long-lasting effects of changed DNA methylation are less important compared to survival. However treating patients with epigenome-affecting drugs during sensitive periods is risky. By definition sensitive period is time while altered environment can have influence on epigenetic control. In human it happens during embryo development from fertilization till epiblast stage and also during germ cells development. Drugs altering DNA methylation is <strong>huge</strong> environmental stress, so it can be expected that women taking such drugs during pregnancy will have child with abnormal epigenetic marks. This can even effect grand-childs because females are developing germ cells for lifetime during prenatal period. Sensitive period risk also applies to males because they are developing sperm germ cells for most of their life.</div>
