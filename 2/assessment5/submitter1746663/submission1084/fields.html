    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is one of the important epigenetic mechanisms which is involved in X chromosome inactivation, imprinting etc. and is highly dysregulated in cancer. In DNA methylation is cytosine base is modified (5mC) at mainly CpG  and is found in approximately 70-80% CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells and to some extent in non-CpG sequences (Hassler et al., 2012). CpG islands, are called so as they have a high CpG density. Methylation of promoters in general corresponds to low level of gene expression with exception being the CpG islands which are ususally kept free of methylation independent of their activity state (Hassler et al., 2012). In normal cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated while the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hypermethylated and this keeps the transposable elements present in intergenic region silent and helps in maintaining genomic stability. However in cancer cells, there is reversal of this state and the CpG islands of  mostly tumor suppressor genes becomes hypermethylated while the intergenic region and repetitive elements become hypomethylated. So, in cancer there is locus specific hypermethylation and genome wide hypomethyaltion. Hypomethylation leads to opening of chromatin and activation of the transposons which are normally located in the intergenic region and opening of chromatin  also facilitates illegimate recombination of repeats and reciprocal translocation. Hypomethylation can also leads to activation of cryptic promotes and disruption of neighboring genes; for example in Agouti vaiable yellow gene, repeats are present upstream of the genes and their activation led to aberrant expression of gene . Thus, genome wide hypomethylation leads to activation of repeats and transposition, illegetimate recombination between repeats and thereby increased genomic instability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, ICR is present in after the Igf2 and before H19 . ICR is methylated on paternal allele and thereby imprinted on paternal allele but is unmethylated on maternal allele. Since ICR is unmethylated on maternal allele, it is bound by insulator protein CTCF which restricts enhancers to act on Igf2 and hence Igf2 is not expressed but H19 is expressed. In paternal allele, since the ICR is methylated, CTCF cannot bind and therefore, enhancer are free to bind to the Igf2 and thereby lead to its expression. H19 is not expressed is due to heterochromatin spreading from the methylated ICR. Cancer is associated with dysregulation of methylation and one of he common features of cancer is loss of imprinting and thereby  leading to expression or silencing of genes from both alleles, so it could be either hypo or hypermethylation at ICR and this can result in loss of tumour suppressors or activation of growth promoting oncogenes. In  Wilm's tumor,  is   maternal ICR is also hypermethylated , therefore, Igf2 is expressed from both alleles and there is double dose of this protein. Igf2 is growth promoting and so associated with  Wilm's tumor.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There are many types of enzymatic epigenetic regulators that are being used as drug targets including DNMTi (DNMT inhibitors),HDACi etc. Decitabine belong to the DNMTi class. DNMTi are nucleoside analogues and they get incorporated into the DNA during replication. So, when the DNMTs come and bind at these places, then it gets irreversibly bound to them and their effect is replication dependent, So, the rapidly dividing cancer cells are affected. These DNMTi have antineoplastic or anti tumor effect as they bring about hypomethylation of tumor suppressor genes. Therefore, Decitabine, which is a DNMTi gets incorporated in the DNA and brings about hypomethylation of CpG islands by inhibiting DNMTs. Since Decitabine is a DNMTi and hypomethylates the CpG, it may bring about expression of the silenced tumor suppressor genes which can restrict cancer growth and thus <span>Decitabine can exert anti-tumor effect in this way.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">One of the main features of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic stability. DNA methylation works in collaboration with the other epigenetic marks like histone methylation, acetylation etc. Altering the DNA methylation can lead to hypo or hypermethylation. Hypomethylation can activate genes, repeats which can result in illegitimate recombination, translocation, overamplification or silencing of genes.<br />Sensitive period is the period when germ cells developing in a person as well as the phases when epigenetic reprogramming is happening ( i.e during the primordial germ cell development and during early embryonic development).Treating patients, especially the younger people during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because these drugs would affect all cells of the body and it may affect the germ cells in a n unpredictable way and these effects could be carried down to the next generation. Since, the methylation marks are being laid down in this period, it may be perturbed and these epimutatons can be carried over to the next generation.</div>
