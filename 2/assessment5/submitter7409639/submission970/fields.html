    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Well the function of DNA methylation at Cpg islands is silencing that particular gene and reduce or prevent its transcription. In cancer, DNA methylation at CpG islands of tumor suppressor gene will increased as known as hypermethylation and lead to inactivation of these tumor suppressor genes. Where as in oncogene DNA methylation at CpG islands would be decreased as known as hypomethylation and lead to activation of oncogenes. DNA hypermethylation at CpG of suppressor gene and hypomethylation a CpG of oncogenes will lead to increase of proliferation and growing of cancers cells. However, intergenic regions and repetitive elements normally are hpermethylated, where as in cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypo or unmethylated. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Well ICRs are important in control of expression of restricting genes and  promoting genes. Hypermethylation of ICRs will lead to inactivation of expression of restricting genes and activation of expression of promoting genes. In paternal allele ICR is methylated, so enhancers will be able to express Igf2. where as in maternal allele ICR is unmethylated so the enhancers will express H19 and Igf2 will be silence. In Wilm's tumor, ICR of maternal allele will be methylated in addition to ICR of paternal allele that will express maternal Igf2 cluster as well as paternal Igf2 cluster, so there will be duble expressed of Igf2 cluster which know as promoting genes that lead to cancer. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Well Decitabine is belonged to hypomethylating agents, it inhibits DNA methyltransferase enzyme that lead to prevent the DNA methylation. it has anti-tumor effect because it will prevent the methylation of tumor suppressor genes and let the cancer cells die.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Well since epigenetic changes are convied  to daughter and granddaughter cells during during cell division until they are erased, so the effects of drugs that alter DNA methylation will last as long as epigentic changes are not actively erased. Sensitive period is in where primordial germ cells are still developing during  early development. <br /></div>
