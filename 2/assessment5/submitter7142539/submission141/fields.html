    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, we can find hypermethylation and hypomethylation.This depends on the region we are looking at. For example, if we look at the tumour supressor genes CpG islands, these will be hypomethylated, but in contrast, if we look at repetitive elements and intergenomic regions, these will be hypermethylated. This is needed for a normal growth of the cell. However, if we alter this methylation pattern, we can get a cell which divides itself quickly, in other words, we can get a tumour. Then, we find two things  related with methylation in a cancer cell. First of these things is an hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumour supressor genes, which will result in silencing of these genes, and this will lead to an uncontrolled growth of the cell. On the other hand, we find hypomethylation of the repetitive elements and intergenomic regions in a cancer cell. This is a big problem because there will be genomic instability. The genomic instability is due to these repetitive elements and intergenomic regions that are hypomethylated, and therefore, they will be active. The activation of these regions can produce illegitime recombinations that can cause reciprocal translocations, deletions and insertions, and also may cause the jump to other places in the genome and modifying the pattern of expression of other genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster is imprinted. There are differences in the pattern of methylation of the imprinted control (ICR) regions depending on if we are looking at the maternal or paternal allele. On the maternal allele, there is not methylation at the ICR. Then CTCF protein binds to ICR and insulates Igf2 from the enhancers. So, enhancers act in H19 promoters enhancing their expression, but Igf2 is not expressed. However, on the paternal allele is different. Here, there is methylation at the ICR and CTCF protein does not bind to  ICR. There is not expression of H19, but enhancers act on Igf2 promoting its expression. What we find in Wilm's tumour is an hypermethylation of maternal allele imprinted control region. This will lead to the expression of Igf2 (which, in a normal siituation, is not expressed from the maternal allele). Then, we will have overexpression of Igf2 gene, which is an oncogen, a growth promoter. Therefore, this can contibutes to cancer, because we will have an uncontrolled growth of the cell.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylation agent. It is used to treat myelodisplastic syndromes, because it acts hypomethylating DNA. <br />This drug is useful to treat cancer because, as we have learnt in the last weeks, in a cancer cell there are an hypermethylation of tumour supressor genes promoters. This lead to the silencing of these genes and, therefore, the uncontrolled growth of the cell. For this reason, decitabine has an anti- tumour effect, allowing the expression of tumour supressor genes due to hypomethylation of their promoters.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark. Epigenetic marks are established in some developmental moments and then they are maintained for all the life of the cell. These moments are during preimplatation period and during primordial germ cell development, and these are considered sensitive period, because demethylation occurs and then there will be methylation again.<br />If we treat patients during sensitive periods, it is possible that we do not solve the problem, because in a sensitive period there is a reseting of epigenetic marks. This is why treating a patient during a sensitive period would be inadvisable.<br />However, if we alter DNA methylation pattern of a somatic cell in a different moment from sensitive periods, this will have an enduring effect on epigenome, because there is not more period of reset the epigenomic marks and DNA methylation is heritable, passes on to subsequent cell generations</div>
