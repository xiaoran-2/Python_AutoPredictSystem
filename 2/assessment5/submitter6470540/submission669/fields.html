    <h1>Submission 669 from Anon (session_user_id: 292a312d740056d18d08ad2e274020b4a38901fd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA demethylating agents. Being cytosine analogue the Decitabine can incorporate into DNA strand and covalently bind to DNA methyltransferase. This is irreversible complex, no further methylation can occur. So DNMT inhibition causes DNA hypomethylation and may reactivate previously silenced tumor suppressor genes and by this way to stop cancer cell division. Decitabine is FDA approved drug for therapy of myelodystplastic syndrome. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that  mitotically or meiotically heritable and provide the way of passing altered gene expression pattern through cell generation. The epigenetic drugs help to reset normal DNA methylation pattern. As a results, decrease DNA methylation at promoter regions and reactivation of tumor suppressor genes can be mitotically inherited, altered methylation pattern will be erased and cancer development will be stopped.  <br />Inspite of epigenome is responsive to environment throughout lifespan, the time of epigenetic reprogramming of genome, when epigenetic marks clear and de novo methylation lay down, refers to most sensitive period. First massive drop in methylation happens just after fertilization and goes on with different rate and by different way for maternal and paternal genome. De novo methylation restores by the period of implantation. Next erasure of epigenetic marks occurs during primordial germ cell development. But sensitivity of gametogenesis may last until full oocytes and sperm maturation (prepubertal and pubertal period). So the changes in epigenomic profile under epigenetic drugs with all its side-effects may be passed on to the next generation. So these periods of life (and pregnancy, of course) are inadvisable for treating by epigenetic drugs.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is crucial mechanism for regulation of monoallelic gene expression of parent-of-origin genes. Disruption of this process may be involved in cancer development as it happens with H19/Igf2 cluster. Both genes are expressed on chromosome 11. H19 is a gene for non-coding RNA, Igf2 is gene for insulin growth factor  that is strong cell growth promoter. Region of DNA between these genes is known as Imprint control region (ICR).  Paternal ICR  is  methylated that make H19 silent and enable Igf2 expression by allowing of Igf2 promoters  to contact with the enhancers downstream of H19 gene. Maternal ICR is not methylated and served as site for binding CTCF insulator. CTCF insulator isolate IGf2 gene from enhancers and by this way block its expression. So in normal cells paternal Igf2 and maternal H19 are expressed. When maternal ICR is methylated on paternal manner we got hyperexpression of Igf2 gene and lack of H19 gene expression. This type of expression is observed in Wilm's tumor.  At any case biallelic expression of Igf2 gene due to disrupting methylation pattern at the H19/Igf2 cluster has a strong oncogenic effect because IGF cell growth promotion. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is chemical process of covalent binding methyl group to cytosine in C5 position, preferably happens on CpG sites. High density clusters of CpG sites form CpG islands and usually located in promoter region of housekeeping genes. DNA methylation at CpG islands in promoter region locks genes in silent status. In normal cells the most part of promoter regions is free of methylation. In cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated and tumor suppressor genes become inactive and  allow cell to growth unlimitedly. <br />DNA methylation also observed  in intragenic region and repetitive region. Repetitive elements make up more than half of human genome and in normal cells these region are frequently hypermethylated to prevent their excessive activity (transposition, re-activation of cryptic promoters etc) and possible  genome instability.  In cancer cells intragenic regions and repetitive elements show hypomethylated status. Hypomethilation of repeats and intragenic regions leads to aberrant gene expression, unwilling recombination between repeats, translocation and insertional mutagenesis etc. by this way contribute to cancer development and progress.<br />So, DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppress genes and global DNA hypomethylation are the hallmark of cancer. </div>
