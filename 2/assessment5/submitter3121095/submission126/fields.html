    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">1 silencing of gene expression<br />2 Hypermethylation at CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes<br />3 cause loss of expression of tumor suppressor by silencing them<br />4 silence repetitive elements<br />5 DNA hypomethylation of repetitive elements and  intergenic regions<br /> 6 lead to Genomic Instability(result Illegitimate recombination between repeats,Activation of repeats and transposition, Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1 on  paternal allele  methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF <br />and
methylation
 extended to promoter of h19 gene thus silence  h19 and allow enhancer to access Igf2(upregulate it's expression)<br />2 on maternal allele 
 ICR and h19 is unmethylated  thus allow CTCF bing which insulate Igf2 from interaction with downstream enhancer but allow enhancer bind h19<br />3 
over expression
 of Igf2  and lose of  cdnk1c by Mutation/ deletion or Uniparental disomy or Epigenetic disruption<br />4 over expression of Igf2 promote growth and lose of cdnk1c which inhibit growth</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1 DNA-demethylating agents<br />2 Nuceloside analogues, irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA<br />3 reduce DNA methylation in a cell division dependent manner cancer cell replicate more than normal cell which enhance it's 
methylation reduction capacity</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1 epigenetic marks are metastable which mean they are mitotic inheritable<br />2 period of large scale epigenetic reprogramming <br />3 1)preimplantation  and early post implantation   2)primordial germ cell development<br />4 during this period of massive epigenetic reporgramming an environment insult like an epigenetic agent is likely to disrupt it's epigenetic  machinery and have downstream consequence(ex effects on germ cells)<br /><br /></div>
