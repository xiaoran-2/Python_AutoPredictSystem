    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, CpG islands can be found in a a hypomethylated state, while it's surrounding intergenic region and repetitive element are hypermethylated. In a cancerous cell however these hyper/hypomethylated states are exchanged. The CpG islands then become hypermethylated and it's intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated. This change causes the strong promoter at CpG island to be silenced, hence silencing the genes associated to it (tumor suppressor genes). Meanwhile the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become active which cause genome instability by allowing these regions to either jump around chromosomes causing translocations and therefore disrupting other genes (oncogenes), and deletions and insertions of chromosomes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell the paternal allele is hypermethylated at it's ICR. This allows the enhancers to work on Igf2 and H19 to be silenced. The maternal allele however is hypomethylated at it's ICR allowing CTCF to bind to the ICR blocking the expression of Igf2 and allowing instead the enhancers to work on H19 to be expressed. In Wilm's tumor however this natural imprinting in disrupted and so the maternal allele becomes hypermethylated making it behave the same as the paternal allele. Therefore we have an overexpression of Igf2, a growth promotor. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used in treating myelodysplastic syndromes that have progressed to AML. It acts by going into the nucleus, incorporating itself into the DNA and irreversibly binding to the DNMTs therefore inhibiting its action and lowering the methylation progressively each time the cell divides. Since cancer cells are replicating much more quickly than normal cells it would have a much higher impact on the cancerous cells than the normal ones. Because these myelodysplastic syndromes are dependant on hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, lowering the methylation will eventually allow these genes to become active again. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetics by definition states that these marks have to be inherited mitotically through it's daughter cells for them to be considered epigenetic marks. Therefore when epigenetic drugs are used, the changes these drugs cause on the epigenome, and consequently on the gene expression, will be passed down through the daughter cells making it a permanent change. <br /><br />Because these changes can be permanent there are certain times in which these changes in the epigenome can have deleterious effects. These sensitive periods occur during the pre-implantation stage of the embryo and during the development of the primordial germ cells. There are certain epigenetic marks and conditions that must be met for the embryo to survive. If the drugs are administered during these sensitive periods it would negatively affect the growth of embryo which could lead to it's loss.</div>
