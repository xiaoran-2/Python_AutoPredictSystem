    <div class="field-value"><div><ol><li><span>About 55% of the human genome consists of repetitive elements , among which
LINE-1 and Alu are the most plentiful families representing approximately 30%
of the human genome. Because of their high representation throughout the
genome, LINE-1 and Alu have been used as global surrogate markers for
estimating the genomic DNA methylation level . DNA methylation patterns are
largely established in utero or during early life and stably maintained during
later development, but can be changed in response to endogenous and exogenous exposure factorsMany cellular pathways are
inactivated by this type of
epigenetic lesion: DNA repair (hMLH1, MGMT), cell cycle (p16(INK4a),
p15(INK4b), p14(ARF)), apoptosis (DAPK), cell adherence (CDH1, CDH13),
detoxification (GSTP1), etc em leader However, we still know little of the
mechanisms of aberrant methylation and why certain genes are selected over
others. Hypermethylation is not an isolated layer of epigenetic control, but is
linked to the other pieces of the puzzle such as methyl-binding

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><div>Hyper- and hypomethylation at the IGF2-H19 imprinting
control region (ICR) result in reciprocal changes in IGF2-H19 expression and
the two contrasting growth disorders, Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and
Silver–Russell syndrome (SRS). DNA methylation of the ICR controls the
reciprocal imprinting of IGF2 and H19 by preventing the binding of the
insulator protein, CTCF. We here show that local changes in histone modiﬁcationsand CTCF–cohesin binding at the ICR in BWS and
SRS together with DNA methylation correlate with the higherorder chromatin
structure at the locus. Ι<span>n BWS and SRS cells, there is
opposing <span>chromatin looping conformation mediated
by CTCF–cohesin binding sites surrounding the locusOverexpression of
insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), an imprinted gene located on chromosome
11p15, has been reported as a characteristic feature in various embryonal
tumors, including Wilms tumor (WT). Recent studies specified loss of imprinting
(LOI) in a differential methylated region (DMR) of the IGF2/H19 cluster or loss
of heterozygosity (LOH), respectively, uniparental disomy (UPD) being
responsible for this overex</span></span>pression. However, the role of other imprinted genes in the genesis of WT is still unknown.<br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value"><span> They found that the amount of histone overmethylation declined dramatically.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

    <div class="field-value"><span>Histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. This result was notable for two reasons. It was the first time epigenetic drugs had been deployed successfully against a solid tumour, rather than a leukaemia or a lymphoma (solid tumours are harder to treat, because the drug has to penetrate them). And, second, some of the participants in Dr Baylin's study who did not show much response to the trial itself then went on to show an unexpectedly good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them next. Although it is too early to say for sure, Dr Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</span></div>
