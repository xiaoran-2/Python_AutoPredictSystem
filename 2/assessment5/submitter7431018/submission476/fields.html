    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">At
CpG islands, DNA are hypomethylated, which activates the transcription of the
gene. However, in cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated, which then
cause silencing of the underlying gene. In this case, the tumor suppressor
genes are silenced, causing the tumor to grow. In the intergenic regions and
repetitive elements of normal cells, DNA are hypermethylated, which stabilizes
the genome. In cancer, however, these regions are hypomethylated, leading to
genomic instability, such as deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations
of the chromatin.<br /><span>References:

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In
paternal allele, DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding. Without
CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can
access Igf2 to activate it. In maternal allele, CTCF acts as insulator protein,
which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Igf2 therefore is not
expressed. The majority of Wilm’s tumors show a bipaternal
epigenotype at these loci(by selective loss of maternal and reduplication of
paternal chromosome), with H19 inactive and IGF2 biallelically active.
Increased expression of the IGF2 gene is responsible for somatic overgrowth in
the Beck-Wiedemann syndrome and predisposition to tumors.<br />References: lecture slides; Role of genomic imprinting in Wilms' tumour and overgrowth disorders. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Reeve%20AE%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=8827076">Reeve AE</a>.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine
is <span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methyltransferase">DNA
methyltransferase</a> inhibitor. By irreversibly binding to DNA methyltransferase
during DNA replication, it inhibits DNA methylation. In </span>tumorigenesis,
tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated, suppressing their transcription.
While DNA methyltransferase methylates DNA, it plays a role in it. Therefore,
by inhibiting DNA methylatransferase, Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect.<br /><span>References:

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA
methylation can cause alteration of epigenetic modifiers, and then alter
epigenetic states. Sensitive period is the time that epigenetic marks are being
actively remodeling (erased and rebuilt). During development, the epigenetic
reprogramming are active in early development and in primordial germ cell
development. These two phases are sensitive periods. After the sensitive
periods, the epigenetic states are established, and it can be passed on during
each cell division. Treating patients during sensitive periods (i.e. before the
epigenetic marks being established), however, can alter the epigenetic states
of the normal cells, which can cause genomic instability and result in serious
outcome. Therefore, we should avoid treating patients during sensitive periods.<br /><span>References:
