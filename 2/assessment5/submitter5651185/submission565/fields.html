    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands
is to silence tumour suppressor genes. The DNA methylation of these CpG
islands is disrupted in cancer by becoming denser or more methylated, not
silencing the tumour suppressor genes. This disruption of DNA methylation at
CpG islands is mitotically heritable, being a very good locking down mechanism
in terms of epigenetic silencing CpG island hypomethylation occurs really frequently
in tumors because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, being a very efficient
way to silence tumour suppressor genes. These epimutations are rapidly
selected, by increasing the capacity of cells with CpG island hypomethylation
to divide or reducing cell death. DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to
cancer diagnosis, prognosis and to inform about the treatment.</p><p>

</p><p><span>The
normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive
elements is to maintain genomic stability. In cancer, these elements are
hypomethylated, so illegitimate recombination between repeats occurs, repeats
and transpositions are activated and cryptic promoters are activated and also
disruption to neighboring genes. The disruption of DNA methylation in
intergenic regions and repetitive elements contribute to cancer by the
chromosomal instability, enhancing tumorigenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA Methyl-trasnferases inhibitor (DNMTi), so it is a DNA-demethylating agent. ISold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, it is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes,  precursors of the acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine inhibits DNA methyl-transferases, therefore, every time a cell divides  methylation marks cannot be established, so new cells will have demethylated DNA.<br /><br />Drugs like Decitabine  are capable of reverse the hypermethylation of CpG islands that are typical in cancer. Tumor suppressor genes are silenced by this mitotically heritable hypermethylations . Low doses of this drug can remove these methyl groups, allowing tumor suppressors to act against tumor cells causing few side effects.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, that means that epigenetic changes are transmitted from a cell to the daughter. If these changes are erased, they will not be established again. So,  if DNA methylation is erased when treating a tumor, even when the treatment has ended, the methylations will not established again. Therefore, altering DNA methylation may have enduring effects on the epigenome.<br /><br />In epigenetics the sensitive period refers to the period in which the epigenetic marks are removed and established <em>de novo</em>.<br />In humans there are two sensitive periods, the first during early embryonic development and the second during germ cell development.<br /><br />Treating young patients could be dangerous because at that age they are developing their germ cells, a sensitive period where epigenetic marks are being established. If we remove or alter these epigenetic marks in order to treat  cancer the future descendants of the patients could have problems due to the changes caused..<br /><span>That complication  is also aplicable to a pregnant woman, which is even worse as it will directly affect the developing of the embryo.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><p>The H19/Igf2 appears methylated on the paternal allele and
unmethylated in the maternal allele. <span><br />
When
the cluster is unmethylated (maternal allele) the enhancers act on H19 and no
Igf2 expression is seen. In the case of the paternal allele, the enhancer work
over Igf2  so it is expressed.<br />With
loss of imprinting - the imprinting control region is hipermethylated - Igf2 is
expressed in both alleles, the paternal and the maternal one, having a double
dose of Igf2. This Igf2 is associated with Wilm's tumour, a child kidney tumour.</span></p></div><br /></div>
