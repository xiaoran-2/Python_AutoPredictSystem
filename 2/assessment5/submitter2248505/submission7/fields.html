    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:

    <div class="field-value"><b>Q3: DECITABINE.<br /></b><br />Decitabine is an anti-metabolic and  hypomethylating agent that acts by inhibiting the enzyme, DNA methytransferase. It is a chemical analogue of cytidine, a nucleoside present in DNA and RNA. It is approved for the treatment of  myelodysplastic syndromes in the US and also for the treatment of acute myeloid leukamia in Europe..  <br /><br />Cells convert  decitabine to decitabine triphosphate which is incorporated  into DNA during replication. This leads to inhibition of DNA methyltransferase causing hypomethylation of DNA  . This adversely affects the way cell regulatory proteins bind to the DNA or RNA substrates. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to epigenetically silenced genes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation. Decitabine  incorporated into the DNA forms covalent bonds with DNA methyltransferase in rapidly dividing cells leading to cell death. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. Decitabine is cell cycle specific and acts in the S phase of cell cycle.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-value"><b>Q-1.</b><br />Epigenetic changes such as, DNA methylation, play important role in gene expression. DNA methylation, results from addition of methyl group to cytosine bases ("C") to form methylcystosine. This makes the DNA molecule in that region less likely to be expressed. The methylation of the cytosine bases occurs almost exclusively at sites where a cystosine base preceeds a guanine base ("G") to form the CpG site. DNA methylation is a stable heritable epigenetic mark.The methylation of CpG dinucleotides play a key role in X-chromosome inactivation, imprinting of genes and silencing of foreign DNA elements. CpGs are clustered at CpG islands. These islands usually occur upsteam in mammalian genes and are often at the promoter regions of a gene. Hypermethylation of the CpG islands turn off the gene and prevents its expression.  In other words, methylation in promoter regions leads to gene silencing. In normal mammalian cells, however, CpG islands are hypomethylated, while the intergeneic regions, introns and repetitive elements are hypermethylated.<br /><br />Aberrations of DNA methylation occur in many human cancers including lung, colon, prostate and breast cancers. Two types of abnormal DNA methylation have been observed in human cancers: genome-wide hypomethylation and hypermethylation at specific sites of the genome usually the CpG islands. Genome-wide hypomethylation at the intragenic  and intergenic regions, cause genome instability in cancer cells by activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressors genes. Hypermethylation of the CpG islands may also cause silencing of tumor suppressor genes leading to  rapid proliferation of cancer cells.<br /><br />In summary, with normal mammalian cells, CpG islands are usually hypomethylated while the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are heavily methylated. DNA methylation at introns and intergenic regions  help maintain genomic intergrity and stability by silencing of repeats,  preventing illegitimate recombination and avoiding transcriptional interference from strong promoters. This normal pattern is reversed in cancer cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>Q-2.</b><br />Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process, by which several genes can be expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. With imprinting, one of the two parental alleles is epigenetically silenced.  Two of such genes: IGF2 and H19, are reciprocally imprinted, such that IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele and H19 is expressed only from maternal alleles.<br /><br />Two regulatory regions account for their parental allele specific expression: a deferentially methylated region upstream of H19  and a set of tissue specific enhancers down stream of H19. CTCF is an insulator protein that insulates IGF2 from down stream enhancers and enables H19-DMR to regulate the imprinting of both H19 and IGF2. <br /><br />Loss of imprinting (LOI) of IGF2  is linked to reduced expression of H19 in Wilms tumor. The LOI is associated with abnormal methylations in the IGF/H19 locus on chromosome 11. This causes the maternal chromosome to express a paternal pattern of methylation of H19 promoter. IGF2 is turned on and H19 is turned off causing increased cell growth.<br /><br />IGF2 is a potent growth factor and an anti-apoptotic factor. LOI of H19/IGF2, by abnormal methylation of maternal H19-ICR, leads to double dose of IGF2 and contributes to tumorigenesis. Many tumors, including lung and breast cancers, have LOI of IGF2 gene.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>Q-4.</b><br /><br />DNA methylation is epigenetic modification that may be caused by many environmental agents including drugs and hormones. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation  or histone modification are passed on during cell division to daughters cells and the changes persist until they are actively erased. Epigentic changes, in particular DNA methylation, are heritable from a progenitor cell to its progeny cells through mitosis and from a progenitor organism to progeny organism via meiosis. The age at which an organism is exposed to epigentic causing substances or behaviors is a critical factor affecting the consequences of such exposure. <br /><br />Altering DNA methylation is a target in cancer chemotherapy because the epigenetic marks induced by such treatment are long lasting as they are maintained during mitosis by enzyme, DNA methyltransferase.<br /><br />Sensitive period is defined as a period of  epigenetic reprogramming or the clearing of epigenetic marks.  Two waves of reprogramming occur during pre-implantation period/early development and during primordial germ cell development. Furthermore,  exposure of fetuses, newborn infants and young children to epigenetic causing agents may result in serious epigenetic disorders.<br /><br />It is inadvisable to prescribe treatments  that affect epigenetic marks  to pregnant patients or to women of child bearing age as significant reprogramming  occurs in the fetal gametes, infants, children and young adults. </div>
