    <h1>Submission 995 from Anon (session_user_id: 3177c70cf6fbe5af1e13ad51227bde1f62fa0ac9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyl transferase inhibitors and is currently used to treat myelodysplatic syndromes.  This drug could affect tumors by de-methylating hypermethylated tumor suppressor genes.  It could also act on histone tails that are normally hypomethylated.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">it is possible that the epigenetic marks altered with the combination of drugs in Dr. Baylin's study are passed on during cell division to multiple generations until they are actively erased.  A sensitive period for epigenetics is when marks are being cleared and reset - such as during germ cell development and during embryogenesis.  This is why treating younger patients is inadvisable.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands normally function as promoters of tumor suppressor genes.  Methylation of these CpG islands can cause silencing of tumor suppressor genes that can control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair.  DNA methylation seems to also correlate with tumor progression.  Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally silenced with methylation in order to maintain genomic stability.  When these regions become hypomethlyated it leads to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters, and also insertions and deletions to DNA sequence.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR of the paternal allele is methlyated.  This methylation spreads to and silences the H19 promoter which in turn allows downstream enhancers to access and activate Igf2.  Binding of CTCF (an insulator protein) to the ICR of the maternal allele leaves H19 unmethylated and accessible for activation by downstream enhancers.  Loss of imprinting on the maternal allele results in hypermethylation of ICR and over expression of Igf2, leading to Wim's tumor.  Because Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, over expression of this gene can contribute to cancer growth.</div>
