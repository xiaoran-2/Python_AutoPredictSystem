    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is context dependent and also has different patterns depending on the cancer type, so we can say methylation is cancer specific.In general terms DNA methylation in cancer cell  is find in the opposite situation respecting to the normal cell : in the case of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which If they were methylated in a normal cell in order to provide genome stability, we find them hypomethylated in cancer cell to provoque inestability. Also hypomethylation/ hypermethylation will be switched into the contrary function in order to activate those genes who had to be silenced ( oncogenes), or to silence those genes which should be activated ( tumor supressor genes).<br /><ul><li>DNA methylation at CpG islands is a mechanism to silence gene expression because these regions used to be at promoters of the genes.</li><li>In cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated.</li><li>When hypermethylation of Cpg island targets tumor supressor genes, these are no longer expressed and initiate cancer development. This is mitotically heritable so that the numer of cells with tumor supressor gene silenced increases with time.</li><li>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated, in order to mantain genomic integrity preventing delection, insertions, duplications, reciprocal translocations, ilegitimate recombination... etc.</li><li> In cancer, opposite occurs, these regions are hypomethylated so that there is genome inestability.</li><li>Hypomethylation in intergenic regions produces deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions. Also hypomethylation of repetitive elements, such as CpG islands makes them to be poor promoters so that are gene activator regions.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting is associated with methylation, and this proccess is controlled by ICR, so that this permits the monoallelic expression of one gene, that can be paternal or maternal. In cancer cells this pattern is no longer showed so there can be either a sobreexpression ( meaning both parental genes are expressed) or a diminuition where any of them is expressed.<br /><ul><li>Paternal allele for Igf2 that is a growth factor, is methylated, so is expressed.</li><li>Maternal allele for Igf2 is unmethylated, so no expressed.</li><li>Hypermethylation or hypomethylation, depending on the gene function are signals of lossing imprinting. In this case we have umethylation as a silencing control, so our dissorder for Wilm's tumor is going to be the opposite: hypermethylation for an overexpression.</li><li>When it is unmethylated CTCF binds its insulator element, and it means that the enhancers will act on H19. But if we have loss the imprinting, this is hypermethylated and so CTCF is not bind and no longer inhibiting Igf2, so is expressed also in maternal allele. We have then both paternal and maternal allele expressed and a over- signaling for growth.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a demethylation agent that acts as a inhibitor of BRD4, an epigenetic regulator which blocks the expression of <em>Myc</em> gene. Myc protein is a transcription factor involved in a big ammount of gene expression. When Myc protein is overproduced it causes cancer by causing myeloma proliferation.</li><li>Decitabine produces the demethylation of the histones that are over silencing genes, which tumor supressor genes are among. So it permits the expression of genes that are involved in cell stop-growth.</li><li>Decitabine can act like JQ1 in mice, which blocks BRD4 that at the same time blocks Myc gene. This chain permits the normal expression of Myc protein and avoids the over " transcription" of genes involved in proliferation and growing.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation is a epigenetic control that consist in the addition of a methyl group on DNA chain, so that this proccess modifies histone tails which act as docking sites for proteins. These reading can be by different proteins and depending on that the answer can be the activation or silencing of a gene.<br /><ul><li>Altering DNA methylation can be hypermethylation or hypomethylation meaning depending on the case a over-expression of the gene, a silencing or a over-silencing.</li><li>A sensitive period is a moment in an organism life in which epigenetic marks are being cleared and restablished, so they are key moments for epigenetic changes. </li><li>We consider this periods during germ cell development that takes place in sexual organs, and during early developlment of the embryo.</li><li>Treating patients in sensitive periods would alter the normal restablishment of epigenetic marks due to changes in histone methylation, acethylation and so the cromatine structure. Sensitive periods are important to stablish the imprinting marks which are the ones that goes along with one person´s life.</li></ul><br /></div>
