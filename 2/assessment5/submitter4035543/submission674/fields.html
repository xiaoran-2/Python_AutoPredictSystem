    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The methylation
at CpG islands can lead to silencing of gene expression. In normal cells, CpG
islands are usually unmethylated and the genes are expressed. In caner cell, CpG
islands are hypermethylated and the tumor suppressor genes which are involved
in repressing cell cycle and promoting apoptosis are silenced. Silencing of the
tumor suppressor genes can lead to cancer. In contrast, hypomethylation of CpG
poor promoters in oncogenes can cause oncogene activation and overexpression of
oncogenes can cause cancer. In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive
elements are usually methylated and the methylation can maintain the genomic
stability and integrity. In cancer cells, hypomethylation of Intergenic regions
and repetitive elements can disrupt the genomic stability, such as inducing Illegitimate
recombination between repeats, abnormally activating repeats and transposition,
therefore lead to cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The
H19/Igf2 cluster consists of Igf2, ICR, H19, enhancer and CTCF. In
maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated. CTCF protein binds to ICR and
insulates the Igf2 promoter from downstream enhancer. Therefore Igf2
expression is repressed and H19 expression is promoted. In paternal
allele, methylation at the ICR prevents CFCT from binding. Without CFCT
binding, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter and H19 expression is
repressed. The downstream enhancer accesses to the Igf2 promoter and promotes
Igf2 expression. In normal cells, Igf2 is maternally repressed and paternally
promoted. In Wilm’s tumour, hypermethylation at ICR disrupts CFCT
binding and promotes the expression of Igf2 in maternal allele.  Since
Igf2 is an oncogene and involved in promoting cell growth, overexpression
of Igf2 can results in abnormal cell growth and contributes to cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA
methytransferase(DNMT) inhibitor. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable
because DNMTs can recognize hemi-methylated DNA and restore methylation on both
strands. Decitabine is a nuceloside analogue and can irreversibly bind DNMTs
after it is incorporated into DNA, therefore inhibit DNMTs from laying down
methyl on the newly synthesized DNA strand after the DNA replication. Since
cancer cells proliferate much more frequently than normal cells, in presence of
Decitabine , DNA hypermethylation are diluted after each cell cycle in cancer
cells. In summary, Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect  because it can inhibit<span> <span>DNA methylation by rreversibly binding DNMTs.</span></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA
methylations are mitotically heritable. Once the DNA methylations are built,
they can be passed on to the daughter cell druing each cell division until they
are actively erased. Germ cell development and early embryonic development are
sensitive periods in which the epigenetic reprogramming occurs and epigenetic
marks are cleared and resetted. Therefore disruption of epigenetic
reprogramming can have enduring effects on epigenome. Drugs that alter DNA
methylation have long-lasting effects due to their effects on the epigenetic
machinery and the heritability of DNA methylation. Due to the heritability
of  DNA methylation and the sensitive
periods, we should avoid treating patients with such drugs during the
epigenetic reprogramming periods, such as patiens planning to having a baby or
female patients in eraly pregnancy. For these patients, these drugs may dusrupt
the epigenetic reprogramming in germ cells development and early embryo
development, therefore change the epigenome of the fetus and may cause damaging
effects.</span></p></div>
