    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells DNA
methylation at CpG islands is used for regulating gene activity, while DNA
methylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions is related to genome
stability. However, in cancer DNA methylation can be altered in a several ways
with both DNA hypermethylation occuring at CpG islands which leads to
transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressing genes or DNA hypomethylation
related to repetitive elements and intergenic regions, which leads to decreased
genome stability. DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppressing genes will facilitate
cell division and make cancer cells grow faster than normal cells leading to
tumorigenesis. Decreased genome stability will increase the risk of deletions,
reciprocal translocations, and insertions which leads to transcriptional abnormalities
and to tumorigenesis. However, the role of DNA methylation in general is
context specific where in some tumors DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands
seems to be driving force but in other tumors it might be DNA hypomethylation
of repetitive elements or intergenic regions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Igf2 epigenetic
regulation is determined via imprinting. In normal imprinting the paternal
allele of Igf2 is methylated at the imprinted control region which will lead to
transcription of Igf2 via enhancers. At the maternal allele the imprinted
control region is not methylated which leads to binding of an insulator protein
CTCF which blocs transcription of Igf2. In Wilm’s tumor the imprinted control
region and H19 locus of the maternal allele is hypermethylated together with
the paternal allele which will lead to an increase in Igf2 transcription. As Igf2
is growth promoting the increased Igf2 will lead to the tumorigenesis of Wilm’s
tumor.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is a drug which mediates its effect via inhibiting DNA methyltransferases (DNMTi).
This means that it will decrease DNA methylation creating global DNA hypomethylation.
This effect is dependent of cell division and as cancer cells replicate faster than normal cells the DNMTi will decrease DNA methylation more in cancer cells. Decitabine has been shown to decrease
DNA methylation in both tumor cells and blood cells. Thus Decitabine will be useful for
hypomethylating CpG island hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes in some
cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As DNA
methylation is mitotically heritable it can have lasting effects on the
epigenome as changes in methylation will be transferred during cell division.
As tumor cells in general divide more rapidly than normal cells, they are more susceptible
to changes in DNA methyltransferase activity than normal cells because DNA
methyltransferases inhibitors are division dependent. However, caution should be taken
when giving these drugs to younger people, infants and pregnant women, because they are in a sensitive period
where they undergo more rapid cell division than adult and thus are affected
more severely by the drugs. It might also affect the developing germ cells and
this would affect future generations as well. Thus the long term effects of DNMTi treatment in this group is inadvisable, </p></div>
