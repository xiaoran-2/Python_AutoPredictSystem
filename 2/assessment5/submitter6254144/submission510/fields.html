    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to mostly inactivate genes.</li><li>In cancer, there may mutation of TET proteins involved in DNA methylation or DNMT enzymes or methyl binding domains.</li><li>Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands can lead to expression of oncogenes and suppression of tumor suppressor genes.</li><li>DNA methylation in intergenic <span>regions and repetitive elements maintains genomic stability and hypomethylation of these regions can lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes for e.g. Avy and Axin fusion alleles contributing to development of cancer.</span></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Imprint control region on the paternal allele is methylated and CTCF does not bind to insulate this. Hence, the enhancers can directly act on the Igf2 allele and lead to its expression.  </li><li>The same ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated and CTCF can bind to its insulator element. This causes the enhancers to bind to the H19 allele leading to silencing of Igf2 maternal allele.</li><li>In Wilm's tumor, there is methylation on the maternal allele leading to a loss of imprint control at the maternal allele and double expression of Igf2 leading to excessive growth promotion as compared to a normal cell.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of DNMT inhibitors. It is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly binds to DNMT after being incorporated into DNA  during replication and the methylation is not copied to the daughter strand. Since, the mechanism of action of Decitabine is a replication-dependent process, it is particularly effective in cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and
granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, are irreversible. Hence, epigenetic therapies may effect
changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. Sensitive periods are when epigenetic marks are being embedded in the genes. These are during the primordial cell development upto the blastocyst stage and the germ cell development in younger patients. Any environmental insult like introduction of a drug inhibiting/interfering with the epigenetic mechanisms may produce drastic changes in the fetal genetic make-up. These drugs are not advisable as their effects on other genes have not been completely studied yet.</span></div>
