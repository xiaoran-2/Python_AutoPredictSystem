    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancers and understanding the patterns of DNA methylation in specific cancers can have diagnostic, prognostic, and potentially theraputic value.  In cancer, in some instances DNA is hypermethylated and in others it is hypomethylated.  Generally, in cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated and intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.</p><p>CpG islands are clusters of CpG dinucleotides, more than can be seen by chance, are often foud at promotors.  Methylation of CpG islands is often associated with gene silencing.  In normal cells CpG islands are often protected from methylaton, and therefore, silencing.  In contrast, in cancer cells DNA methylation at CpG islands, particularly those associated with tumor suppressor genes, are hypermethylated.  That is, DNA methylation more often silences tumor suppressor genes than in normal cells enhancing tumorigenicity in these cells.  This can be one of the insults or 'hits' described by the Knudson hypothesis that allow for cancer development.  In fact, DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands has been found in essentially all cancer cells studied.  </p><p><br />Normally, DNA methylation exists in intergenic regions of the genome and in repetative elements.  This provides for the maintenance of genomic stabilty, including limiting illegitimate recombination </p><p>between repeats and limiting the loss or duplication of the DNA.  This occurs because the methylation causes those portions of the DNA to be hetrochromatinized and unavailable for recombination. In contrast, in cancer the genomes are less stable due to DNA hypomethylation at these intergenic regions and repetative elements.  This instability is caused by either activating an intergenic region or repeat or causing a repeat to jump to a new location.  Activating repeats and intergenic regions can allow these regions to be available for recomination or can cause transcriptional aberrations in genes surrounding repeats. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, as can be seen in the H19/Ifg2 cluster.  The ICR in the H19/Igf2 cluster is imprinted or methylated on the paternal allele.  On the paternal allele the methylated ICR does not bind CTCF, so enhancers on that allele induce transcription of Igf2; in the paternal allele the H19 gene is not expressed.  Conversely, the ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated allowing CTCF to bind to the ICR, causing the enhancers cause expression of the H19 gene; in the maternal allele Igf2 is not expressed. </p><p>In Wilm's tumor, the maternal ICR in the H19/Igf2 cluster is also methylated.  As a result, H19 is not expressed in either allele and Igf2 is expressed by both doubling the normal dose of Ifg2. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene and doubling the dose of Igf2 will cause enhanced growth of those cells, allowing those cells to grow and divide more quickly than surrounding cells.  This ICR methylation is thought to occur early in the development of such cancers and could potentially be an early diagnostic marker for Wilm's tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methytransferase inhibitor.  The drug is a nucleoside analog so that it is incorporated into the nucleotide sequence during replication.  Once there, the drug irreversibly binds to DNMT1, inhibiting the action of that enzyme.  DNMT1 is integral to the mitotic heritability of DNA methylation, so inhibiting this will cause DNA demethylation.  In cancer, DNA is hypermethylated at CpG islands related to tumor suppression genes so drug that can reduce this methylation will reduce tumorigenicity of these cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation, and therefore have an impact on epigenetic state of a cell, can have long lasting effects due to the mitotic heritability of epigenetic marks.  While this can mean long lasting beneficial effects with regard to cancer treatment, if drugs that impact the epigenetic state of a cell are given during sensitive periods, that is periods during which epigenetic marks are cleared and reset as part of normal development, those drugs can have long lasting and difficult to predict negative consequences for normal development. Epigenetic sensitive periods include early embryonic development and primordial germs cell development time periods, and to a lesser extent cell specific epigenetic programming.  Epigenetic reprogramming in early embryonic development and primordial germs cell development largely wipe out existing epigenetic marks to restore totipotency during early embryonic development and clearing epigenetic marks and restoring parentally appropriate marks (imprinting genes to designate either the maternal or paternal alleles) in primordial germ cell development.<br /></div>
