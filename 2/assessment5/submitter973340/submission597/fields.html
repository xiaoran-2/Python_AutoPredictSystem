    <div class="field-value">1. Usually kept free of methylation regardless of associated gene function.<br />2. Methylation experiences genome-wide loss and region-specific gain. CpG islands become hypermethylated leading to silencing of the underlying genes.<br />3. Silencing tumor suppressor genes via hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands<br />4. They fulfill important regulatory roles in gene expression and regulation by assembling protein complexes and localizing them to their genomic target DNA sequence. Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been identified at intergenic sites outside protein-coding genes containing H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 domains. Many of these biological active lincRNAs can physically associate with chromatin remodeling complexes and are needed for pluripotency and differentiation.<br />5. Altered methylation (widespread demethylation) is associated with the deregulation of lncRNAs and subsequent re-positioning of chromatin modifying complexes.<br />6. Many developmental genes that are silenced by H3K27me3 in embryonic stem cells are silenced by DNA methylation in cancer cells, establishing an epigenetic switch from a dynamic to a more stable silencing system that promotes a stem cell-like signature of cancer cells. By recruiting certain complexes to form heterochromatin, carcinogenic epigenetic changes mediate silencing of these tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. Cancerous changes in DNA methylation causes genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes with silencing of tumor suppressor genes controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands.<br />1. On the paternal allele, methylation at the ICR not only prevents CTCF from binding, allowing Igf2 to engage the enhancers, but it is also required for methylation at the H19 promoter and silencing of H19.<br />2. On the maternal allele, the unmethylated allows CTCF binding to 4 binding sites within the ICR, generating an insulator that prevents Igf2 from accessing the shared enhancers that are located on the H19 side of the insulator. Thus, the insulator effectively acts as an enhancer-blocker. <br />3. H19 RNA was reduced at least 20-fold from fetal kidney levels. <br />H19 DNA was biallelically hypermethylated or hypermethylation locally restricted to H19 sequences. IGF2 mRNA was expressed in most but not all WTs and expression patterns were consistent with IGF2/H19 enhancer competition without inverse coupling. <br />4. Epigenetic inactivation of H19 is found in Wilms' tumors.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. As such it can clear the cancerous inappropriate epigenetic methylation. Decitabine reverses methylation and hence silencing of tumor-suppression genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic effects are mitotically heritable, passed on to daughter cells during division. Therefore, until erased, the epigentic changes in the tissue cells are maintained. A sensitive period would be during embryonic development or during gamete development, where epigenetic imprinting takes place. Therefore a demethylation treatment for cancer in the host body could have detrimental effect upon the offspring.<br /></div>
