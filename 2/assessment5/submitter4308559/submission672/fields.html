    <h1>Submission 672 from Anon (session_user_id: cbc6438fe4c04137c73a94bef75cbcdc4247d241)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to DNMT inhibitors (DNA
methyltransferase inhibitors). It is a kind of nucleoside analogues which,
after being incorporated into DNA, will irreversibly bind DNMTs. With this
depletion of DNMTs, decitabine will thus globally demethylating the genome upon
replication and overall the epigenome will become hypomethylated. This drug
will demethylate all the replicating cells as it is not selective. Decitabine
is FDA approved to treat myelodysplastic syndrome which will later progressed
to acute myeloid leukaemia, these kinds of cancers generally have their tumour
suppressor gene hypermethylated. With the effect of decitabine in
globally demethylating the epigenome among actively replicating cells, those
leukaemia cells will be greatly affected and have their epigenome become hypomethylated.
Then this hypomethylation would also make the previously heavily methylated
tumour suppressor genes demethylated and hence re-activated. With the
reactivation of the tumour-suppressor gene, the proliferation of the leukaemia
cells can then be under control. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In paternal allele of H19/Igf2 cluster, the
imprint control region (ICR) is methylated and blocks the binding of CTCF.
Without the binding of CTCF, the methylation of ICR would spread to the
promoter of H19 gene. H19 gene is thus inactivated and the downstream enhancers,
without the effect of CTCF, will then access Igf2 to activate its expression. </p>

<p>In maternal allele, the ICR is not
methylated and allows binding of CTCF. CTCF is an insulator protein that blocks
the downstream enhancer from accessing the Igf2 gene. Hence the downstream
enhancer will alternatively act on H19 gene and activate it. </p>

<p><span>In Wilm’s tumour, the ICR at the maternal allele
will also be methylated and blocks the binding of CTCF. Without the CTCF the
downstream enhancers will then activate the Igf2 gene. H19 gene in the maternal
allele is inactivated by the spread of methylation from ICR. Thus in the tumour
there will be Igf2 overexpression and H19 under-expression. Since Igf2 is a
growth promoting gene, overexpression of Igf2 would make growth uncontrollable
and hence result in cancer. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In
normal cells the CpG islands of some growth-controlling genes such as tumour
suppressor genes are usually hypomethylated, which allows such genes to be
actively transcribed and exert their effects: controlling growth and therefore
preventing cancer. However, in cancer cell the CpG islands of tumour suppressor
genes are usually heavily methylated, this hypermethylation of CpG islands
would render the corresponding genes inactive. As the tumour suppressor genes
get inactivated by DNA methylation at their CpG islands, their gene products
are no longer synthesized and hence the growth of the cells will become
uncontrollable, which leads to cancer. </p>

<p><span>In normal cells the intergenic regions and
repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated so as to maintain the genomic
stability: the hypermethylation will keep those regions in the heterochromatin
state, hence preventing the occurrence of illegitimate recombination between
repeats, transposition or activation of cryptic promoters. However, in cancer
cell the intergenic region and repetitive elements are usually hypomethylated.
This means those regions are now in open chromatin state. Due to the similar
sequence between repetitive elements, illegitimate recombination would occur
between repeats and results in deletions, insertions or reciprocal
translocations. Transposition would become possible as well, and since the
repeats may contain some promoter activities and their transposition may
disrupt or activated the genes in the newly transposed regions. If these
events, illegitimate recombination and transposition, turn out to activate some
oncogenes or disrupt some tumour-suppressor genes, cancer would result. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable
(DNMT1 will maintain the DNA methylation status upon cell division), any DNA
methylation changes that are brought about by drugs will be passed on to
daughter and granddaughter cells upon cell division and all the clones will
inherit that DNA methylation changes. </p>

<p>With this long lasting effect, it is not
advisable to treat patients during sensitive periods where massive epigenetic
reprogramming is taking place and hence susceptible to any environmental
changes and epigenetic manipulation. This sensitive periods are during early
development and during primordial germ cells development, last but not least,
during differentiation in some organs at particular stage in later life. </p>

<p><span>As there are epigenetic reprogramming undergoing
in this sensitive period, any epigenetic manipulations brought about by drugs
would therefore disrupt the reprogramming and disrupt the resulting epigenome
methylation pattern. The resulting cells possessing the disrupted, abnormal methylation
status will produce cells that have the same aberrations and this would be very
disastrous and have a life-long effect, say, malformation of some organs,
infertility etc. </span></p></div>
