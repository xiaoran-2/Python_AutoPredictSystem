    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands normally  tend to be unmethylated, but when methylation occurrs, it leads to silencing of gene expression. Methylation of a cytosine in a CpG island associates with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure and with limitation in the access of transcription factors to the DNA.</p><p>In cancer, the CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated leading to
mitotically heritable silencing of tumor suppressor genes, thus conferring selective
advantage of epimutations.<br /></p><p>Intergenic and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal circumstances and it serves as a mechanism to maintain genomic integrity.</p><p>In cancer, changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes - controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair - by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 cluster is imprinted on the paternal allele, meaning that the imprinted control region is methylated in the paternal chromosome. H19 is a long non-coding RNA that is produced from the maternal allele and serves as a reservoir for a particular RNA.  The imprinting control region is unmethylated in the maternal allele, it is bound by a protein called CTCF (insulator protein), that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers, but instead enhances H19 expression on the maternal chromosome. The methylation of the ICR on the paternal allele prevents the binding of CTCF with then leaves the enhancers free to act on Igf2 which in turn is expressed.<br /><br />Since Igf2 is an oncogene that promotes cellular growth, deletion or mutation at the maternal allele causes loss of imprinting at the Igf2/H19 cluster, leading to uniparental disomy, this is, both copies of the cluster acting like there were from paternal origen, and therefore causing overexpression of Igf2. This is the mechanism that explain the association of alteration in this cluster with Wilm's tumor, and that contributes to cancer by abnormal stimulation of cell growth mediated by overexpression of Igf2.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to class of DNA-demethylating agents used in the treatment of myelodisplasic syndromes. Decitabine is an hypomethylating agent that acts by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. When  DNA methylation is increased, this leads to the blockage in the activity of "suppressor genes" that control and regulate growth  and cell division. Blocking of  suppressor genes  leads to dysregulation of  cell division allowing or promoting cancer. <br /><br />The epigenetic anticancer effects of Decitabine occur by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  In this process of demethylation, the normal function of the tumor suppressor genes is restored, therefore restoring the control over cell growth and multiplication.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">He argues that epigenetic changes can be passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. <br /><br />Sensitive periods are periods  when changes in the environment are having the biggest effect. They correspond to periods of active remodeling of the epigenome.These periods are germ cell development and early embryonic development.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods can have the broadest effects, including disruption of the re-setting of imprinting patterns at the imprint control regions.</div>
