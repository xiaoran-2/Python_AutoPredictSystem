    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are long sequential cytosine-guanine bases, rather than cytosine-guanine base pairing, found usually in promoter regions in mammals. The cytosine nucleotides can be methylated, that is the addition of a methyl group that converts cytosine to 5-methylcytosine by DNA methyltransferases, and is usually associated with silencing of the gene which they reside in its promoter. Unmethylated state is, hence, associated with expression of that particular gene. Therefore, gene expression can be modulated by epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation without changing the genetic sequence.  Human cancers which show no apparent mutation in the genetic sequence, despite silencing of genes are now associated with epimutations on their promoters instead. Tumour suppressor genes act to promote apoptosis to avoid excessive cell proliferation or to repress cell cycle so that cell division is inhibited. Methylation of CpG islands in the promoter of these genes cause silencing, therefore, resulting in cancer formation. Similarly, CpG island hypomethylation in oncogene promoters, which when mutated cause the cells to gain resistance to apoptosis and survival, eventually leading to cancer.<br />DNA methylation is seen in other regions than CpG islands along the DNA, again on cytosine as well as adenine bases. Methylation at these intergenic regions cause a physical barrier for transcriptional machinery to bind, thus, silencing the gene. This also avoids expression of the anti-sense transcripts. In primary colon cancer, genome-wide hypomethylation was observed, which involved genes that are involved in replication and cell matrix remodelling. Hypomethylation in genes as such causes excess activation of the genes leading to enhanced proliferative and metastatic ability, that are main features of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 is a tumour suppressor gene that is maternally imprinted, implicated with Russell-Silver Syndrome whereas IGF2 codes for a growth factor and is paternally imprinted. IGF2 is associated with sporadic tumours and Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome upon upregulation. H19 and IGF2 reciprocally coregulate each other. On the maternal allele, unmethylated ICR allows CTCF binding so that IGF2 promoter cannot interact with enhancers and is silenced. On a competition basis, H19 promoter can bind to the enhancers to be transcribed. On the other hand, on the paternal allele, imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated, thus, CTCF cannot bind, allowing for IGF2 to interact with enhancers and be transcribed while H19 is silenced. </p><p>Paternal uniparental disomy at 11p15 locus resulting biallelic IGF2 expression and loss of imprinting at IGF2 leading to hypermethylation at H19 are recently shown to be causal for Wilms' tumour. Biallelic expression of IGF2 causes production of double the dose of the growth factor leading to excess growth i.e. cancer, as there is no H19 to counteract this effect. On the other hand, hypermethylation of H19 silences the gene allowing for IGF2 to be expressed in excess, again leading to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that inhibits DNA methyltransferase. Therefore, Decitabine causes global or gene specific hypomethylation of DNA. This is important in cancers, such as chronic myeloid leukemia, that are caused by hypermethylation, i.e silencing, of genes such as tumour suppressor genes. Reexpression of these genes caused by demethylation activity of Decitabine is likely to restore the activity of the genes allowing for suppression of cancer progression. For example, CpG islands tend to be methylated heavily causing silencing of those genes. Decitabine would potentially lower the amount of DNA methylation on CpG islands  and restoring the endogenous expression of the genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is usually considered as irreversible. That means once methylated, i.e. silenced, that gene stays silenced throughout life. Maintenance DNA methyltransferases recognise the methylation pattern, upon replication, and  maintain this pattern by copying to the newly synthesized DNA strand. Therefore, effects exerted by epigenetic drugs such as methylation agents will have enduring effects that will be mitotically stable and may be heritable.<br />Sensitive periods during development are those timepoints that epigenetic changes take place. Embryogenesis, PGC development and early development periods are particularly sensitive to epigenetic changes. As an example, right after fertilisation, stochastic loss of DNA methylation occurs in both paternal and maternal DNA, except for imprinted genes and repeat elements. This loss of methylation is likely to activate genes that direct differentiation. Interference with drugs at this stage, to the mother, will likely result in altered epigenome and therefore disrupt development of the embryo. Therefore, treatment with epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods should be avoided to allow proper epigenetic reprogramming.</div>
