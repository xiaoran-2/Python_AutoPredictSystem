    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation occurs in cells, and patterns of methylation are associated with a stable genome; a common pattern is hypomethylation of CpG islands near promoters and methylation of both intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Disruption of this pattern of DNA methylation disrupts genomic stabilty and that this disruption of stabilty contributes to cancer.<br /><br />In normal cells, CpG islands near promoters tend to remain free from methylation. This pattern of methylation allows accessibiltity of promoter regions to transcription factors. A gene may or may not be expressed, but the chromatin remains in an accessible conformation that permits gene expression.<br /><br />In cancer cells, CpG islands become hypermethylated, leading to silencing of the gene, as hypermethylation leads to a more compacted chromatin structure. Inappropriate methylation of CpG islands can contribute to cancer because you may silence a tumor suppressing gene, such as the <i>RB</i> gene in retinoblastoma and <i>MGMT</i> in glimoas and colorectal tumors. Different types of tumors will display different patterns in which CpG islands are hypermethylated.<br /><br />The normal function of methylation of intergenic and repetetive elements is to repress gene expression and promote genomic stablilty.  Intergenic regions may be methylated to silence cryptic transcription start sites. Repetitive elements are associated with transposable elements, so methylation helps deter jumping of transposons, and possibly decrease recombination between chromosomes.<br /><br />In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated, Hypomethlation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is associated with genomic instability, such as duplication, deletions, insertions and translocations, as well as activation of cryptic promoters. Genomic instability is the most common feature of cancer cells. These events occur early in tumorigenesis and progress with time to more serious defects in the cell.<br /><br />Thus, both inappropriate hypermethylation and hypomethylation can lead to cancer via different mechanisms. Context is key for understanding the effects of DNA methylation.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster provides an example of how a loss of imprinting can contribute to cancer.<br /><br />In normal cells the paternal allele expresses Igf2 because the imprint control region (ICR) near the H19 promoter is methlyated, preventing the CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) factor from binding, which in turn allows downstream enhancers to direct expression of Igf2. In this case, methylation of the ICR allows transcription.<br /><br />The normal maternal allele has an unmethylated ICR, which allows the CTCF to bind, which in turns blocks the action of the downstream enhancers by creating a chromatin structure that cannot be accessed by the enhancers, thus silencing Igf2 transcription from the maternal allele.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, the ICR region of both the maternal and paternal genes is hypermethylated. This allows both copies of the Igf2 gene to be expressed because the silencing structure cannot assemble, as CTCF cannot bind to the methylated ICR. Expression of Igf2 from both alleles leads to a double dose of Igf2 and is believed to cause increased growth of cells that have lost imprint control.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is an analog of cytidine, and must be incorporated into DNA (in place of cytidine) of growing cells to become active, Once incorporated into DNA, it irreversibly binds to DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) effectively decreasing levels of DNMT1 in the cell. Decreased levels of DNMT1 allows a gradual reduction in the levels of DNA methylation. Decitabine has been shown to be effective against myeloid cancers, and works well at a low dose given over several weeks. The low doses decrease toxicity.<br /><br />Inhibiting DNA methylation can have an anti-tumour effect because decreasing levels of methylation appears to help activate genes that have been silenced during carcinogeneis. Activation of the silenced genes often restores a tumour-suppressing activity in the cell that have been turned off by excessive levels of methylation at CpG islands in the promoters of the silenced genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes in DNA methylation can persist beyond the period of drug treatment due to the mitotic heritablity of DNA methylation; methylation persists following cell division. <br /><br />Care must be taken not to administer agents that affect epigenetic mechanisms during "sensitive" periods of development. Sensitive periods of development are periods of active demethylation of the genome. These periods include the preimplantation and early development of the embryo, and the period of primordial germ cell development.<br /><br />Administering agents that can alter methylation state during periods of sensitivity could have long lasting impacts, influencing future generations if primordial germ cells are affected. Therefore, treatments in children and pregnant women must be approached with caution.<br /><br /></div>
