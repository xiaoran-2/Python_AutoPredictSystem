    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor belonging to the class of the <strong>DNA-demethylating agents</strong>. <br /><br />This means that Decitabine is capable of <strong>eliminating methylation</strong> on the DNA, inducing a hypomethylated state in the treated cells. <br /><br />Some cancers are caused by hypermethylation on the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. These genes tend to avoid cell cycle progression and immortality of the cell. However, in some cancers these genes have their promoter methylated and thus they aren't expressed properly. This causes cell cycle desregulation and the appearence of malignancy. <br />Decitabine would <strong>decrease the methylation on the tumor suppressor genes' promoters</strong>, hence allowing its expression and avoiding malignant transformation. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">At CpG islands, DNA methylation <strong>leads to silencing</strong> of the genes and condensation of the DNA in general. <br /><br />In a normal cell, the CpG islands are normally hypomethylated. A common feature in cancer is <strong>hypermethylation of CpG islands.<br /></strong><br />This causes the <strong>silencing of tumor suppressor genes</strong>, a mechanism that is often more frequent than genetic mutations. <br /><br />On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are<strong> normally hypermethylated</strong>. This helps to regulation of the genome. <strong>Repetitive elements</strong> tend to be detrimental when active, and thus their inactivation through methylation helps genome stability. The<strong> intergenic regions</strong> constitute the majority of DNA matherial in a cell. This means a lot of space would be needed. DNA methylation leads to condensation. Moreover, when condensed, the DNA is less weak. If the intergenic regions are methylated, they are less breakable, and this is another mechanism for genome stability. Also it avoids illegitimate recombinations, activation of repeats, and transposition. <br /><br />In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are often found to be <strong>hypomethylated</strong>. <br /><br />The hypomethylation of these regions contributes to cancer because<strong> the genome is less stable when they aren't methylated</strong>. The DNA is weaker and it can likely break more easily than when it's condensed by methylation. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the <strong>maternal allele</strong> the imprint control region is not methylated. In this status it can bind
 CTCF, a protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. In the 
paternal allele, in consequence,<strong> Igf2 is not expressed</strong> and instead the 
enhancers are free to act on H19, which is expressed. <br /><br />In the <b>paternal allele</b> the imprint control region is methylated and CTCF cannot bind. The enhancers promote<strong> Igf2 expression</strong> instead of H19's. <br /><br />Wilm's tumour is the very common in Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome. In this tumour, the maternal copy is also methylated, resembling the paternal one. The hypermethylation of the ICR results in overexpression of Igf2. <br /><br />Igf2 is an oncogene, in other words, a growth promoting gene. The overexpression caused by the epigenetic desregulation leads to a dramatic increase in the oncogene production, and thus an uncontroled growth. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic form of regulation. The epigenome of the cell is inhereted by daughter cells, and thus the <strong>methylation on the DNA is inhereted</strong> as well. If DNA methylation is modified, this alteration would be passed through subsequent cell generations. <br /><br />A sensitive period of development is that when <strong>DNA methylation is being removed or laid down. </strong><br /><br />These are the <strong>pre-implantational state</strong> and the <strong>primordial germ cell development</strong>. <br /><br />If treated during these sensitive periods, the patients would have their DNA methylation affected. At these periods, DNA methylation is being resetted. The epigenetic drug would <strong>desregulate this process</strong> and this would have <strong>long lasting consequences</strong> because epigenetic changes are passed from a cell to its daughters.<br /></div>
