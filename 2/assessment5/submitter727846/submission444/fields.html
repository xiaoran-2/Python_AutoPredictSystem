    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are found at a higher frequency than by chance often at promoter regions of genes.  Methylation tends not to occur at CpG islands.  If found, they are associated with silencing, making DNA methylation at CpG islands an inactive epigenetic mark.<br /><br />Methylation of CpG islands is associated with the formation of repressive chromatin structure.  CpG binding proteins have a DNA binding domain and a transcription repression domain and recruit other factors that aid in chromatin condensation.<br /><br />DNA methylation generally occurs at repetitive elements, at intergenic regions and at introns of genes.  Methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is associated with genome stability.  Methylation of long repetitive elements (LTR) usually located surrounding a DNA region silence them, thus preventing them from transposing to other parts of the genome where they may be mutagenic and disrupt transcription of expression from the strong promoter sequences contained within the LTRs as it occurs in cancer.  Methylation of those repeats also prevent illegitimate recombination.  Compaction of the genome is assured through methylation to prevent euchromatin formation and illegitimate recombination. DNA methylation, although highly mutagenic, protect genome from transposable elements jumping all over the genome.<br /><br />In cancer cells CpG islands are likely to be more methylated than in a normal cell at tumor suppressor promoter regions. Since the methylation is mitotically heritable, this assures that the tumor suppressor genes are inactive and, at the same time, give cancer cells growth advantage over normal cells.  The set of CpG islands hypermethylation in a tumor suppressor genes may differ from those in another tumor suppressor gene.  As cancer progresses, an increase of methylation of CpG islands is observed, the intergenic and intron regions are hypomethylated, allowing euchromatin formation and more transposition of regions surrounded by LTRs affecting gene expression to surrounding genes and over expressing them.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation does not necessarily correlate with silencing of gene expression, for example in imprint control regions (ICR).  The H19/Igf2 cluster in human chromosome 11 is controlled by an enhancer blocking mechanism.  The cluster contains in this order: the Igf2 growth promoter gene, an ICR, the H19 gene and enhancers downstream. The ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele.<br /><br />On the unmethylated ICR of the maternal allele, binding of the CCCTC sequence-binding factor, CTCF, blocks the enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promoter upstream, therefore insulating it.  The enhancer, then is only able to activate the closer H19 promoter.<br /><br />On the paternal allele, the methylated ICR prevents binding of CTCF. Also the differentially methylated domain of H19 is methylated.  The methylation of these two regions prevent expression of H19 and at the same time allow the enhancers to reach the Igf gene enabling its expression.<br /><br />In pre-neoplastic tissues of Wilm's tumor, there is hypermethylation of the ICR and in the differentially methylated region of H19, CTFC no longer insulates Igf2 in the maternal alleles producing expression of Igf2, thus giving the cell a double dose of the tissue growth promoter Igf2 as compared to normal cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a cytosine analogue and a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that irreversible binds to DNA methyltransferases DNMT) after they are incorporated into DNA.  Therefore the DNA needs to be replicating, as in cancer cells, for Decitabine to be effective.<br /><br />Decitabine may render DNMT ineffective in 
hypermethylated CpG islands associated with silenced tumor suppressor genes in cancer.  
Decitabine has been shown to reactivate silenced tumor suppressor genes <i>in vitro</i> (1).   <br /><br />As the DNMT is bound irreversible, Decitabine may also indirectly reduce its concentration, which may reduce loss of imprinting, if any, in developing haematopoietic cells.  <br /><br />(1) Carlo Stresemann and Frank Lyko.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The incorporation of DNMTi into DNA may signal DNA repair which in turn, if ineffective, may signal cell death in cancer cells.  That is, epigenetic therapy may render cancer cells more susceptible to cytotoxic therapy, maybe because cancer cells may be going through a stem cell-like reprogramming state.<br /><br />Altering DNA methylation may activate normal silenced genes or silence normally active genes.  In turn, it may lock silencing of temporal silenced genes in the genome.  These alterations may change the architecture of normal chromatin genome-wide by disrupting gene expression, changing chromosome ploydi, deleting or duplicating chromosomo regions as in many cancer.<br /><br />Sensitive periods are those when active remodelling of the epigenome is taking place: 1. the period from primordial germ cell development through the production of mature eggs and sperm.  The second sensitive period is the pre-implantation period and early post-implantation period.  Younger patients may be carrying developing germ cells.  Taking a drug that inhibits epigenetic machinery during the production of mature eggs and sperms may disrupt the epihenome detrimentally.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
