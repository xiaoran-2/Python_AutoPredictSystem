    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are sites of methylation which primery function is to silence gene by blocking promoter via changing charge of chromatin.<br />Hypermethylation of CpG can results in transcriptional silencing of genes-suppressors.<br />Silencing of genes-suppressors can results in malfunction of cell division regulation system and thus cell may begin nonstop dividing.<br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are important for chromatin folding.<br />While cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements can be hypomethylated which causes illegitimate recombination between repeats, transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes.<br />This effects of hypomethylation can lead to genomic instability and oncogene activation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There is loss of imprinting in any allele of H19-enhancers (H19 suppress Igf2) in some parts of the brain and malignant tumors but there is imprinting in most normal tissues (methylation in paternal allele means expression of Igf2; lack of methylation in maternal allele means repression of Igf2) thus in normal cells is normal dose of Igf2.<br />In Wilm’s tumour, H19/Igf2 region is hypermethylated and thus Igf2 is overexpressed -- there will be double dose from maternal and paternal alleles and thus the tumor formation is observed.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is a cytidine analog. It is demethylating agent -- methyl-binding proteins can't methylate this substance but decitabine can integrate into DNA and replace cytidine.<br />Because many tumors are caused by hypermethylation, local treatment of tumor with decitabine can lead to loss of methylation while DNA replication. It can be helpful if combinated with classic chemotherapy because of lower effective doses.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is inherited through generations of the cells via DNA methyltransferase activity during mitosis.<br />Sensitive period is period of ontogeny when epigenetic reprogramming occuring. To be precise, pre-implantation development and germ cell development are sensitive periods of human development.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because of epigenetic disorders which can be caused by drugs like folic acid or BPA. It can be lethal because of necessity of epigenetic marks for cell differentiation and function, or epimutations can be inherited and next generations will suffer from epimutations.<br /></div>
