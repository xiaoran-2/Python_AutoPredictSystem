    <div class="field-value"><p>
CpG
islands are collections of CpG sites in the genome that are often associated with the
start of a gene. They help to promote the gene's expression. Because they have a high number of Cystine and Guanine bases (the C and G of CpG), they are easily methylated at the Cystine.  This methylation usually silences the CpG island, and since they are necessary for gene expression, the result is that the gene is not expressed. The genes that are not expressed tend to be those associated with tumor suppression. </p><p>In cancer, CpG islands
become hypermethylated over a period of time. This means they  then
tend to silence the expression of genes that are associated with
normal cell growth (tumor suppression genes) and the cell(s) begin to grow abnormally. The
result is cells which grow and divide uncontrollably or even cells
which become immortal (do not die). These cells ultimately produce
tumors and some become cancerous. </p>
<p>
Intergenic
regions and repetitive elements show the opposite tendency. Normally
they are highly methylated, but in cancer cells they are
hypomethylated.  In this case the genomic stability is affected
because the chromatin is opened up instead of being tightly compact
and this allows abnormalities like deletions, insertions and
recombinations to take place, setting off disruption  and
uncontrolled cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>
In
the paternal allele normal imprinting results in the methylation of
the ICR
(Imprint Control Region) associated with the H19 gene. This means the
enhancers cannot access H19 and instead promote the expression of
Igf2. In the maternal allele the same ICR is unmethylated, CTCF can
bind to it and allow the enhancers to promote the expression of H19, while Igf2 remains silenced.</p>
<p>
<span>In
Wilm's tumor, a disruption of imprinting results in the ICRs associated
with the H19 gene in <b>both</b>
the maternal and paternal alleles being menthylated. This causes the
enhancers in both alleles to promote the expression of Igf2 ,
resulting in a “double dose” . This overexpression of a gene due
to a loss of  imprinting causes a kidney tumor in children known as
Wilm's tumor.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>
Because
changes in the epigenome are passed on to daughter and granddaughter
cells mitotically, altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects
– particularly on somatic cells. Thus, drugs that alter DNA
methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug
treatment. This is probably what made the tumour cells Dr Baylin referred to more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy well after the drug had been
administered.</p>
<p>
During
development there are “sensitive periods” epigenomically
speaking. These are points in development where the epigenome is
erased and restablished. One of these times is in very early
development, just after fertilization and before embryo implantation
and the other is when the primordial germ cells are being
manufactured in the embryo. Another sensitive period might be when
one of the X chromosomes is undergoing silencing in the female
somatic cells or when cells are undergoing growth spurts, e.g. in
young children.</p>
<p>
Because
these drugs affect all of the cells, not just the cancer cells,
treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because the
effect on the  epigenome  of the somatic cells is passed on and might cause long term problems if the normal gene expression is changed because of the epigenetic modification.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA transferase methyl
inhibitor. It is drug which acts on an enzyme that is involved in the
epigenetic process. The enzyme is DNA methyltransferase. The drug
irreversibly binds this enzyme in dividing cells and the result is
DNA demethylation (the removal of methyl groups from DNA). Since hypermethylation tends to silence gene expression, this demethylation can then result in changes in the
gene expression. </p><p>When a previously silenced gene  which is involved in tumor suppression is expressed, Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect by allowing the suppression of cell growth in tumors. Since it only acts on dividing cells, cancer cells are
particularly susceptible to it, but other cells can also be affected.</p></div>
