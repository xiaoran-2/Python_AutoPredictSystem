    <div class="field-value">Normally at CpG islands <strong>DNA is unmethylated(or hypo-methylated)</strong> so as to allow gene transcription but in cancer, DNA at CpG islands is more likely to be <strong>hypermethylated</strong> leading to silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Now tumor suppressor genes, as the name suggests, are the ones that would produce protein that would suppress tumor and maintain normal cell conditions. But in cancer, CpG islands at the promoter of these genes are hyper-methylated and hence transcription of these genes are disrupted and hence there is no expression(protein product) and hence tumor growth occurs and this leads to cancer. Also CpG poor promoters can turn a normal cell to cancer cell by having hypo-methylation and hence cancer occurs because transcription of the oncogene can now easily take place.<br />DNA methylation genome wide i.e. in intergenic regions and repetitive regions is normally hyper-methylated. This is understandable because we don't <strong>want repetitive regions to transcribe and jump as transposons</strong> from one place to another leading to genomic instability. In cancer these intergenic and repetitive regions are hypo-methylated which causes repetitive elements to express themselves, jump around the genome causing recombination between between different chromosomes and hence leading to genomic instabilty and thus cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 cluster provides a very nice example of imprinting. Igf2 gene is responsible for growth promoting hormone during gestation. In the normal cell Igf2 gene is maternally imprinted i.e. it is only expressed from the allele coming from father. In paternal allele, the imprint control region(ICR) is heavily methylated and hence insulator like <strong>CTCF is unable to bind the region and hence H19 gene is methylated too</strong> and is not expressed so as to produce long non coding RNA. The enhancer downstream acts directly on Igf2 since it is not insulated by CTCF and hence we have Igf2 expression. In maternal allele, the ICR region is hypo-methylated and hence CTCF binds this region and downstream enhancers act on H19 only and not on Igf2 upstream because CTCF insulator prevents the action of enhancers on Igf2. In Wilm's tumor H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted because <strong>of hyper methylation of ICR at maternal allele</strong>. Because of this CTCF can't bind to maternal ICR region and now we have over expression of Igf2(both paternal and maternal allele express Igf2 now). This imprinting disruption leads to excess of growth promoting hormone which lead to cancer later on because of over expression of Igf2.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a class of drug that inhibits DNA methyltransferases. It is used for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. Decitabine belongs <strong>DNMTi </strong>epigenetic inhibitors class. The role of DNMT is to transfer methyl groups to DNA. When decitabine is administered, then they get incorporated into the DNA, and when DNMT's come , the drug irreversibly binds to DNMT's and hence does not allow the release of DNMT's. Since these inhibitors are replication dependent, therefore DNMT's are not released when cell replication occurs and hence in cancer cells which divide far more rapidly then normal cells are affected in great deal. This means that decitabine is not allowing DNMT's to do their function properly in cancer cells and hence cancer cells do not survive. So low dosage of Decitabine has shown <strong>anti - neoplastic</strong> effect leading to DNA demethylation since DNMT's are not available as they are bound by decitabine.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alteration of DNA methylation is a phenomenon that can turn genes on or off . This can have long term effect on the epigenome. Treatment of cells with demethylating drugs  produces somehow a memory<strong> anti-tumor response </strong>even when the drugs were stopped and patient were kept on standard chemotherapy(Dr Stephen Baylin studies). Based on this memory of the treated cells it can be said that drugs have effects beyond the period of drug treatment.<br />A sensitive period is the one where genome undergoes epigenetic changes in terms of DNA methylation, imprinting etc. Basically there are 2 sensitive periods of development<br /><strong>1. Pre Implantation period (up to blastocyst stage)</strong><br /><strong>2. Primordial Germ cell development period.</strong><br /><br />Treatment of patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable. This is because the genome is undergoing enormous amount of changes in terms of epigenetic changes and and any treatment during these period would result in heritable effects of those changes in daughter cells which will not have a good impact on future generations. Genome is undergoing DNA demethylation and then re methylation etc and using drugs would harm the normal epigenetic process.</div>
