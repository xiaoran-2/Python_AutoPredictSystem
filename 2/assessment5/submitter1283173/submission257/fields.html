    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">ICR (imprint control region) is unmethylated on maternal allele allowing binding of CTCF insulator protein. H19 promoter is active, IGf2 is silenced, because its enhancers cannot access Igf2 due to presence of CTCF.<br /><br />On paternal allele, ICR is methylated. Methylation spreads silencing H19 promoter. Nearby enhancers can now access Igf2 to activate it.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, ICR is methylated on both alleles. That causes Igf2 to be overexpressed. The imprinting is lost. <span>An increased amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 may stimulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells from being destroyed.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. DNA methyltransferase is needed in methylation process. Reduced expression of DNA methyltransferase in turn reduces methylation, so many problems related to hypermethylation (like genome instability, silenced tumour suppressor genes) could be reverted. This drug is especially effective in drugs where excessive hypermethylation is the biggest issue.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. So once a new methylation pattern have been established after drug application, it will be replicated by all the cells that divide and replicate continuously, including the cancer cells. The sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are actively remodelled. In embryogenesis/gametogenesis epigenetics marks are established. But also some studies shown that in childhood development there are some periods that could change some of the epigenetic marks. Treating patients during sensitive periods could disrupt the process of setting epigenetic marks that in consequence could result in many new disorders for that individual.</div>
