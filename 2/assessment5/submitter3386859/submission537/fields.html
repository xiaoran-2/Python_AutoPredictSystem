    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Both locus-specific DNA hypermethylation and genome wide DNA hypomethylation can contribute to cancer. First, in normal cells, CpG islands are not methylated, whearas in cancer cells, DNA hypermethylation can be observed at CpG islands so that tumour suppressor genes are silenced in cancer. Second, in normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are often methylated; in contrast, genome-wide hypomethylation occurs in cancer cells, leading to genomic instability including abnormal deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, ICRs of the paternal allele are methylated, allowing the enhancers to facilitate the expression of lgf2 and leaving H19 silenced. In contrast, ICRs of the maternal allele are not methylated due to the interference of CTCF, thereby forcing the enhancers to act on H19, and lgf2 is silenced. In Wilm's tumour, ICRs are hypermethylated, causing loss of imprinting: H19 is silenced in both maternal and paternal alleles, and lgf2 is activated in both alleles. Because lgf2 is a growth promoter gene, a double dose lgf2 expression will lead to abnormal cell growth, thereby contributing to Wilm's tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a type of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) which is nuceloside analogues, and can irreversibly bind DNMTs after the Decitabine is incorporated into DNA. Consequently, upon replication, DNMTs can no longer bind the nucleotide to copy DNA methylation to its daughter strand. Very high doses of Decitabine is toxic, and will act nonspecifically to all cells. In order to target specifically on cancer cells, much smaller doses should be administrated to trigger anti-neoplastic effects which lead to DNA demethylation of tumour suppressor genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because it is mitotically heritable. A sensitive period is defined as when epigenetic reprogramming occurs and epigenetic marks are established. Two sensitive periods of development include early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. Treating patients during sensitive periods could have irreversibly alter the epigenetic machinery of embryonic cells and/or primordial germ cells, thereby affecting the epigenome of the children and/or grandchildren. Therefore, it would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods.</div>
