    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are normally unmethylated to preserve the binding sites for transcription factors at the promoters. They need to be protected from methylation  because DNA methylation silences gene expression. <br /><br />DNA methylation of CpG islands is mutagenic because 5-methyl cytosine is easily deaminated to thymine. This increases TG dinucleotides and reduces CG residues in the genome. Hypermethylation of CpG islands contributes to genomic instability leading to illegitimate deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, and/or duplication or loss of chromosomes, which ultimately leads to the development of cancer.

<br /><br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions maintains genomic integrity and stability by silencing of expression on a cryptic promoter or a cryptic splice site, which would otherwise lead to deletion, insertion, duplication of whole chromosome, translocation between chromosomes, or transcriptional interference, leading to the development of cancer.

<br /><br />DNA methylation of repetitive elements promotes genomic integrity by silencing of the repeats to prevent transposition, mutation of methyl cytosines into thymines, transcriptional interference from strong promoters to make make the gag and pol protein, and illegitimate recombination. Therefore, hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements induces genomic instability which ultimately leads to the development of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since the imprint control region (ICR) of the paternal allele is methylated, CTCF cannot bind 
to Igf2, so enhancers can act on Igf2 and promote its expression. The H19 
promoter of the paternal allele is silenced because it is methylated by 
virtue of DNA methylation spread from the ICR.<br /><br />Although the maternal allele in the Igf2 ICR is unmethylated, it is inhibited from expression as it is bound by CTCF, an insulator protein which blocks Igf2 from downstream enhances. These enhancers act on the H19 as a secondary preference to enhance its expression through chromatin looping. <br /><br />Wilmer’s tumour is an imprint disorder resulting from suppression of Cdkn1c (tumour suppressor) and up regulation of Igf2, an oncogene that promotes growth. The result is similar to having two paternal-like alleles and loss of the maternal-like allele. Disruption of ICR on the maternal allele is attributed to mutation or deletion within the region, uniparental disomy (two copies of one parental chromosome), or epigenetic disruption (disruption of DNA methylation imprints).

<br /><br />Disruption of ICR at the H19/Igf2 cluster results in suppression of tumour suppressor (Cdkn1c) and over expression of growth promoter (Igf2). Loss of imprinting leads to uncontrolled growth which is a hallmark of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation on tumour suppressor gene induces gene silencing and promotes tumorigenesis. Decitabine (2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine) is a pro-drug that inhibits DNA methylation on tumour suppressor genes. It belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor which plays an important role in reverting hypermethylation on tumour suppressor gene. <br /><br />Decitabine exerts anti-tumour  property by inhibiting genomic
 cytosine methylation thereby restoring proliferation control and 
apoptosis sensitivity on tumour suppressor gene.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation during sensitive periods establishes epigenetic marks which are mitotically heritable. It occurs at cytosine–guanine (CpG) dinucleotides and is associated with gene silencing, genomic stability and integrity at promoter and intergenic regions and repetitive elements, respectively. DNA methylation alters gene expression and cellular function and provide critical layers of gene regulatory control.

<br /><br />A sensitive period refers to the time during early life when there is an increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms, e.g., when changes in environment have the greatest influence on epigenetic makeup. Two sensitive periods: (a) during primordial germ cell development, and (b) early embryonic development are the time during which epigenome is most vulnerable to environmental insults due to extensive epigenetic reprogramming (clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks).

<br /><br />Due to extensive epigenetic reprogramming, treating patients during the aforementioned sensitive periods can disturb genomic stability and integrity resulting in shifting the establishment of epigenetic marks, which could have trans-generational ramification.<br /><br />Reference:<br /><br /><span>Bird, A.
