    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl residue to a cytosine preceding a guanine (CpG). CpG-islands are regions of the DNA which are rich on CpG's. Normally the CpG islands are hypomethylated through out the genome. The CpG island are often located in the promoter region of the genes. Under normal circumstances the CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes are unmethylated making the the chromatin structure less compact (euro-chromatin) which makes transcription  and activation of the gene possible. In cancer locus-specific hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes takes place frequently (it is mitotically heritable), Hypermethylation of CpG islands makes the chromatin structure more compact (hetero-chromatin), which leads to gene inactivation/silencing. Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes is a fundamental part of the development of cancer.Hypermethylation of tumor supressor genes is often more frequent than somatic mutations and as cancer progresses CpG islands hypermethylation increases.<br />Under normal circumstances the CpG's in the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements (genome wide) are hypermethylated. Hypermethylation of these regions causes the chromatin structure to be compact (heterochromatin) which leads to genomic stability. In cancer the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated (genome-wide hypomethylation) which leads to genomic instability which can cause somatic mutations (deletions,reciprocal translocatrions, insertions). This can occur because the DNA is not densely packed into hetero-chromatin.  Hypomethylation the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements seems to occur very early in the development of cancer and is a fundamental part of the development of cancer. Hypomethylation can also occur in CpG poor promoters (ex. oncogenes). When hypomethytion occurs in promoter regions of oncogenes this leads to gene activation (Activation of oncogenes).<br />DNA methylation is context dependent. Some tumors are primary driven by tumor suppressor hypermethylation, while other are primary driven by chromosomal instability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic alteration during the development of cancer causes deregulation of imprinted genes.DNA methylation is an important factor in imprinting, in contrast to other genes DNA methylation of imprinted genes not always correlated with gene silencing.<br />H19/Igf2 cluster is dependent on enhancer blocking.<br />Normally the imprint-control region is methylated on the paternal allele, resulting in paternal imprinting. CTCF can not bind to the imprint-control-region because of the methylation. The enhancers can therefore work directly on Igf2, resulting in gene expression of Igf2 and no expression of H19<br />Under normal circumstances is the imprint-control region unmethylated on the maternal allele. CTCF  can bind to the imprint-control-region, this blocks the enhancers effect on Igf2 and instead will the enhancers work at H19  which will be expressed only from the maternal allel while Igf2 will be inactived on the maternal allele.<br />Mutation, deletions or epigenetic disruption  can cause loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster (ex. uniparental disomy, or the maternal allele behaving like the paternal allele). Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (maternal transmission) which is caused by (disorder both in Kcnq1 and/or H19/Igf2) where loss of Cdkn1c (tumor suppressor ) and upregulation of Igf2 (oncogene) result in predispostion to childhood tumors ex Wilm's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic alterations are reversible, in contrast to genetic mutations. Because of the reversibility, the epigenetic alterations are potential therapeutic targets. Decitabine belongs to DNMTi (DNA methyltrasferase inhibitor), drugs that inhibit DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine is approved in the treatment (FDA-approved) of myelodysplastic syndrome progressed to AML. <br />Decitabine is a nuceloside analogue, it is incorporated into the DNA and there after binds irreversibly to DNMTs (DNA methyltransferase), resulting in DNMT not being able to add the methyl group to the daughter strand. DNMTi is there fore replication dependent, meaning that the cell has to devide (which cancer cells often do more than normal cells). <br />Decitabine have an anti-tumor effect by having the potential to reverse DNA-hypermethylation of tumor suppresorgenes by binding DNMTs, which results in the hypermethylation not being mitotically heritable. By reversing DNA promoter hypermethylation of inactived tumor suppresor genes results in activation of tumor suppresor genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs altering DNA methylation might lack specificity, which means they have effect not only on the cancer cells, but on all dividing cells (systematic) because DNA methylation is a part of normal physiological development (it is critical for all cell types). For eks. DNMTi might have an effect on all dividing cells.This might result in severe side effects.<br />Sensitive period is a period where epigenetic marks are being established (where the epigenetic marks are being cleared and reset).<br />Sensitive periods are in generel when the germ cells are developing and the period just after fertilization (during early embryonic development). There are later in life organ-specific-sensitive periods.<br />During the sensitive periods the patients treated with DNA methylation drugs have the highest risk for long term side effects because the DNA methylation drug can effect the establishment of DNA methylation which is crucial for normal cellular growth, differentiation, imprinting and x-incativation ect. Alteration in the "normal methylation" pattern might result in genomic instability due to global DNA hypomethylation (when treated with a DNMTi), silencing of important tumor supressor genes due to hypermethylation and loss of imprinting.</div>
