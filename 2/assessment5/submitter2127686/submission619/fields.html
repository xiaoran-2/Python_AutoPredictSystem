    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated. In cancer, the opposite is true: At specific loci, CpG island are heavily methylated which results in the silencing of tumor suppression genes. The lack of these tumor suppressors then allows for the rapid growth of cancerous tumors. 
<p>
In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are heavily methylated. In cancer, again the opposite is true: There is a genome-wide hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions. This lack of methylation allows for illegitimate recombinations of genes, and repeats may be activated and jump around the genome, affecting neighboring genes. The overall result of the loss of methylation in these elements is general genomic instability which promotes cancer. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements is found with all forms of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, the paternal allele at the Igf2 cluster is methylated which allows IgF2 to be expressed. The maternal allele is unmethylated which causes CTFC to bind its insulator elements, and this then prevents the enhancers from acting on Igf2 and prevents Igf2 expression for the maternal allele.
<p> In Wilm's tumor, there is a loss of imprinting which results in the maternal allele also being methylated and expressing Igf2. With both the paternal and the maternal allele expressing Igf2, the patient receives a double dose of the growth promoting Igf2 which leads to aberrant growth and cancer in the kidney.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, so it lowers the overall methylation of the DNA. Decibatine is currently approved for myelodysplastic syndrome which is characterized by heavy methylation of the CpG islands. Decibatine lowers the methylation of these CpG islands which can then allow the previously silenced tumor-suppressing genes to be expressed again.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, so it will maintained as cells divide. A sensitive period occurs when there is normal epigenetic reprogramming happening during development, for example in germ cells or during early embryonic development. During these periods, methylation markers are removed and re-established. Treating a patient with methylation inhibitors during this time might result in the methylation markers not being appropriately recreated, and lead to imprinting disorders. The methylation inhibitors might also disrupt maintained methylation of repetitive elements.</div>
