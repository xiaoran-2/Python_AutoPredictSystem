    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell CpG islands are generally
hypomethylated, which allow the expression of the gene. However, in a cancer
cell  CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated,
which then causes silencing of the underlying genes. In general the
hypermethylated CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumour suppressor
genes. When tumour suppressor genes are silenced, cell division becomes
unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer.</p>

<p>The genome in general is methylated in the intergenic
regions, introns and repetitive elements in a normal cell, but in cancer these
regions tend to be hypomethylated. One of the functions of DNA methylation is
to maintain genomic stability and  prevent
illegitimate recombination between repeats. If we have hypomethylated
intergenic regions and repetitive elements then  illegitimate recombination can occur <span>(deletions,
insertions, reciprocal translocations and duplications)</span> because
they are not densely packaged down into heterochromatin, also the repeats can
jump or have their promoters becoming active so we end up with genomic
instability and cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells imprinted genes are no longer
imprinted. They become either expressed from both parental alleles or silent
from both parental alleles.  Lots of
genes that are imprinted are involved either in growth
promoting or growth suppressing.  So, in
cancer, we can find hypermethylation or hypomethylation of imprint control regions , it depends on
the  function of the genes that are
found  within the control region.</p>

<p>In normal cells H19/Igf2  cluster is methylated on the paternal  allele, and it's unmethylated on the  maternal allele.  When it's unmethylated the H19 gene will be
expressed and the Igf2 gene will be silenced and when it’s methylated the H19
gene will be silenced and the Igf2 gene will be expressed. So, in a normal cell
we have a normal dose of H19 from maternal allele, and a normal dose of lgf2
from paternal allele.</p>

<p>Loss of imprinting of H19/ Igf2 gene results in
an hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele. So booth
alleles expresses lgf2 gene and none expresses H19 gene, so we have a double
dose of Igf2 as well as no dose of H19. </p>

<p>Loss of imprinting of the H19/Igf2 gene has
been identified in  Wilms tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor,
which are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.</p><p>Decitabine
stops the methylation process by eliminating a protein known as DNA
methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), an enzyme that adds methyl groups to DNA.</p>

<p>It is a nucleoside analogue and it is incorporated
into the DNA upon replication. When DNMT1 comes to bind that nucleotide to copy
the methylation to the daughter strand, DNMT1 is irreversibly bound and  it can no longer be released.  As a consequence, methylation marks become
lost during DNA replication.</p>

Decitabine 
interferes with the methylation of DNA. 
By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor
suppressor genes is restored and therefore
the control of cell growth.<p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have
lasting effects because DNA methylation is an epigenetic marc which is
mitotically heritable; it passes on during cell division to daughter and
granddaughter cells until it is actively erased. </p>

<p>Because of those lasting effects we have to
avoid treating patients with such drugs during sensitive periods, when epigenetic
reprograming takes place. We have two phases of epigenetic reprogramming.  The first one is during preimplantation development,
and the second one is during primordial germ cell development.</p>

<p>When a baby is in the utero at mid gestation
it's developing the primordial germ cells for the next generation.  So, if a pregnant mother takes a drug, which
could influence epigenetic control, not only she and her baby are exposed, but
also the next generation because the primordial germ cells in the baby are exposed
too.</p></div>
