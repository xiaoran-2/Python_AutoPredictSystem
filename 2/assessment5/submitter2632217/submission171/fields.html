    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands normally functions to silence a gene and in a normal cell, genes needed for the cell functions would not be methylated. However, in a cancerous cell the CpG islands are often methylated and therefore silencing genes. This can cause disruption for example if a gene in a normal cell like a tumor suppressor should be unmethylated and turned on but in a cancerous cell, it is methylated. The tumor suppressor gene is turned off. Allowing for potential overgrowth. <br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements of DNA are normally methylated and effectively silenced. But in cancer cells, these areas tend to be hypomethylated (they have reduced methylation). Depending on the location of those areas will effect how the hypomethylation disrupts DNA and ulitmately lead to genomic instability. The instability comes may come by an increase in repeats and transposons since they are no longer kept in check by methylation, or by activation of hidden genes normally methylated to prevent it from activation. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region of the paternal allele in a normal cell is usually methylated, that prevents CTFC binding and enhancers are then able to act on the lgf2 gene allowing for its expression. The imprint control region of the maternal allele in a normal cell is usually unmethylated allowing the CTFC to be binded and enhancers can act on the H19 and NOT on the lgf2 gene.  When proper imprinting is disrupted, increased methylation can occur meaning that both imprint control regions become methylated and act as if both are paternal alleles. Both are activating the lgf2 expression which is an increase is the genes dosage. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of epigentic inhibitors that help demethylation of DNA, DMNTi. These are very small molecules that can attach themselves to specific parts epigenetic machinary (enzymes) to inhibit/prevent methylation from happening. Because cancer cells reproduce at a higher rate than normal cells, small quantities of Decitabine seems to be effective inhibiting just enough of DNA methylation to stop the tumour cell from growing without causing additional adverse side effects on the surrounding normal cells. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome because they are mitoticaly heritable, meaning that when the cell divides the same epigenetic marks he parent cell has will be the same as in the daughter cells. If a patient is taking a drug that changes the DNA methylation of cancerous cells, those cancerous cells that have altered epigenetic marks will pass on the altered marks even when the patient in no longer taking the drug treatment. This is beneficial. However, it would not be good to have a pregnant patient take a drug treatment during sensitive periods which is a time when DNA methylation marks are removed. There are two sensitive periods, early preimplantation development where the maternal and paternal epigenomes are cleared to get ready for cell differentiation and primordial germ cell development where imprinting marks are removed and reset as well as the maternal and paternal epigenomes are cleared. Any drugs that disrupt the clearing of DNA methylation during those times could lead to a failure of the embryo to develop. <br /></div>
