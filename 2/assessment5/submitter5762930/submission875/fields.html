    <h1>Submission 875 from Anon (session_user_id: f39998a2670c56c8109f7dde0f39589f5527972f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA
methylation is an epigenetic
modification
and is important for gene regulation and
development. This epigenetic
change turn a gene on or off. DNA methylation can change the
expression of genes. This change is normally unidirectional and
permanent, blocking
a cell from converting into a different cell variety.
DNA methylation is usually
removed during zygote formation and re-established through successive
cell division during development. </span>

<p><span>The
methylation
can occur in early embryonic stem cells or cancer cells. Abnormal
patterns of DNA methylation influence in
disease processes, above all
in many human tumors.</span></p>
<p><span>During
genetic reprogramming there are two sensitive periods, they are
during germ cell development and early development. When
germ cells emerge they have their own epigenetic marks, this marks
are gradually lost (DNA methylation is globally erased) when the
cells migrate and proliferate.</span></p>
<p>During
the period of drug treatment, the pattern of DNA methylation is
changed in some genes avoiding tumour genes. It is known that DNA
methylation change during genetic reprogramming, so if drugs are
applied during this period, we are not going to achieve the pattern
of DNA methylation that we need to avoid human tumours.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In
the paternal allele there is methylation in the imprinting control
region (ICR). If this region is methylated, the protein CTCF can not bind to the ICR,
so enhancers are free to act to Igf2 and this gene will be
expressed.<br /><p><span>In the maternal allele there is unmethylation in the
imprinting control region. The protein CTCF binds with the imprinting
control region silencing Igf2 expression. The enhancers act to H19
instead of with Igf2 and this long non coding RNA is expressed. <br /><br />In
Wilm's tumour there is a loss of imprinting and the maternal allele
is hypermethylated. Now the maternal allele is like the paternal
allele and both of them are expressed. With imprinting there are two
alleles which are expressed so we have a double doses of the Igf2
gene. <br /></span></p><p>This
gene is related with growth. In Wilm's tumour the maternal allele is
expressed, so we have overexpression of this gene resulting in cancer
of the kidneys.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine
is a kind of drugs known as demethylating agents. It also belongs to
the cathegory called antimetabolites. DNA methylation is one of the
most important mechanism that regulates gene expression in cells. 

<p>There
are some suppressor genes that regulate cell division and growth.
When these genes are unmethylated can regulate their function.
However, when suppressor genes are methylated, there is an
unregulation in the cell division promoting cancer because these
genes are blocked.</p>
<p>Decitabine
hypomethylated DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine
binds to the enzymes that catalyse the methylation reaction. This
result in the expression of the previously hypermethylated silenced
genes.</p>
<p>With
this process of demethylation, the function of tumour suppressor
genes are restored and cell division is regulated. Because of that,
Decitabine is used like anti-tumour effect due to their restore
regulation in their suppresor gene.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>CpG
islands are important because they are often promoters of genes. CpG
islands tend to be protected for
methylation, so if these islands are methylated we have silencing of
gene expression. DNA methylation
of CpG islands is
the addition of a methyl (CH3) group at the carbon 5 position of the
cytosine ring. DNA methylation is brought about by a group of enzymes
known as the DNA methyltransferases (DNMT).</span>
<p><span>This
methyl group prevent to some
enzymes to bind, so
we have silencing of genes.
Nowadays, it is known that CpG islands methylated is more to maintain
the silencing expression than to start the silence.<br />In
cancer we have a global change in DNA methylation that means genomic
instability. </span><br /><span>CpG
islands are normally methylated in cancer. </span>Hypermethylation results in loss of expression of a variety
of genes critical in the development of some kind of cancer.
</p>
<p><span>CpG
island are normally unmethylated, but intergenic regions and
repetitive elements are methylated. The methylation in repetitive
elements maintain genomic integrity. However, this is not clear in
intergenic regions. In both regions,  methylation avoid
transcriptional interference.<br /></span>In
cancer these two regions are unmethylated so this give to he whole
genome hypomethylation. This global hypomethylation has also been
recognized as a cause of oncogenesis. In addition, this causes
transcriptional activation and has been found in many types of
cancer.</p>
