    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are regions with a high density of CpG sites in the genome, often found in the promoters of genes.  Normally, they are unmethylated, allowing the normal expression of their genes.  However, in cancer, CpG sites are often hypermethylated.  This leads to the silencing of the genes which the CpG islands are in the promoters of.  This can contribute to cancer if the silenced genes are tumor suppression genes.  Examples of silenced genes in cancer include RB in retinoblastoma and BRCA1 in breast cancer.<br />Cancer also causes hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  Normally, these are methylated.  This prevents recombination between repeats on different chromosomes, transposition of repetitive elements, and expression of genes due to cryptic promoters.  In cancer, the methylation is reduced, leading to these incidents of genomic instability that contribute to cancer.  In some cancer, CpG poor promoters can also be hypomethylated, leading to the expression of genes that promote cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The disruption of imprinting in cancer can often lead to the over-expression of oncogenes, and the suppression of tumour suppression genes. An example of this is the H19/Igf2 cluster.  In the normal paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated, preventing an insulator protein, CTCF, from binding.  This causes enhancers downstream on the genome to activate the expression of igf2, a proto-oncogene.  In the normal maternal allele, the imprint control region is unmethylated, allowing the insulator protein, CTCF to bind.  This blocks the expression of the igf2.  In Wiln's tumour, the imprint control region is methylated on both the maternal and paternal alleles, leading to the expression of igf2 by both.  This overexpression of igf2 leads to excessive growth by the cell.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  It prevents replicating DNA from being methylated by DNMT.  This can have an anti-tumour effect if cancer causes the hypermethylation of tumour suppression gene promoters.  In this case, Decitabine will prevent this hypermethylation, allowing the genes to be expressed.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable by all daughter cells.  Thus, if a drug causes hypo or hyper- methylation, that will persist for all daughter cells.  This may have detrimental effects later in life. In a sensitive period, old epigenetic marks are being removed and the new epigenetic marks are being established.  The two sensitive periods of development are early development of the embryo and primordial germ cell development.  Treating patients during these periods could disrupt the laying of initial epigenetic marks, leading to a variety of developmental problems later on. </div>
