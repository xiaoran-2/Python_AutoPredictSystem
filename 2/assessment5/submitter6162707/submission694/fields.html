    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation involves the addition of methyl groups,
consisting of one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms to DNA molecules, to cytosines
in particular where they are followed by guanines.</p>

<p>CpG islands are stretches of DNA which have higher
percentage of cytosine-guanine.  They are
usually hypomethylated and cluster at the promoters of DNA genes and at the sites
of transcription initiation.    </p>

<p>CpG islands work by condensing the chromatin.  They are bound by binding proteins Mcp1 and
Mcp2 which have a transcription repression domain which will silence gene
expression.  CpG islands are often
situated in clusters with repetitive and intergenic regions and these will be
silenced to maintain the genomic integrity of the genome.  In normal circumstances the repetitive and
intergenic regions are hypermethylated.</p>

<p>In a cancer cell the CpG islands are likely to be
hypermethylated. This can lead to cancer suppressor genes being silenced and
these control cell life cycle, apoptosis and cell repair.  It also means the repetitive and intergenic
regions may become active and could have deletions, insertions and reciprocal
translocations inserted as well as illegitimate recombination of repeats.  If there are many occasions when a gene is shut
down, or repeats incorrectly expressed, the cell may stop dying and continue
growing causing a tumour, and as tumours continue growing they accumulate more
DNA methylation.  </p>

<p>If CpG islands become hypermethylated it will affect the CpG
island shores - that is the areas surround CpG islands, and this too will
effect gene expression.</p>

<p>Altogether there are many different layers of DNA
methylation which can influence each other, and disruption or mutations can
lead to a genome wide reduction of methylation, while regionally it may
increase.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster is on human chromosome 11 and is controlled
by enhancer blocking.</p>

<p>It is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on
the paternal allele, as the methylation imprint is on the paternal side.</p>

<p>The unmethylated region is bound by a protein called CTCF
which is an insulator protein.  This
insulates the Igf2 gene from the downstream enhancers.  It is called chromatin looping because the
preferred loop is when the enhancers act upon Igf2, but with the presence of
CTCF they are forced to act on the H19 RNA nearby instead, creating a secondary
loop.  In contrast, on the paternal
allele there is methylation so CTCF cannot bind.  This means the enhancers are free to work on
the IGf2 gene.  Consequently Igf2 is
expressed only on the paternal allele, not the maternal allele.</p>

<span>In some cancers the maternal allele reverses, and
expresses itself as a paternally. This means that the Igf2 will be expressed
twice and increases the amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 the cells
produce.  This may stimulate the growth
of tumour cells and stops damaged cells being destroyed.  Wilms disease is an example of this, it is a
rare kidney cancer present in children.  </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor which acts
as a hypomethylating agent.  In cancer
cells CpG islands become hypermethylated, corrupting genomic instability and
silencing tumour suppressing genes.  Then
hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repeats can activate otherwise silent
genes or cause illegitimate recombination of repeats.</p>

<span>DNA methyltransferase is an enzyme that modulates gene
expression during cell division. It recognises hemi-methylated DNA and restores
methylation to both strands. By targeting DNMT1 with Decitabine, methylation
marks will not be copied over to the daughter strands, and as cancer cells
divides more rapidly than ordinary cells they will be affected most.  At the moment Decitabine is most effective
against myelodysplastic syndrome and is used in very small doses. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so once marks are
set they are copied during cell division and can endure for the lifetime of the
individual.  Methylation is laid down by methyltransferases,
enzymes that recognise hemi-methylated DNA and restores methylation to the
daughter strand.  If drugs can alter DNA
methylation then the new marks will continue to be copied by
methyltransferases.</p>

<p>There are certain sensitive periods during development of
animals when epigenetic marks have to be cleared to restore totipotency and
then re-set afterwards.  This primarly
affects the next generation or the one after that.  One time is in the primordial germ cell stage,
when epigenetic marks are reset.  Also in
the blastocyst in early pregnancy and in the gametes just before
conception.  There are other vulnerable
times during childhood and approaching puberty during the slow growth periond,
particularly 9-12 years in males and 8-10 years in females.</p>

<span>Treating patients during these periods would be
inadvisable because epigenetic marks are at their most vulnerable point when
they are being reset, and they are more susceptible to being changed or
corrupted at this time. </span></div>
