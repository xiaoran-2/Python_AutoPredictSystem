    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands results in  hypomethylated CpG islands, so typically
methylation is not observed at CpG islands. However,  in general the gene is methylated
at the repetitive element, intergenic region and even in the introns of the
gene.</span></p>

<p>Conversely in
a cancer cell, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than in a
normal cell and the rest of the genome in general, including the repetitive elements,
intergenic regions and the gene itself (introns) are unmethylated.</p>

<p><span>Disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer by causing CpG
hypermethylation.  This typically occurs
in the promotors of tumour suppressor genes and results in epigenetic silencing
of the suppressor gene due to it being mitotically heritable. Alterations in
DNA methylation can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes
and over-expression of growth promoting genes. </span></p>

<p>The normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to
maintain genomic stability by ensuring that genetically the genome was normal
and chromosomes were not lost or gained or have illegitimate combination
between chromosomes.</p>

<p>However, in
cancer these intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated
resulting in illegitimate recombination between repeats, leading to recipricol
translocations between chromosomes. In a normal cell this would not happen as
the repeats would be heavily methylated and heterochromatinised. However in
cancer cells these regions are hypomethylated, they mis-align and an illegitimate
recombination can occur because they are not densely packaged down into
heterochromatin. The repeats can also be activated because of the
hypomethylation, meaning they have the ability to make a copy of themselves and
jump around the genome or transpose, resulting in activation of cryptic promoters
and disruption of neighbouring genes. This can result in additional deletions
or insertions within the chromosomes.</p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal
cells, the imprint control region (ICR) on the paternal allele is methylated. Because
the paternal allele is methylated, the enhancers can act on Igf2 because CTCF
is not binding to insulate this, and consequently Igf2 is expressed.</p>

<p>In normal
cells, the ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated. When unmethylated, the
CTCF will bind this insulator element and as a result the enhancers will act on
H19, but Igf2 will be silent and consequently Igf2 is not expressed.</p>

<p><span>With loss of
imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster in Wilm’s tumour, hypermethylation of the
ICR on the maternal allele occurs as well. 
Consequently you now also have expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele
resulting in double the amount of Igf2 in comparison to what you have in a
normal cell. Igf2 is growth promoting and is associated with Wilm’s tumour,
where Igf2 is over-expressed.</span></p>

<p><span>Alterations
in DNA methylation at ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth
restricting genes and over-expression of growth promoting genes.  They are often an early event seen in the
pre-neoplastic tissue.</span></p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is
a DNMTi (DNA Methyl Transferase Inhibitor), meaning it is a DNA demethylating
agent. It targets enzymatic epigenetic regulators, since enzymes are most
readily targeted with small molecule inhibitors.</p>

<p>Decitabine is
a neucleoside analogue that gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication,
resulting in the transferase being irreversibly bound and no longer able to be
released. This means the action of these DNMTi’s inhibitors is division
dependent and so requires a cell to be replicating. Consequently cancer cells
that are typically dividing more rapidly than most other cells in the body will
be more severely effected because they are replicating more.</p>

<p>Decitabine
can have an anti-tumour effect by being used at greatly reduced doses, generating
a good anti-neoplastic effect owing to them causing DNA demethylation.</p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Unlike other
forms of gene regulation, epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division
to daughter and grand-daughter cells until they are actively erased. However,
once erased they do not return. 
Consequently, it is possible that epigenetic therapies can effect
changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</span></p>

<p><span>A sensitive period relates to a time of active
remodelling of the epigenome, namely epigenetic reprogramming. During such
periods, there is increases sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic
mechanisms.  </span></p>

<p><span>The two main periods
sensitive to epigenetic control are firstly the period of primordial germ cell
development through to the production of mature egg or sperm (gametes) and secondly
the pre-implantation and early post implantation period.  There will also be brief periods in time when
specific organs will each have a sensitive period.</span></p>

<p>Treating
patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because alterations or
removal of the normal reprogramming process result in epigenetic abnormalities,
particularly aberrant imprinting.</p><span>
