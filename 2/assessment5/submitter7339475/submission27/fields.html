    <div class="field-value">CpG island methylation plays an important role in epigenetic gene control during mammalian development and is frequently altered in disease situations such as cancer. The majority of CpG islands is normally unmethylated, but a sizeable fraction is prone to become methylated in various cell types and pathological situations. DNA methylation is an enzyme-induced chemical modification to the DNA structure. A methyl (−CH3<span>) group is covalently bonded to the 5-carbon on the cytosine base. This process is mediated by one or more of a group of enzymes known as DNA methyltransferases. The methyl group is provided by S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), and this is converted to S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) in the process<br /><br /></span>Recent advances and significant ongoing research efforts aimed at characterizing the epigenome and its regulation place us firmly in an epigenetic era after the genetic era that culminated in sequencing of the human genome. The term “epigenetics,” which literally means “outside conventional genetics,” refers to the study of heritable changes in gene expression that occur independent of changes in primary DNA sequence. Epigenetic modifications are essential for mammalian development and cell proliferation, but they become disrupted in mature mammals, either by random factors or environmental influences.<span>Disruption of epigenetic processes results in altered transcriptional states that can culminate in malignant cellular transformation. <br /><br /></span>Recent advances in our understanding of cancer-associated DNA methylation underlie many promising clinical applications including the development of molecular markers for early detection of cancer, prediction of prognosis, and prediction of treatment outcomes. The ability of methylation markers to detect cancers has been evaluated in multiple bodily fluids including sputum, plasma, stool, urine, and nipple aspirates . DNA damage is considered to be the primary underlying cause of cancer.<span>If DNA repair is deficient, damage tends to accumulate in DNA</span><br /></div>

Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold.   One way that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growt. possible side effect</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>low platelet count </li><li>low white blood cell</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:

    <div class="field-value">Adverse early life events can induce long-lasting changes in physiology and behavior. We found that early-life stress (ELS) in mice caused enduring hypersecretion of corticosterone and alterations in passive stress coping and memory. This phenotype was accompanied by a persistent increase in arginine vasopressin (AVP) expression in neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and was reversed by an AVP receptor antagonist. Altered <i>Avp</i><span> expression was associated with sustained DNA hypomethylation of an important regulatory region that resisted age-related drifts in methylation and centered on those CpG residues that serve as DNA-binding sites for the methyl CpG–binding protein 2 (MeCP2). We found that neuronal activity controlled the ability of MeCP2 to regulate activity-dependent transcription of the</span><i>Avp</i><span> gene and induced epigenetic marking. Thus, ELS can dynamically control DNA methylation in postmitotic neurons to generate stable changes in </span><i>Avp</i><span> expression that trigger neuroendocrine and behavioral alterations that are frequent features in depression.<br /></span>investigation of the genetic effect of the BPA in the brain has been very limited and has not explored whether environmentally relevant dose of BPA could induced enduring effect on brain epigenome. in addition dose and sex dependent effect of BPA have not been thoroughly examined. </div>
