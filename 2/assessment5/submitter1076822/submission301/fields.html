    <div class="field-value">In general, <strong>DNA methylation at CpG islands</strong> correlates with silencing of underlying genes (less accesible for transcription factors) whereas the unmethylation of CpG islands correlates with active underlying genes (transcription factors can interact with them). So CpG islands tend to escape from methylation in normal conditions. <br />In cancer there is an alteration of DNA methylation in CpG islands, being CpG islands more methylated as tumor progresses. This is due an alteration in the epigenetic modifiers due to mutations, or it can be due to other causes such as abnormal nucleus architecture which causes silencing in a large group of genes (known as LRES). The hypermethylation of CpG islands tend to affect the tumor suppressors genes, so they are silenced and there is no control of growth (one hallmark of cancer).<br /><br />On the other hand, in normal conditions the DNA on <strong>intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong> tend to be methylated, avoiding the recombination, translocations and activation of other genes through some criptic promoters.<br />In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated (it takes place in early stages and progresses with time). It can be due to alterations in the epigenetic modifiers due mutations, due to abnormal nucleus arquitecture which causes activation of large groups of genes (known as LREA), and also due to dysregulation of noncoding RNAs (piRNAs and lncRNAs).<br />So the activation of these regions causes genomic instability: recombination between repeats, translocations which can disrupt important genes (such as tumor supressors genes), activation of criptic promoters which can activate the transcription of neighbouring genes such as oncogenes, and other disruptions (amplifications, deletions ... which causes in some genes, for example genes of epigenetic modifers, to gain or los function).<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal conditions in the <strong>maternal allele</strong>, there is an insulator element, the CTCF, which binds the imprinting control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster. This interaction does not allow the enhancers to promote Igf2 transcription (CTCF is able to insulate Igf2 from the downstream elements) and instead, they are free to promote H19 expression. So, in the maternal allele the Igf2 is not expressed.<br />On the other side, in the <strong>paternal allele</strong> the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated, which avoids the interaction of CTCF with it. The fact that CTCF can not bind to ICR makes enhancers free to act at Igf2 and promote Igf2 expression. So, in the paternal allele there is expression of Igf2, but there is no expression of H19 due to heterochromatine spreading from ICR methylation.<br />In Wilm's tumour there is a methylation of ICRs of both paternal alleles (hypermethylation), due to epigenetic modifiers alterations. This causes an overexpression of Igf2, which is an oncogene, which is a promoter of growth. So it is involved in tumour growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs in the class of De Novo Metil Transferase Inhibitors (DNMTi). We have seen that in tumor pogression there is an increased methylation of CpG islands, which causes mostly the silencing of tumour suppressors genes. The impact of Decitabine administration is that it reduces DNA methylation, so, as a result, the hypermethylation is reduced and tumour suppressors genes are not silenced. So if tumor suppressors genes are active they can reduce the tumor progression (anti-tumoural effect).<br />It is important to highlight that lower doses have more good antineoplasic effects than high amounts of this drug. Also, something that has to be considered is the moment when the treatment is given.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">We know that DNA methylation is heritable and unlike mutations, the epimutations are reversible. So if an epigenetic drug is given, and for example its funcion is to reduce DNA methylation, the methylations that will be erased, won't be present in the daughters cells, because as said before, they are heritable. So if there is no methylation in the mother cell, it won't be on daughters cells. So in this way there is achieved an enduring effect on the epigenome.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a period when the epigenetic control can be altered by the "environment". The most sensitive periods that exists are found in the development (during reprogramming): during preimplantation development and during primordial germ cell development.<br /><br />Treating patients during these sensitive periods is not advisable because drugs can alter the epigenotipe and because epigenetic marks are heritable, not only the person who is under the treatment can be affected, but the future generations (if germ cells are affected).<br /></div>
