    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p><em></em><em></em>CpG islands are frequent within or near gene promoters. Methylation at CpG islands prevents the underlying gene from being expressed. In normal conditions most CpG islands are unmethylated.</p><p>In cancer DNA normal unmetylated state in CpG islands is reversed in certain genes, particularly in tumour supressor genes. These genes tend to avoid tumour development and growth. By methylation their expression is inactivated, making much easier for the tumour to grow and spread.</p><p>Unlike CpG islands in normal conditions intergenic regions and repetitive elements are mostly methylated, involving silence of these genomic areas. This phenomenon enables stability of the gene to keep genomic integrity and to protect the genome from transponsable elements. </p><p>In cancer this mechanism is disrupted. There areas result unmethylated, which gives rise to instability, disruption of integrity and invasion of transposable elements (inversions, deletions, traslocations). In this way, the gene may lose control of its own expression by excess or by defect. In both cases, the consequence can be uncontrolled cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is a phenomenon consisting of inactivation of a gene by methylation. Only one of the alleles of the gene suffers imprinting, either the paternal or the maternal one. In practice the non imprinted gene works as if unique.</p><p>The <i>H19/Igf2 </i>cluster is formed by the oncogene / growth factor <i>Igf2</i>, by <i>H19</i> and by enhancers downstream. Between <i>Igf2</i> and <i>H19</i> there is a binding site for CTCF, that corresponds to the imprinting control region (ICR). When the site is unmethylated, as in maternal allele, <i>H19</i> expression occurs and it is increased by the enhancers downstream. These enhancers do not reach <i>Igf2 </i>due to CTCF action. In the paternal allele the CTCF binding site is methylated. This methylation is spread to <i>H19 </i>which is silenced. In this case the enhancers downstream get to act on Igf2, resulting in overexpression of this oncogene.</p><p>In Wilms' tumour there is a hypermetilation of the ICR (CTCF binding site). CTFC is not to stop the enhancers downstream from acting on <i>Igf2</i>. As a consequence Igf2 is overexpressed, giving rise to kidney cell proliferation and Wilms' tumour.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that acts as DNA demethylating agent. It exerts its action by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases (DNMT). It seems that the development of some haematological tumours depends on the inactivation by CpG methylation of certain tumour supressor genes. Decitabine allegedly helps to actively enhance these genes function through DNMT inhibition.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Some epigenetic changes may last or even be transmitted through generations depending on when have occurred. In development there are some sensitive periods in which all epigenetic marks are removed. An enviromental influence in those periods may change the expected epigenomic charge of the individual. Just after fertilization both paternal (more rapidly) and maternal (more slowly) epigenetic marks are erased. They reappear during the phase of blastocyst. Somatic cells remain the same since, but primordial germ cells when start development lose again all epigenetic marks. These are the two sensitive periods. Treating patients during sensitive periods may interfere with the normal epigenetic development and give rise to major problems for the subject's future health.</div>
