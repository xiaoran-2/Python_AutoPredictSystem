    <div class="field-value"> Normal function of DNA methylation  at CpG island is to silence of gene expression( usually unmethylated)<br />In cancer cells  the CpG island are hypermethylated, and the repetitive elements and intergenic regions and even in the introns of genes are hypomethylated<br />DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation silencing the tumor supressor genes, mitotically heritable and epimutation are rapidly  selected but they are reversible :) Activation of oncogenes and silencing of the tumor supressor genes are both lead to cancer.<br />Normal function of DNA methylation in intergenetic regions and repetitive elements to maintain genomic integrity ( usually methylated) hypomethylation during cancer leads to copying errors such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the<div>chromosomes.</div>Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation:   at  repetitive regions , CpG poor promoters lead to cancer<br />Hypomethylation of repeats and/or intergenic intervals leads to genomic instability: i Illegitimate recombination between repeats<div>activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b></b>H19 contains a differentially methylated  (at its CpGs according to parental inheritance)  imprinting control region .The paternal
copy of H19 is methylated and silent while the maternal  is hypomethylated
or unmethylated and expressed in the offspring cell. The imprinting of the H19/Igf2 gene cluster is important in many different
cancers and syndromes that include growth-disorders In a cell around the H19/Igf2 locus we ordinarily see the methylation of the paternal allele at theICR, and no methylation for the maternal allele. The CTCF complex binds to the allele on the maternal strand and the downstream enhancers act on H19 as a result. The CTCF complex does not bind to the paternal allele due to the methyl marks, which leads to silencing of the H19 gene as the enhancers instead drive expression of Igf2. Thus, in a regular cell you observe a normal dose of both H19 from maternal strand, and Igf2 from paternal strand. However, when this ICR becomes hypermethylated, both strands appear to be of paternal origin and get<br />expressed as such. So, the system gets a double dose of (growthpromoting) Igf2 (as well as no dose of H19). (Wilm's tumour. )<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent, hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. This turns out to be particularly useful in treating myelodysplatic syndrome which is a precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia. In case of Decitabine, the antitumour effect has been linked to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor supressor genes, induced by the hypothemylation. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by dysregulated gene expression and abnormal patterns of DNA methylation . DNA hypermethylation might play a role in chemotherapy resistance, so  agents that reduce DNA methylation  sensitize cells to chemotherapy. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is a particularly attractive form of regulation to target in treatments because it</div><div>can be manipulated once, and enduring effects are ensured as the DNA methyltransferase</div><div>enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis ( mitotically heritable).But it could be harmful especially during critical periods when extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs (sensitive period). Especially  it is not recommanded to</div><div>prescribe these drugs to pregnant mothers (including a few months before conception)  ( <span>may cause fetal harm ) </span>as</div><div>a lot of reprogramming happens in early development as well as gametogenesis (both gender).</div></div>
