    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancerous cells are characterized by hypermethlyation of CpG islands and overall hypomethylation otherwise. This disrupted methylation contributes to various cancer features.  </p><p>Take CpG islands, which  exist in the promoter region of genes. In normal cells, in 
general, these are not methylated, and the genes are therefore expressed. Methylating the islands would silence the gene.</p><p>In cancer cells,
the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated compared to normal cells.</p>

<p><span>One of the concerns in cancer is the silencing of tumor
suppressor genes. Such silencing can happen either through genetic mutations of the gene, or by
hypermethylation of the CpG islands of the gene's promoter region;. Both these aberrations 
are mitotically heritable, that is, the cell's daughter cells will continue to
carry the genetic/ epigenetic aberration and the gene will be silenced in the
daughter cell the way it was in the parent cell.  </span></p>

<p> The methylation of the CpG islands in cancer means that tumor suppressor genes are silenced. So the cell lacks the ability that this gene would have given--it is not able to suppress a tumor that may get initiated because of other aberrations in the cell. The DNA methylation of the CpG islands, combined with other aberrations, can therefore make the cell cancerous. </p>

<p>Another cell region where methylation is affected in cancer is the repetitive elements and  intergenic regions. </p><p>
In normal cells, repetitive elements and  intergenic regions are methylated, which helps maintain genomic stability.
For example, large, identical tracts found in repeats could cause
problems, but because they are heavily methylated and heterochromatinized,
the cell does not have illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes, such as reciprocal
translocations.</p>

<p><span>In
cancer, repetitive elements and intergenic regions are
hypomethylated, leading to alignments and misalignments between repeated
tracts of genes and resulting in genomic instability such as insertions, deletions, and reciprocal translocations.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is on the human chromosome 11. The cluster includes (upstream to downstream)  the gene Igf2, the imprint control region (ICR), the gene H19, and enhancers. </p><p>In normal cases, the paternal gene is imprinted. That is, the ICR is methylated, and cannot bind to the insulator protein CTCF. Heterochromatin spreading (DNA methylation spreading) also results in methylation of the CpG islands of the H19 promoter downstream, silencing H19. As a result, enhancers downstream skip the H19 and access and activate Igf2</p><p>In the maternal cluster, the imprint control region is unmethylated and is bound by an insulator protein called CTCF. The CTCF binding insulates the Igf2 from downstream enhancers. The enhancers therefore are free to act on H19 which is expressed. </p><p>That is, a normal H19/Igf2 cluster expresses H19 from the maternal cluster and Igf2 from the paternal cluster. </p><p>In Wilm's tumour, the ICR of the maternal H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated. So both clusters express (Igf2), doubling the dose. Neither cluster express H19.</p><p>Igf2 is growth promoting, and as its dosage doubles, it results in Wilm's tumour (a childhood kidney tumour). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor (DNA methyltransferease inhibitor). It is also called a DNA-demethylating agent or hypomethylating agent). It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the 
precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia. </p>

<p><span>Decitabine
is a nucleoside analog that gets
incorporated into the DNA strand and irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferease during replication  such that the cell cannot copy the methylation to the daughter DNA strand. This disrupts maintenance methylation, including the methylation aberration that was causing cancer. Because cancer cells replicate
more often than normal cells, they are more affected by decitabine than normal cells. </span></p>

<p>One epigenetic aberration that contributes to cancer is hypermethylation in the promoter region CpG islands of tumor-suppressor genes, silencing them. The DNMT inhibition because of Decitabine means this 
hypermethylation is not passed on to daughter cells, and so the tumor suppressor gene is activated
again, having an anti-tumour effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically transmitted to daughter cells with the help of DNMT. Any epigenomic alteration affecting DNA methylation therefore reaches all subsequent daughter cells. So, if cell methylation changes because of some chance event, that changed methylation is maintained in subsequent mitosis and can be called "enduring".  </p><p>Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming: the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. This happens in pre-implantation period/ early development, with rapid and active demethylation of the paternal genome and passive demethylation of the maternal genome. It also happens in primordial germ cell development, with differential resetting in spermatogenesis compared to oogenesis, and erasure of maternal and paternal imprinting. Epigenetic reprogramming also occurs at cell differentiation that creates various cell types. </p><p>Understanding sensitive periods is important because drugs affecting the epigenetic machinery don't just affect cancerous cells; they affect the entire system. That is, they have the potential to affect all cells of the body, and lead to unfortunate side-effects in cells that were not intended to be the target. </p><p>Drugs that affect the epigenetic machinery should therefore be avoided at times of epigenetic reprogramming, like younger patients who are developing germ cells, as well as during sensitive periods of development. </p></div>
