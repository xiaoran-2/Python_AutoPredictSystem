    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, you generally do not see methylation in CpG islands. In a cancer cell, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated (i.e., hypermethylation). Hypermethylation of CpG islands contributes to cancer, since the hypermethylation often occurs in tumour suppressor genes. Methylation of the promotors of tumour suppressor genes will lead to decreased expression levels (i.e., silencing) of these suppresor genes and may therefore increase the development of tumours.  <br />This type of hypermethylation is also referred to as locus-specific hypermethylation.<br /><br />In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements show lower methylation levels (hypomethylation) compared to normal cells. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability, recombination between repeats, activation of repeats, and activation of cryptic promotors. Therefore, hypomethylation of these intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to cancer.  This type of hypomethylation is also referred to as genome-wide hypomethylation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer. An example is disruption of imprinting at the H19/lgf2 cluster. <br />In normal cells, the imprint control region is methylated at the paternal allele and the enhancers will act on IGF2, resulting in IGF2 expression at the paternal allele. At the maternal allele, the Imprint control region is unmethylated and the enhancers will act on H19 while IGF2 will be silenced. <br /><br />Wilm's tumour is associated with a loss of imprinting at the H19/IGF2 cluster. Loss of imprinting at the H19/IGF2 cluster leads to hypermethylation of the Imprint Control Region and IGF2 will be expressed from both the paternal and maternal allele. Therefore, the expression of IGF2 is doubled compared to a normal cell. While IGF2 is growth-promoting, this increases the risk of cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a drugs inhibiting DNA methyltransferases (DNMT inhibitor).  Decitabine binds to DNMT after DNMT was bound to DNA and therefore the methylation pattern can not be copied to the daughter strand when the DNA is replicated. As a result, DNA methylation patterns will not spread and overall, DNA methylation levels will decrease. Cancer cells, which divide more rapidly than normal cells, will be more severely affected than normal cells, resulting in an anti-tumour effect. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Patterns of DNA methylation are mitotically heritable which means that methylation patterns can spread to newly formed cells. Therefore, DNA methylation may have enduring effects on the epigenome. <br />A sensitive period is a period in which DNA methylation patterns are erased and restored. There are two sensitive periods: early embryonic development and germ cell formation. <br />During such a period, it is essential that DNA methylation patterns are erased and are then restored, so treating patients with epigenetic drugs during a sensitive period would disturb normal development.</span></div>
