    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands is of two types Locus wide hypermethylation and Genome wide Hypomethylation.In normal cells,the CpG islands are not methylated as they are Tumor suppressor gene promoter sites.Their activity is necessary for the health of cells.However in Cancer these CpG islands are methylated which leads to the permanent silencing of Tumor suppressor genes thus activating the oncogenes.There is usually hypermethylation of CpG islands leading to epimutations in genes like RB,MLH1,MGMT,BRCA1 etc,thus causing the respective cancers.In Cancer cells alternatively the repetittive elements,intergenic regions and some intronic regions get activated(i.e there is loss of methylation from these sites).These mistakes then get accumulated and there is continuous loss of expression of tumor suppressor genes giving the abnormal cells an edge over the healthy cells.This allows unlimited division of the cells with a hypermethylated or sometimes like in skin cancer hypomethylated expression of the <span>CpG islands and leads to Cancer.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster has the ICR in the middle. Igf2 gene is imprinted on the paternal allele and is silent on the maternal allele.On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and is bounded by an insulator protein CTCF.CTCF insulates the effect of the downstream enhancers on Igf2 and prevents expression of Igf2 and enhances expression of H19 gene on the maternal allele.On the contrary,on the paternal allele the ICR is methylated thus preventing binding of CTCF on the ICR  bringing about activity of Igf2 by the downstream enhancers.Thus there is no H19 gene expression on the Paternal allele.A preferred chromosome looping reaction between enhancer and Igf2 is developed.In Wilm's tumour wherein there is loss of Imprinting occurs,there is overexpression of Igf2,which is an oncogene and a growth promoter.Due to overexpression.there is overgrowth of cells hence leading to embryonic or childhood tumours in the kidney.Also Loss of Imprinting is a common characteristic of Cancer.In cancer,there are mutations or deletions leading to loss of Imprinting and hence both the alleles behave like paternal allele,this results in too much Igf2 and hence too much growth and this form of disruption of ICR leads to Cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent belonging to a class of drugs which revert the effect of methylation on CpG islands and other regions.This drug is also called an Epigenetic regulator.This is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes wherein certain blood cells lose their functionality.It hypomethylates the CpG islands thus inducing some tumor suppressor activity and hence reduces the growth of abnormal cells. This drug assocaites with the DNA backbone for methylation.This drug is supposedly known to act on the transcription machinery,blocking the cell differentiaton mechanism and hence stopping growth of cancerous cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and are passed on to the daughter cells.If abnormality is developed during the germ cell development or during early development they escape erasure and goes on to express in the next generations.These periods of erasure are called sensitive periods.The sensitive periods are periods during the development of a cell into somatic cells and germ cells where the existing marks,other than the imprinted marks are erased and new epigenetic marks are set.During the sensitive period,the DNA is stripped off the methylation and new marks are set.The two sensitive periods are Early development and Primary germ cell development period. During these periods treatment is inadvisable as any mistake during this period can have effects across generations due to mitotic heritability of epigenetic changes.<br />Effects beyond drug treatment might be because of establishment of certain alterations in the tumor cellular environment which get expressed later and are considered effective during chemotherapy.Might be some form of resistance in healthy cells against chemotherapeutic effect and only the cancer cells are killed.<br /></div>
