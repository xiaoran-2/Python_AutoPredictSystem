    <h1>Submission 358 from Anon (session_user_id: add22bfb4f7255b45e59799fd873d07ca5e46bf2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong><em>Decitabine</em></strong> is a <strong>methyltransferase inhibitor</strong> which is used to treat a malignancy of the blood- Myelodysplastic syndrome, that progresses to Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML).<br />The drug acts by inhibiting DNA Methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). It is a nucleotide analog that gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication, by copying the methylation into the daughter strand and binding the DNMT1 irreversibly to it.  Hence the drug acts when the cell is dividing and as cancer cells are dividing more rapidly that other cells they are affected more by the drug.  The drug, when used in low doses, causes demethylation and thus activates the tumour- suppression genes. . However its effect on normal cell division could be a matter of concern, as the drug acts on all cells, not just the tumour cells. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><b>CpG Islands</b><br />As a general rule in epigenetics, DNA methylation of promoter regions is inversely correlated to gene expression, ie higher the methylation, lower the expression of the gene.  The exception to this rule are CpG islands, found in about 60% of promoter regions. CpG islands have a high CpG density and are usually unmethylated,  irrespective of the active state of the underlying gene. <br />However, in cancer cells, promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, causing the silencing of the underlying gene, which may lead to  undesirable results- for example, the disabling of  regulatory elements like  the  tumour suppression function.  CIMP, which is the term for unusually high frequency of DNA methylation at CpG islands was first identified in colo-rectal cancer. Connected to factors such as patient age,gender and tumor location, CIMP can also be found in solid cancers like glioma or breast cancer.  Because the levels of methylation are linked to the progression of the tumour, CIMP levels may be used as biomarkers for tumour diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.<br /><br /><b>Other methylation</b><br /> In normal cells, methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements  is a mechanism to repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites , to silence repetitive elements and to inhibit antisense transcription. Such methylation also regulates gene expression profiles and chromatin compartmentalization.<br />In a cancer cell, these areas could be hypomethylated, resulting in the activation of those previously-silenced areas like oncogenes for example. Genome-wide hypomethylation could lead to unwanted insertions, deletions and translocations of DNA.  <br /> It is also found that certain cancers like colo-rectal cancer caused methylation of areas called CpG Island Shores,  approximately 2Kb regions surrounding CpG islands. <br /><br /><i>Cancer thus epigenetically alters cells both by hypermethylation and hypomethylation. </i><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Normal case:</strong> In a normal cell, in the H19/lgf2 cluster,  the Imprint Control Region (ICR)  is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. Because it is not methylated, the CTCF on the maternal allele will bind its insulator element and the enhancers will act on the H19 and silence the lgf2. However, because of methylation on the paternal allele, the CTCF cannot bind and the lgf2 is expressed. This is how imprinting functions in a normal cell. <br /><strong>Wilm's tumour:  </strong>In Wilm's tumour, there is a loss of imprinting, so the maternal allele is also methylated.  Which means that the lg2 is now expressed both in the paternal and maternal alleles resulting in a double dose of lgf2. As lgf2 is growth-promoting, it  leads to multiplication of tumour cells in Wilm's tumour. <br /><br />In general,  ICRs ensure that certain genes are expressed in mono-allelic parent-of-origin fashion. In cancer, imprinting marks are lost and hypermethylation could result in expression of alleles from both parents or silencing of alleles from both parents.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>Epigenetic changes</b> like altering DNA methylation get <b>passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells</b>- thus the effect lasts beyond the period of drug treatment.  Thus epigenetic drugs differ from other drugs that target other forms of gene regulation like transcription factors, whose effects are not so long-lasting. <br /><b>Sensitive periods</b> are stages of development when <b>epigenetic markers are erased and rewritten and imprinted</b>. These periods include <b>early development</b> starting from fertilization and again during <b>primordial germ cell development</b>. Therefore this includes couples who are planning a baby and children in their pre-pubescent years, typically early teens.<br />Studies have shown that  factors like diet, smoking and sunlight exposure  during these sensitive periods have multi-generational effects that are  probably passed  through epigenetic markers.  Hence, at these sensitive periods taking a drug that alters epigenetic machinery could be construed a <b>large insult to the cellular environment</b> and may result in grievous consequences to future generations. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
