    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often
found at the promoters of genes and in normal cells they tend to be protected
from DNA methylation making them hypomethylated. The other parts of the genome
such as the repetitive elements, intergenic regions and the introns tend to be
methylated. In cancerous cells CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated and the
genome is hypomethylated. When a cell becomes cancerous methylation increases
at these CpG islands and can lead to silencing of tumor suppressors. Since
DNA methylation is mitotically heritable it becomes an effective way to silence
as the cells are dividing. Also these epimutations are rapidly selected for
since the silencing allows a competitive advantage. These cancerous cells that
have silenced tumor suppressor genes are able to divide rapidly and not die as
frequently as a normal cell. Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic and
repetitive elements contributes to genomic instability that is found in cancer.
In a normal cell methylation maintains the stability of the genome, but lack of
methylation can cause illegitimate recombination of repeats. This can lead to
reciprocal translocation between chromosomes or can cause insertions and
deletions. Lack of methylation can also cause repeats to be activated and jump
into the genome causing activation of cryptic promoters and the disruption of
neighboring genes. The overall hypomethylation of the genome means chromosomes
are not densely packaged down into heterochromatin and can misalign.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The paternal allele
has DNA methylation at the ICR which blocks the binding of CTCF. Without this
insulator protein CTCF DNA methylation can spread to the H19 promoter to
silence its expression. This leads the enhancers to act on Igf2 and cause
expression of the Igf2 gene. In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated,
which means that it can bind CTCF. This insulates Igf2 from downstream
enhancers and the enhancers instead act on H19 to activate expression. In Wilm’s
tumor both the paternal and maternal ICR are methylated. This methylation
silences H19 in both alleles and means that there is double expression of Igf2.
Igf2 is growth promoting which causes kidney tumor. Often seen in
pre-neoplastic tissues, which mean it happens early on usually children.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, which irreversibly
binds DNMTs after they are incorporated into the DNA. They are replication
dependent which means they will more severely affect cancer cells which divide
more rapidly. DNA methylation is seen more when a lower dose is used. This DNA
methylation is seen to kill tumor cells. However the DNMTs lack specificity
which means that they can hit all dividing cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation can have enduring effects
on the epigenome because changes are passed on during cell division to daughter
and granddaughter cells. The primordial germ cell development and early
development are two sensitive periods of development. During these sensitive
periods epigenetic marks are being cleared and reset. Because so much change is
occurring during these periods they are more susceptible to influences from the
environment. A drug that inhibits epigenetic machinery would lead to not being
able to clear epigenetic marks during these sensitive periods. Treating
patients during these sensitive periods could have negative effects on the germ
cells which will be passed on to future generations. Since a lot of drugs are
not targeted to specific locations you can have deleterious effects occurring
in other places in the genome that are then passed on.to your children or
grandchildren.</span></p></div>
