    <h1>Submission 645 from Anon (session_user_id: c765f74154b6c0285292dcb796ca04ec922e9e53)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNAme is an early epimutation in carcinogenesis. If this process continues, produces other changes such as silencing of tumor suppressor and especially genomic instability, with the subsequent production of mutations, which may be genetic (e.g. chromosome) making them have a long lasting effect irreversible. Sensitive period is one where the cells are capable of being genetically modified epigenetically or genetically by external factors, such as environmental or drug administration. <br />The development has two sensitive periods: early development that starts in period of gametes and ends when the blastocyst is matured; and germ cell development starts in primordial germ cells and finishes in gametes mature (differs between men and women). Is important have this in mind, because chemotherapeutic drugs attack all cells, including normal cells and this has implications that can damage even more in sensitive periods especially in germ cell development.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is a drug that belong to the inhibitors of DNMT. Other drug of this family is azacitidine (commercial name is Vidaza).</div><div>Decitabine decreases the methylation of DNA. This is a physiological process that silences genes, where in cancer is pathologic.</div><div>The hypermethylation of CpG islands is a hallmark of poor prognosis to the patient with cancer: demethylation targets is against gene silencing, promoting expression of genes</div><div></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The CpG islands are unmethylated in a normal context. This islands are promoters genes of tumours suppressors, so that methylation is a epigenetic process that produces gene silencing and uncontrolled proliferation of cells. The molecular process is epimutation in a cell that have DNAme from mitosis, that is to say that the cell suffers multiple hits genetically (DNAme from mitosis) and epigenetically (epimutation) in agreement with Knudson's theory. In cancer, CpG islands are methylated in early stage. Methylated CpG have two effects: first, this process is associated to chromatin condensation, where join with MeCP2 and this has a transcriptional repression domain; second, methylated CpG prohibits the junction with the transcription factor, altering the genic expression.<br /></div><div>In normal context, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. In both functions that a defense system, maintaining the genomic stability. In cancer, demethylation occurs in early stage of tumorogenesis: could occur trough passive phenomenon or active. The passive is for dilution of DNA methylated  when DNMT1 is absent; active is for enzimatic way, where the molecular substratum are TET proteins. Considering ADNme in intergenic regions and repetitive elements maintains genomic stability, demethylation leads to genomic instability which may be a transposition, transcriptional interference or recombining repeats </div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Paternal allele is methylated at ICR impeding the junction with CTCF, producing epigenetic silence of this ICR and act of enhancers on Igf2 with your expression posterior. Conversely, the maternal allele H19 is unmethylated, producing the expression of this ICR and binding CTCF, and where enhancers works on H19, with the subsequent  silencing IGF2. At the molecular level what happens in Wilms tumor is the maternal allele is methylated, resulting in overexpression of Igf2 and the subsequent development of this kidney`s neoplastic. Knowing that IGF2 is a growth promoter can understand their neoplastic potential.<br /></div>
