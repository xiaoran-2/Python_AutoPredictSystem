    <div class="field-value">CpG islands have been known to occur in many promoter regions of actively transcribed genes, in their <b>unmethylated</b> state.  However, aberrant methylation of such active genes, for instance those that code for the expression of tumor suppression proteins, is believed to induce cancer biogenesis in combination with other events. A prime example to DNA methylation at CpG islands leading to tumorigenesis is the observation of <strong>CIMP</strong> first identified with patients afflicted with colorectal cancer.<br /><br />On the other hand, the intergenic regions including repetitive elements that typically fall outside the exons are found <b>methylated</b> <i>per se</i> (i.e. inactive) to maintain genomic stability via enforcing the <b>imprinting</b> mechanism maintained throughout the lifetime of the individual. When such regions become unmethylated (or exist hypomethylated from the time such epigenetic marks were laid during embryonic development), the activation of non coding RNAs, such as <strong>HOTAIR</strong>, a lncRNA has been shown to dually upregulate DNA methylation 
(specifically at the H3K27 locus) and demethylate (at H3K4me locus) to silence tumor suppressor genes and 
has been implicated in breast cancer cases.<br /><br />Other mechanisms studied include those that either directly or indirectly alter epigenetic marks (the expression of<strong> piRNA</strong>s from 'now active' transposons) and post transcriptional gene silencing through the miRNA mediated mechanism to silence the mature mRNA transcript which could code for a tumor suppressor protein.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The  differentially imprinted H19/Igf2 cluster is regulated by the imprint control region (ICR) in the paternal allele that is <b>methylated</b> and therefore freed from binding to the insulator protein CTCF2. The consequence to ICR methylation is the spreading of heterochromatin downstream to H19 locus, thereby preventing the transcription of H19 lncRNA. The enhancers located further downstream access the<b> Igf2 locus to enable transcription</b>.<br /><br /> In contrast, the <b>unmethylated</b> maternal ICR binds CTCF2 to facilitate access of enhancers to H19 and promote its expression. The maternal Igf2 region remains <b>inactive </b>however, due to looping between the H19 locus and enhancers downstream.<br /><br />The H19/Igf2 cluster (Igf2 expression promotes cellular growth; hence oncogenic) in combination with the Kcnq1 cluster (wherein cdkn1c promotes tumor suppression and is<b> active</b> in the maternal allele) are known to be regulated by a single ICR in chromosome 11. Any imbalance in the expression of parental genes leads to <strong>over expression of Igf2 with concomittant silencing of cdkn1c</strong> due to<strong> </strong>genetic and/or epigenetic mechanisms<strong> </strong>(including the expression of two paternal alleles in absence of the mother's or faulty epigenetic machinery) contribute to the development of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, characterized by over-growth and other complications (including Wilm's tumor in kidneys) during childhood.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA demethyl transferase inhibitors (DNMTi's) and approved by the FDA. They mimic nucleosides (aka nucleoside analogues) to be incorporated into the DNA of<strong> dividing cells</strong> (especially cancer cells) to subsequently irreversibly bind DNA demethyl transferases (such as DNMT1) thereby inhibit the activity. Decitabine seems to exert its activity in this manner.<br /><br />DNMTi's have been used conventionally in the treatment of hematological malignancies since DNA hypermethylation of (CpG islands in the) promoter regions in the tumor suppressor genes have been observed in such diseases. Though the effects of these compounds are not specific, they have demonstrated to inhibit demethylation at comparatively lower doses with fewer side effects.<br /><br />Combinatorial therapy involving treatment of malignancies with DNMTi's and (histone deacetylase inhibitors) HDACi's prior to the standard regiment with chemotherapy (at significantly lower dosage) is been investigated for improved treatment outcome.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">It is evident DNA methylation marks establish in the early embryonic stage and also during the development of primordial germ cells (epigentically 'sensitive' periods in the lifetime of the individual). Any alteration in the epigenetic machinery and target DNA at these time periods might result in changes in the epigenome that in turn could be transmitted to daughter cells (somatic or germ cells). <br /><br />Unchecked cell division, arising due to a combination of epigenetically  'repressed' tumor suppressor genes and 'activated' oncogenes, is a characteristic hallmark of cancer cells. When such methylation marks are tampered with (using DNMTi's for instance), it is plausible the aforementioned epigenetic combination might no longer be transmitted 'faithfully' to rapidly dividing daughter cells which in turn could lose (at least to an extent) their malignancy including their abilities to hyper-proliferate and/ or metastasize. This could very well be the reason some patients, as observed by Dr. Baylin, responded to chemotherapy in a better manner after treatment with azacitidine and a HDACi.<br /><br />The use of above drugs could potentially impact the individual, either during early gestation or pre-pubescent individuals, wherein the epigenetic marks form in somatic and germ cells respectively and hence not advisable (the sensitive periods).<br /></div>
