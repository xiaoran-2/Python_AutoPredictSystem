    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands are regions between 300-3000 bp in length, these are found approximately in 60% of the promoters in mammal genes. For these reason and in order to maintain adequate levels of gene expression, they are maintained free of methylation. However in cancer cells, CpG islands appear hypermethylated, this change in the methylation status, in the promoters of cancer cells, causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes, contributing   in the maintenance and growing of cancer cells. On the other hand, in normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are kept methylated, while in cancer cells these parts of the genome appear hypotmethylated, contributing with recombination and genomic instability in cancer cells.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br /> Imprinted genes are expressed in a monoallelic way normal cells, most of these genes are involved in growth or suppression . For example the imprinting control region (ICR) in the parental allele from the cluster H19/Igf2 is methylated, for this reason the enhancers can interact with  Igf2, producing the expression of Igf2 from  the paternal allele. on the other hand, ICR on the maternal allele in cluster H19/Igf2 is unmethylated for this reason the enhancers will act on H19 cluster preventing the expression of Igf2. However in Wilm's tumor, ICRs in  maternal and paternal alleles are methylated, producing double douse of Igf2, promoting excessive  the cell growth, as a consequence the tumor that is observed in these disease. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Based on the current knowledge in epigenetic and understanding how these epigenetic parameters are altered in cancer cells, researchers have focused on developing drugs that can alter epigenetic machinery , one of these drugs is Decitabine this enzimatic epigentic regulator  belongs to the group of DNA methyltrasferase inhibitors. This drug is cell division dependent having as a main target cancer cells that are dividing faster than normal cells. the mechanism of action of this drug is producing hypomethylation. once incorporated as a nucleoside into the DNA strand in bind DNMTs blocking  its action in a irreversible way. Its effect has been proved in myelodysplastic syndrome, one possible mechanism is hypomethylating CpG Islands. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">the use of this drugs in high doses produce high side effects because it affects the epigenetic machinery in normal cells. , however when is used in lower concentration it can be useful against  cancer.  special considerations must be taken when this drugs are used in young patients because they can affect the imprinting genes in germ cells.<br /></div>
