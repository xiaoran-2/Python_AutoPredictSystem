    <h1>Submission 299 from Anon (session_user_id: bbe0b90124fb064e2af82869400c1e143af6eeac)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents and it is sold by Japanese company. <br />Decitabine, as DNA-demethylase, remove methyl group from DNA itself and DNA assossiated proteins which support DNA in chromosomes.<br />Demethylation of some tumour suppresor genes may have an anti-tumour effect, because tumor suppresor genes are involved in inducing deatht of "not normal" cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands is related to gene silencing. In normal cell CpG islands are hypomethylated. In tumor cell these islands are hypermethylated and are offen found in promotors of tumor suppresor genes. In this way cancer cell inactivate tumor suppresor genes. This is a good way of inactivating these genes because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.<br />Intragenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in normal cell and hypomethylated in cancer cell. Hypermethylation in these regions contribute to genomic stability. Hypomethylation in these regions is related to genomic instability (illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and trasposition,  activation of criptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes). </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Paternal allele is hypermethylated on H19 gene and in this way enhancers can act on the expression of Igf2 gene. Igf2 gene is normaly expressed from the paternal allele. DNA methylation on imprint control region (ICR) blocks binding of CTCF (insulator protein).<br />Maternal allele is not methylated on H19 gene so there is no expression of Igf2 gene from the maternal allele because CTCF is binding imprint control region. <br />Igf2 is an oncogene (growth promoting).<br />Hapermethylation of ICR on the maternal allele is reason for Wilms tumour, because there is too much expression of Igf2 which promotes growth of the cell.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic changes are mithoticly heritable. This changes are passed on during cell division to dauther and granddauther cells until this marks are actively removed. In this way drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.<br />Sensitive period are periods of active removing of histone marks, and this happens in premordial germ cell development ad in early stages of gastrulation. <br />Drugs that alter DNA methylation are not advisible during sensitive periods because these marks would be activelly removed.</div>
