    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is altered in cancer in two ways: hypermethylation, which takes place at CpG islands and islands shores, and hypomethylation, which takes place genome wide.<br />CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation in healthy cells. In cancer we find methylation of CpG islands in promoters of tumor supresor genes. If the CpG islands are unmethylated the tumor supresing genes are expressed. Methylation is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure which silences the expression of the gene. In cancer, methylation blocks the expression and is one of the factors impacting DNA and which leads to the development of cancer. In this way the action of the methylation is equivalent to that of a mutation which would also block the expression of the tumor supresor gene. The same is true of the CpG shores, which also  block the expression of tumor supresing genes. <br />On the other hand, hypomethylation, comes in two flavors. When it is repeats or intergenic regions that are hypomethylated, the effect is genome instability, which results in insertions, deletions or translocations. On the other hand, it can also take place in CpG poor promoters. In this case we are referring to poor promoters of oncogenes. Hypomethylation thus results in expression of these oncogenes, which are again one of the modifications leading to the development of cancer</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As a general rule, in cancer we find overexpression of oncogenes and silencing of tumor supresors. This can be achieved by genetics of epigenetics. This also applies to imprinting. In the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster, is is the paternal allele which is methylated in its imprint-control region (ICR), which extends to the promoters of H19, thus blocking its expression. In the maternal allele, H19 is expressed, and the ICR is unmethylated and is bound to CTCF. This protein blocks Igf2 from the enhancers, thus limiting its expression. The point here is that Igf2 can be considered as an oncogene, since it promotes growth, as can be seen in Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome.<br />So, in a normal situation Igf2 expression is only enhanced in the paternal allele. In Wilm´s tumor, the ICR of the maternal allele is also methylated. This means that H19 is not expressed and that there is no CTCF bound to the ICR, thus resulting in enhancers accessing both the maternal and paternal alleles. Thus there is an overexpression of Igf2, which leads to overgrowth and cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMT inhibitor). Its effect is achieved by blocking methylation of DNA. The compound binds in an irreversible manner to the DNMT when it is bound to DNA, thus exerting its effect when the cell is dividing. Decitabine is not specific, so it would block methylation at any site of the DNA. However, clinical trials have shown very good results and in fact the compound is approved for hematological malignancies and DNMT inhibitors are being tried for solid tumors as well. Taking into account the general rule for cancer stated in the previous question, the hypothesis in this case is that decitabine blocks hypermetylation of tumor supressing genes, on which these types of malignancies depend. The hypermethylation silences the expression of these genes. Blocking the methylation would allow the cell to express them again, thus restoring normal cellular control in these cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The concept of mitotic heritability is at the heart of epigenetics. When the cell divides, the methylation state of the progenitor cell is inherited by the daughter cells. Thus, drugs, or environmental or dietary factors, that have an effect on the methylation state, will have an enduring effect in the organism. In the case of DNA this is carried out by the enzime DNMT1, which is the maintenance DNA methyl transferase. In this particular case the most probable explanation to the effect s that DNMTs are blocking the methylation of genes that code for proteins that allow the cell to be sensitive to chemotherapy.<br />The very fact of mitotic heritability means that we have to be very careful with modifications of this epigenetic mark. This is specially so in the so-called sensitive period, those when epigenetic marks are being set up. In mammals, those sensitive periods are early development (from conception to the epiblast) and primordial germ cell development. Giving these drugs to young people, who are developing their primordial germ cells, or to pregnant women would have an effect on the establishment of the epigenetic marks that would be maintained and could have detrimental effects later in life<br /></div>
