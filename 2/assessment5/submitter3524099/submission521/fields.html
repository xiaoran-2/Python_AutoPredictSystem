    <h1>Submission 521 from Anon (session_user_id: 91db7ed34b5254e146c74c8c397ea134093d6936)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal tissue the CpG islands are unmethylated. When a normal cell becomes into a tumoral cell we can see that the CpG islands are methylated.<br />The methylation of CpG islands activate oncogenes and the demethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements inhibit tumour suppresor genes. <br />This tissue suffers hyperplasia, then neoplasia and finally occurss the invasion. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes. This is common, early event, often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue.<br />We can see this for example in the hypermethylation of ICR, Igf2 overexpression in Wilm´s tumour.<br />In a normal cell the paternal allele is methylated, in contrast the maternal allele is unmethylated. When it's
unmethylated CTCF binds its insulator element, and it means that the enhancers in this case will act on H19. <br />

 In a tumour cell both alleles are methylated, the maternal allele will be silence, so we don´t see expression; this produce loss of imprinting. so now you have a docuble dose of Igf2, and Igf2 is a growth promorting associated with Wilm´s tumour.  This events might be very early events in tumorogenesis.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The epigenetic processes,  like DNA -methylation, are susceptible to chemical intervention because they are reversible. The overactive of the EZH2, an enzyme that attaches methyl groups to histone proteins, produces uncontrolled cell growth and cause cancer.<br />Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is used to treat 
myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous 
leukaemia. Decitabine inhibit the activity of an enzyme called EZH2. With this treatment the amount of histone overmethylation declined dramatically, it reduces the proliferation of tumour cells.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The DNA methylation is a mitotic hereditable mark. Epigenetic control is important through development, especially in sensitive periods. A sensitive period is a period of development that is susceptible to envieronmental signals, eg. germ cells and early developmentm, differenctiation...<br /> Treating patients during sensitive periods of development would be inadvisable because normal cells could be affected. The heritability of epigenetic state ensures the same sets of genes are expressed in daughter cells and tissue homogenety and if we change this treating patients during sensitive periods we can damage the offspring.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
