    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally DNA at CpG islands in gene promoters is hypomethylated, so genes having them are typically active and expressed. In cancer, though, they might get hypermethylated, which silences the genes. It makes sense in the case of tumor suppressors, as their lacking eventually will lead to cancer.<br />In intergenic regions and repetitive elements DNA is usually methylated to stabilize the genome via preventing the expression of pseudogenes, transposable elements and retroviruses. When active, they might disrupt normal genes through various mechanisms, such as insertion into gene body, acting as transcription factors or RNA interference. Demethylation of these regions promotes said events, some of which might be cancerogenic. Examples of such include overexpression of growth factors, silencing or disrupting of genes involved in programmed cell death (apoptose).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It works via inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, which is helpful in certain oncologies caused by hypermethylation of gene promoters (myelodysplastic syndromes must belong to such kind of cancers). At low doses decitabine demethylates the promoters of tumor suppressors and/or genes involved in regulation of cell proliferation/differentiation. At high doses the drug is reported to be cytotoxic, which can be especially effective in already destabilized tumor cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable normally, as there are DNA-methyltransferases working to restore existing methylation state in de novo synthesized DNA after the cell division. However, if these proteins are somehow turned off, passive demethylation will occur and gradually cell populations will have most of genome demethylated and thus unstable.<br />Sensitive periods are periods during which the epigenetic marks are massively established over the most of genome. These include the preimplantation period during the early stages of pregnancy, and the period of generation of primordial germ cells in the more developed embryo. Changes introduced during these periods may have impact on long-term epigenetic state of individual or its descendants. Possibility of transgenerational effects which may act like genetic disorders is why it's recommended to avoid using drugs (or even be subjected to certain environments such as extreme diets) with known impact on epigenetic state during the pregnancy.</div>
