    <div class="field-value">Plagiarism was observed in question 2 of the assignment, where words were directly copied from an assignment in scribd.com submitted by a student and the same content was also present in other sites.
 
The answer by the student: 
Methylation pattern of the paternal allele - methylation ICR (imprint control region), prevent binding of CTCF ,spread methylation to silence H19 promoter, lead enhancers to access Igf2, activate Igf2 expression
Methylation pattern of the maternal allele - unmethylation ICR, binding of CTCF ,CTCF blocks the enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promoter, prohibit enhancers to access Igf2, deactivate Igf2 expression, promote H19 expression 
Wilms' tumour is a type of kidney cancer that was named after Dr Max Wilms, who first described it. It's thought to come from very specialised cells in the embryo known asmetanephric blastema. These cells are involved in the development of the child's kidneys while they're in the womb. The cells usually disappear at birth, but in many children with Wilms' tumour, cells called nephrogenic rests can still be found. Caused by maternal allele behaving like paternal allele.
Many imprinted genes are involved in growth.Loss of imprinting  (H19 for example) or overprinting (Igf2  for example) is a common feature of cancer
