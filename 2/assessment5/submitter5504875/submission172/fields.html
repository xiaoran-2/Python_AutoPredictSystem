    <h1>Submission 172 from Anon (session_user_id: 9ecc6f8e1f2688f9d96381e9643aabe69591b81d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The cytosine analogue 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine (decitabine) function is DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (class). <br /></li><li>Decitabine shows substantial potency in reactivating epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes by hypomethylating DNA. It is a hypomethylating agent that is incorporated into DNA and forms irreversible covalent adducts with DNA-methyltransferases. Decitabine has dual mechanism of action: reactivation of silenced genes and differentiation at low doses, and cytotoxicity at high doses. </li><li> In patients with MDS, an increasing variety of epigenetically inactivated genes involved in cell growth, cell cycle control, differentiation, DNA repair, and cell death is known. Therefore therapeutic reversal of epigenetic silencing using Decitabine by hypomethylating displays an effective treatment strategy for those patients.Additionally it is possible to find info about clinical study of delivering a dose of Decitabine combined with others drugs, for exaple - carboplatin, that would be capable of producing <span> therapeutic </span>effects in patients with solid tumors.<br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

It leads to cancer. </span><br /></li><li><span><span>Functions of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements : silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites, genome defence model via protecting from transposabal elements </span><br /></span></li><li><span>Hypomethylation of DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to transcriptional interference and illegitimate recombination plus doesn"t prevent transpositions of genes(deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions...) . It leads to canser</span></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Methylation pattern of the paternal allele - methylation ICR (imprint control region), prevent binding of CTCF ,spread methylation to silence H19 promoter, lead enhancers to access Igf2, activate Igf2 expression<br /></li><li>Methylation pattern of the maternal allele - unmethylation ICR, binding of CTCF ,CTCF blocks the enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promoter, prohibit enhancers to access Igf2, deactivate Igf2 expression, promote H19 expression </li><li>Wilms' tumour is a type of kidney cancer that was named after Dr Max Wilms, who first described it. It's thought to come from very specialised cells in the embryo known as<b>metanephric blastema</b><span>. These cells are involved in the development of the child's kidneys while they're in the womb. The cells usually disappear at birth, but in many children with Wilms' tumour, cells called </span><b>nephrogenic rests</b> can still be found. Caused by maternal allele behaving like paternal allele.<br /></li><li></li><li>Many imprinted genes are involved in growth.Loss of imprinting  (H19 for example) or overprinting (Igf2  for example) is a common feature of cancer</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation leads to silense some regions (and genes) of DNA. Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. For these reasons DNA hypermethylation or hypomethylation can be the causes of wide type of cancers (f.e. due hypomethylation of intergenic region or repetitive elements, due hypermethylation of CpG islands).DNA methylation <span>mitotically heritable (via DNMT1 ) and helps to maintain genomic stability. </span><br /></li><li><span>Sensitive period - period of epigenetic reprogramming (period of the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks)</span></li><li><span>Sensitive periods of development: early development (during gametogenesis , after fertilisation), PGC (primodial germ cell) reprogramming<br /></span></li><li><span>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because changing in epigenetic state of patients by "epigenetic" drugs in this case can be temproraral and possibly doesn"t give steady </span>therapeutic effects. </li></ul></div>
