    <div class="field-value">Alterations in DNA methylation are common in a variety of tumors as well as in development. Epigenetic modifications, like hypermethylation, which represses transcription of the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes leading to gene silencing, and genome wide hypomethylation have been recognized as a cause of oncogenesis. Hypomethylation usually involves repeated DNA sequences, such as long interspersed nuclear elements, whereas hypermethylation involves CpG islands.<u>  </u>Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression.  Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene.  Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands.  Hypermethylation can also occur at CpG island shores (neighboring islands).  Alterations in DNA methylation can results in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, or over expression of growth promoting genes. Repetitive elements are generally highly methylated and this status is associated with maintenance of chromosome structure and genome integrity. Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions also causes genomic instability.  When this instability occurs, illegitimate recombination occurs between repeats and activation of repeats and transposition.  Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes also occurs.  Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The <i>Igf2</i><span> and </span><i>H19</i><span> genes are reciprocally imprinted. Two regulatory regions are important for their parental allele-specific expression: a differentially methylated region (DMR) upstream of </span><i>H19</i><span> and a set of tissue-specific enhancers downstream of </span><i>H19</i><span>. The enhancers specifically activate </span><i>Igf2</i><span> on the paternal chromosome and </span><i>H19</i><span> on the maternal chromosome. The interactions between the enhancers and the genes are regulated by the DMR, which works as a selector by exerting dual functions: a methylated DMR on the paternal chromosome inactivates adjacent </span><i>H19</i><span> and an unmethylated DMR on the maternal chromosome insulates </span><i>Igf2</i> from the enhancers. (Mechamisms of lgf2/H19 Imprinting: DNA methylation, chromatin, and long distance gene regulation,Biochem<span> (2000) </span><span>127 </span><span>(5): </span>711-715)  <br /><br /><span>Normally, the </span>IGF2<span> gene undergoes genomic imprinting and only the copy inherited from a person's father is active. In some cancers, however, both the paternal and the maternal copies of the gene are active, increasing the amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 that cells can produce, which is known as loss of imprinting (LOI) and occurs in Wilm's tumuors. An increased amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 may stimulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells from being destroyed.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome.  They are nucleoside analogues, that irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, therefore replication dependent, and function as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and have shown substantial potency in reactivating epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes in vitro. <i> </i>Cancer cells are dividing more rapidly because they are replicating more. <i>  </i>At lower doses, they can also inhibit growth of tumor cell lines by an anti-neoplastic effects and improve resistance to enzymatic deamination.  The rationale behind demethylation therapies is the ability of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors to revert Cpg hypermethylation-induced gene silencing. Hypermethylation-induced gene silencing of tumor suppressor and other cancer-related genes plays a fundamental role in human tumorigenesis.  The reversion of these epigenetic mutations can therefore restore proliferation control and apoptosis sensitivity. (Modes of action of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors azacytidine and decitabine, International Journal of Cancer)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic drugs can last longer than the period of drug treatment, because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.  Once erased, they don't return, so these therapies can make changes which stop a cancer from growing.  A sensitive period is a period during development in which the developing brain has heightened sensitivity to environmental influences.  One sensitive period is from primordial germ cell development to production of mature egg and sperm, the second one is the pre-implantation and early post implantation where there is active remodeling of the epigenome. There is removal and laying down of epigenetic marks.  The change in the environment or diet can increase these changes.  Early environment stages are able to shape neural circuits and thus determine structural and functional aspects of brain and behavior for the lifespan.  Studies have shown that experiences during sensitive periods of development influence DNA methylation patterns of several genes.  Epigenetic changes and processes are so widespread.  To be successful, treatments must be selective to irregular cells; otherwise activating transcriptiojnj in normal cells could have a reverse effect and make them cancerous.  </div>
