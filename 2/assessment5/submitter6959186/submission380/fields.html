    <div class="field-value">GpC islands are regions with a high frequency of GpC sites, whcih can be in single genes, or groups of genes. Cytosines in CpG dinucleotides can be methylated, thus regulating a gene's expression. Usually GpC islands inside a gene are methylated, and in the promoter site unmethylated (although, there are promoters that are methylated - usually CpG poor promoters -), something which lead to the speculation that<em></em> <em>usually</em> methylation of CpG sites in the promoter of a gene inhibits gene expression. In cancer changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. Normal methylation, and expression patterns of gene changes: hypermethylation of some promoter GpC islands causes gene silencing; this usually happens in tumor suppressor genes. Hypomethylation has been observed in cases of oncogenes', or tumor promoting genes' promoters, leading to their overexpression (Jones and Laird, 1999), or other areas (e.g. satellite repeats); this leads to genomic instability and deregulation of genes' expression, both of which aid to the promotion of tumorigenesis. <br /> For the intergenic regions, and repetitive elements, intergenic methylation is found mostly at repetitive sequences. They are involved in imprinting, regulating of genes expression, and promoting genomic stability and an organized nuclear and chromatin structure. These areas are usually methylated in normal cells, preventing events like illegitimate recombinations from happening. In cancer, these areas become hypomethylated, and it usually happens early  in tumorigenesis, and progresses; furthermore, we have loss of imprinting, and changes in genes' (and also lnRNA, miRNA, and piRNA) expression. This could lead to illegitimate recombination between areas where it shouldn't, leading to activation of repeats, and their transposition which could lead to activation of cryptic promoters, disruption to neighbouring genes,  and also chromosomal anomalies (e.g. deletions, insertions etc) and genomic instability. Combined with changes in genes expression, tumorigenesis is promoted.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the  DNA-demethylating/hypomethylating agents; It is an DNMT inhibitor. It works by inhibiting the enzyme DNA methyltransferase, and so it aids to the hypomethylation of DNA. In cancer, the phenomenon of hypermethylation takes place, changing the expression patterns, and so the activity of several genes, including tumor suppressor genes. Decitabine, mostly used for myeloplastic syndromes, can act by reducing the hypermethylation phenomenon, aiding in the inactivation of the oncogenes, or the higher expression levels of tumor suppressor genes, among other things. It does so, by getting incorporated in DNA strands during duplication (it's a nucleoside analogue), and it binds into DNMTs, inhibiting them from functioning and creating hypermethylated areas (e.g. GpC islands in promoters), and changing genes expression, and promote tumorigenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, and on the maternal allele it is unmethylated. In the maternal allele, due to its unmethylated state, the ICR can bind the CTCF insulator, and so the enhancers will act on the H19 gene, which will be expressed. The Igf2 gene however, will be silenced, so it won't be expressed. In the paternal allele, because the ICR is methylated, the enhancers act on the Igf2 gene, which will be expressed. With loss of imprinting, something which happens in Wilm's tumor, we have hypermethylation of the ICR in both maternal and paternal alleles, and so the Igf2 gene is expressed from both alleles, which gives a double dose of a growth promoting gene (growth factor), which aids to the abnormal/excessive growth of cells, and eventually aids in tumorigenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation with drugs, makes a change in the epigenome that won't go away once the treatment stops, but rather, it will remain long after the treatment: the epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, and potentially happen in all the cells of the body, including germ cells (even during sensitive periods), so they will potentially be transferred to the offsprings of the person receiving the treatment. Sensitive periods are those from primordial germ cell development to the creation of germ cells and gametes, the pre-implantation to early post-implantation/early development (~until epiblast stage), and it's when the active remodelling of the epigenome happens (removal and establishment of epigenetic marks in the genome), and briefer periods, during tissue specific differentiation - not as broad and serious as the two aforementioned ones; these periods are sensitive to the environmental changes. If during those periods, we treat patients with drugs disrupting methylation (e.g. methyltransferase inhibitors), and thus re-setting of epigenetic marks in genes, so they wouldn't be correctly programmed, there could be serious problems with the development of the cells, the daughter cells, and even the organism as a whole (e.g. imprinting disorders, and other epigenetic anomalies).</div>
