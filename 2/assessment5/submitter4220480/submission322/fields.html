    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal DNA CpG islands is methylated to suppress gene expression. <br />But in cancer CpG islands is often more methylated than normal tissue. <br />And this accelerate gene expression, so normal tissue is more likely to become cancer. <br />Normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are to maintain genomic stability. <br />But in cancer these regions are likely to unmetylated, so the chance of cancer to survive become more bigger. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In paternal allele ICRs(imprint control regions) are hypermethylated and H19 is methylated too. So Igf2 is expressed and H19 is not expressed. <br />In maternal allele CTCF is binding to ICRs, so ICRS can't be methylated. Enhancers can't promote igf2, so Igf2 is not expressed. But H19 is expressed, because H19 is not methylated.<br />In Wilm's tumour maternal allele's ICRs is hypermethylated , so maternal allele also express Igf2. Paternal and maternal alleles both express Igf2. That leads to overexpress of Igf2 and this change is  contribute to cancer growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is DNMT inhibitor. <br />Decitabine bind to DNMT, so DNMT can't maintain DNA methylation. <br />So Decitabine can alter favourable epigenetic state for cancer to unfavourable one.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is reprogrammed in primordial germ cell development and early development, but maintained by some enzymes like DNMT1, Smchd1. So DNA methylation is epigenetically inherit to offspring. <br />Sensitive periods is the time when epigenetic marks are remodelled.<br />Epigenetic change can be to lethal to patients. Because epigenetic change can lead to severe illness like cancer and inherited to patients 's children. </div>
