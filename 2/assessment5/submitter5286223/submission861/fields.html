    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, CpG islands remain unmethylated in the DNA independently of their activity state. In cancer cells however, there is CpG island hypermethylation and this can contribute to cancer by silencing tumor suppressor genes and contributing to loss of imprinting.<br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in a normal cell, while in cancer cells, they appear unmethylated. This causes genetic instability due to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, or disruption of neighboring genes. Hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can also contribute to cancer by activating cryptic promoters. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer due to loss of expression of growth restricting genes or over expression of growth promoting genes. In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is methylated in the paternal allele, and this prevents the protein CTCF from binding to it. In the absence of CTFC, the methylation of the ICR also spreads to the H19 promoter and silences it, making Igf2 accessible to downstream enhancers and therefore expressing Igf2. In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and this allows the binding of the CTCF protein to it. This protein insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers which in that case cannot access Igf2 and so they help in the expression of H19.<br />Disrupting the imprinting at this cluster can contribute to cancer beacuse Igf2 is an oncogene, a growth promoter gene. If imprinting is disrupted and the maternal allele shows a paternal epigenotype, there would be an overexpression of Igf2 and an increase in cell growth that can lead to the formation of a tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylated agent used to treat myelodysplactic syndromes. Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor that binds DNMT (an enzymatic epigenetic regulator) and prevents it from adding new methyl groups. This can have an anti-tumor effect by activating tumor suppressor genes that were methylated before, allowing their expression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Due to the mitotic heritability of epigenetic marks, the alteration of DNA methylation in one cell can have an enduring effect on the epigenome, since the modification made to that cell's epigenome will be passed to the daughter cells through cell division. This can make the effect of epigenetic drugs last beyond treatment. However, there are sensitive periods when treatment with epigenetic drugs should be avoided. Sensitive periods are those in which there is an epigenetic reprogramming i.e. early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. Epigenetic drugs during these periods could cause alterations in the epigenome, young patients can suffer effects on their germ cells and even pass those epigenetic mistakes on to the next generations (through PGC).</div>
