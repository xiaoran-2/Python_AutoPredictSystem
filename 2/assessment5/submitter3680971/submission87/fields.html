    <div class="field-value">  In normal situations, CpG methylation is symmetric at dinucleotides. CpG islands are usually unmethylated, but is one of the most popular spot on the genome for DNA methylation in mammals. CpG methylation usually implicates gene expression silencing(X inactivation). In most cases, CpG islands are hypermethylated in cancer, meaning that they are more methylated than normal. As was said, CpG methylation usually implicates gene expression silencing, therefore once a tumour suppressor gene has undergone CpG hypermethylation, it is inactivated and can no longer suppress tumor growth.<br />  In normal situations,
intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated, Their methylation maintains genomic integrity, preventing things such as deletions, translocations, insertions, etc. Both this DNA methylation and the other are mitotically heritable. In most cases, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancer,
meaning that they are less methylated than normal. As was said,
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements maintains genomic integrity and stability, therefore hypomethylation of such regions will result in genomic instability, transposable elements will "break free", causing inadequate activation or silencing of genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">  In the paternal allele, H19 is imprinted. If H19 were imprinted, it would be inactivated, because it is positioned in an imprint control region(ICR), and the imprinting would cause CTCF, an insulator protein, to be unable to bound, and so the Igf2 would not be insulated from downstream enhancers and be enhanced, and H19 would just be ignored. In the maternal allele, H19 is not imprinted, and the reverse of (1) happens. CTCF will have no trouble binding, Igf2 will be shielded from the enhancers, and the enhancers would just look at H19 and enhance it.<br />  As was said, H19 is not imprinted in the maternal allele, therefore Igf2, which is an oncogene, has a slight and adequate dose. But if like in Wilm's tumour, H19 is imprinted, then both alleles will exhibit the oncogene, causing the cell to have a heavy and inadequate dose of it. So and so, a tumour!<br />  The example of Wilm's tumour give us a way of diagnosis(identifying the primary tumour,what type it is, and what sub-type it is, etc) and prognosis, it even gives the way of monitoring the progress of the disease.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent. As the name suggests, it demethylates DNA. No doubt it kills tumours by stopping CpG hypermethylation, the mechanism of which is already described in Q1.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">  An overdose of DNA-demethylating agent would cause hypomethylation, resulting in genome instability; an overdose of <span>DNA-methylating agent would cause hypermethylation, resulting in an over activation of oncogenes. <br />  A sensitive period is a time when environmental influences can have the greatest impact on epigenetic control. There are two most significant sensitive periods of development, early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. Per definition, environmental influences during sensitive periods could be more dangerous than any other time, the danger being affecting epigenetic control in such a negative fashion that the recipient could not only have him/herself hurt, abut also hurt his/her offspring, giving that cellular epigenetics is heritable.<br /></span></div>
