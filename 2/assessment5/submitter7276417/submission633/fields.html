    <h1>Submission 633 from Anon (session_user_id: d9653f9d5d42a698c0c302555c55f6d405dccb3e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-hypomethylating
agent that incorpates into DNA during replication and inhibits DNA
methyltransferase thereby causing demethylating. Decitabine inhibits DNA
methylation which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression
of DNA synthesis. Decitabine can have anti-tumour effect following its
conversion to decitabine triphosphate which results in hypomethylation of DNA
and cellular differentiation or apoptosis.In neoplastic cells,decitabine-induced hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that
are important for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation.The
cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent
adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine that has been incorporated
into DNA in rapidly dividing cells. Non-proliferating cells are insensitive to
decitabine.(<a href="http://www.clinicalepigeneticsjournal.com/content/pdf/1868-7083-5-3.pdf" title="Link: http://www.clinicalepigeneticsjournal.com/content/pdf/1868-7083-5-3.pdf">http://www.clinicalepigeneticsjournal.com/content/pdf/1868-7083-5-3.pdf</a>)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Commonly , DNA
methylation occurs usually in intergenic region  and repetitive region and
rarely at the CpG islands. The function of DNA methylation which occurs at CpG
islands is silencing of gene expression. Wherelse, in intergenic region and
repetitive region, the DNA methylation functions to maintain genomic integrity
and to protect the genome from transposable elements. DNA hypermethylation at
CpG islands and DNA hypomethylation and genomic instability at intergenic and
repetitive region contributes to cancer.CpG islands on tumor suppressor genes can become hypermethylated which inactivates the genes.Similar effect can be achieved more traditionally through mutation of the gene.Various intron, intergenic
and especially repetitive element regions of the DNA tend to become hypomethylated
in cancer.This leads to all kinds of trouble due to genmic instability (deletion,insertion ,reciprocal translocations). I.e. experiment : Take adult mouse and suppress DNMT1 in some cell type selectively which leads to hypomethylation in tissue and increase genomic instability and subsequently the animal will develop cancer. However, deletion of DNMT1 can both enhance or suppress tumorigenesis since different tumours have different dependencies. Id driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation,depletion of DNA methylation appears to supress tumorigenesis.If driven by chromosomal instability,depletion of DNA methylation enhances tumorigenesis. </p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted control region is
methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele which
means it is paternally imprinted. In another word the DNA methylation imprint
is on the paternal chromosome and not on the maternal chromosome.  Paternal methylation at the ICR prevents CTCF
binding and together with methylation at the H19 promoter allows the enhancers
to access Igf2.On the maternal allele the ICR remains unmethylated allowing CTCF
and its cofactors to bind. This interaction mediates enhancer blocking allowing
downstream enhancers to insulate Igf2 and access the H19 promoter. Imprinting
at the H19/Igf2 cluster is distrupted in Wilm’s tumour (embryonic/childhood tumour) as it is caused by maternal allele behaving like paternal allele due to
mutation or deletion with the region, uniparental disomy and epigenetic distruption.In Wilm's tumour,epigenetic changes are associated with relaxation of maternal Igf2 imprinting and silencing of H19 (<u><a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v7/n3/abs/ng0794-433.html" title="Link: http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v7/n3/abs/ng0794-433.html">http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v7/n3/abs/ng0794-433.html</a>).</u>Disrupting imprinting
at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer as upregulation of Igf2
expression promotes growth (an oncogene).This will cause the appearance of
paternal like allele and loss of maternal like allele which increases the
expression of Igf2 and  suppresses Cdkn1c
expression. Hence, growth promotion occurs constantly as inhibiting the growth
does not occur at all.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome as
the epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division from a parent cell
into daughther cells and subsequent cells until they are actively and
permanently erased.  Hence, drugs that change
DNA methylation can alter and prevent the growth of tumour cells in an
irreversible way without destroying all the cells. Sensitive period is period of epigenetic reprogramming when changes in the environment that is going to have biggest effect on the epigenetic control. The sensitive periods of development are the germ cell development and early embryonic development.Patients treated during sensitive periods would be
inadvisable as it will disrupt a tissue development and worsen the risk of the
disease.I<span>n primordial germ cells, in which parental
imprints are erased and totipotency is restored. Imprint marks are then re-established during spermatogenesis or oogenesis, depending on gender. Disruption
of imprinting due to the treatment can cause growth defects.</span></p><p></p></div>
