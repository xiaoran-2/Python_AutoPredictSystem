    <h1>Submission 181 from Anon (session_user_id: cd3a100faff2c15bedd1f2af84fa5d63548ab63b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent that inhibit DNA methyltransferase, thus opening up transcription of genes. In the case of Decitabine, these genes would be tumour suppressors that will help prevent rapid generation of tumour cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer, there are usually two type of DNA methylation that deviates from the norm to cause cancer cells. First of all is DNA hypermethylation around CpG islands, where promoter of tumor suppressor genes are found. In a normal CpG island, these genes would not be methylated and expressed normally, thus stopping tumor growth, however, when CpG island become hypermethylated, the suppressor genes are silenced, and could result in cancer cells that lives on instead of dying.<br /><br />The second type is DNA hypomethylation of intergenic regions or repetitive elements. These regions are normally methylated which help maintain genome stability, however in cancer cells, hypomethylation occurs in these region which stop DNA methylation from happening and genome becomes unstable. When this happen, events like insertion, deletion or translocation of chromosome occur and tumorigenesis will be enhanced.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, lgf2 expression is expressed as ICR is methylated, which blocks binding of CTCF, thus allowing the enhancer to reach the lgf2 gene. As for H19, it is silenced via methylated promoter in this case and thus NOT expressed.<br /><br />In the maternal allele, lgf2 expression is NOT expressed as ICR is NOT methylated, thus attracting CTCF binding which then blocks the enhancer from reaching lgf2 gene. As for H19,  it is NOT silenced via methylated promoter in this case and thus is expressed by the enhancer.<br /><br />When imprinting is disrupted, for example via hypermethylation, the maternal allele will have its ICR methylated too, causing BOTH maternal and paternal allele to freely express lgf2. And BOTH H19 gene are silenced as well. This leads to cancerous cell as lgf2 is growth promoting, which then leads to Wilm's tumor.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">It is possible that external <span>epigenetic </span>changes, such as those from altering DNA methylation with epigenetic drug, could be passed on to daughter cells and granddaughter cells during cell division until being actively erased.<br />It is then important to avoid epigenetic drugs during active remodeling of the epigenome, also known as "sensitive period", which are during the primoridla germ cell to egg/sperm development and pre-implantation and post-implantation period of embryonic development. During these period large amount of epigenetic reprogramming occurs and the effect of external epigenetic drug might have unknown long term effect that can lead to tumorigenesis.<br /></div>
