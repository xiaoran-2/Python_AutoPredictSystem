    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is silencing gene expression. Some CpG islands are hypermethylated in cancer turning down expression certain genes such as tumor suppressors. In contrast there can be hypomethylation of intergeneic regions and repetitive elements in cancer. The normal function of methylation in these regions is to help maintain genomic stability. When they are hypomethylated in cancer, there is genomic instability.  In addition the hypomethyation of certain CpG poor promoters turns on oncogenes. There can also be hypo- or hypermethylation that results in the loss of imprinting.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele there is methylation at a ICR which blocks the binding of the CTCF insulator protein (which keeps the downstream enhancers from turning on Igf2 expression) and thus Igf2 expression is turned on. However the methylation at the ICR spreads to the promoter of H19 turning off expression of H19.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the maternal allele, there isn't methylation at the ICR so CTCF binds to it insulating Igf2 from the downstream enhancers, turning off Igf2 expression. However the enhancers work on H19, turning on expression of H19.</p><p>In Wilm's tumor the maternal allele has methylation at the ICR so CTCF doesn't bind so the enhancers act on Igf2 and Igf2 is expressed on both alleles leading to over expression of Igf2. In contrast H19 is expressed on either allele since both alleles now act as paternal alleles. Igf2 is a growth-promoting oncogene and is overexpressed in Wilm's tumor.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent. Some CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes can be hypermethylated in cancer leading to reduced expression of tumor suppressors. Decitabine could be used to treat this.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs can influence the genome of dividing cells other than cancer cells. These changes are mitotically heritable so could have long lasting effects. A sensitive period is when there is establishment of epigenetic marks such as early pregnancy and during germ cell development which can lead to transgenerational effects. Thus it may be inadvisable to treat young people with developing germ cells with epigenetic drugs.</p></div>
