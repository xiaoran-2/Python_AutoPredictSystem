    <h1>Submission 724 from Anon (session_user_id: b0145dbf6c00f8dd95e2da5099cb19d1f0a1a612)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating drug. As over-activity of DNA methylating enzyme can cause silencing of genes including tumor supressor genes which acts to prevent tumorigenesis, then Decitabine by reducing the DNA methylation level will cause nearby genes to be active leading to an increase in tumor-suppressor activity thereby having an anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands is usually and normally reduced as methylation is associated with gene silencing and CpG islands correspond to promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes. In cancer cells, CpG islands are found to be hypermethylated  and therefore leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes and aids tumorigenesis. On the other hand, in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation is necessary for genomic stability and helps in silencing gene expression in satellite repeats and elements of DNA such as LINEs and SINEs. In cancer, there is hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements and this will lead to genomic instability, and disruption of regulation of cell proliferation and growth especially if the changes occur in the region of growth/proliferation promoting genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele and this lead via a sequence of event to Igf2 expression. On the other hand the imprint control region is unmethylated on the maternal allelle and therefore Igf2 is not expressed. In Wilm's tumor, there is methylation of the imprint control region in the maternal allele in addition to the normal methylation that do occur on the paternal allele, thus the dosage of Igf2 in the cells is increased as a result of over-expression of Igf2 gene. Igf2 is growth promoting and this lead to proliferation that contribute to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation alteration, like other epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable and so are passed on to daughter cells during cell division, unless they are erased during the period of epigenetic reprogramming that occurs during early development in blastocyst and during gamete formation in germline, the otherwise known as sensitive periods. For effects of the said drug to last beyond the period of treatment, then it is possible that the drug causes a change or changes that stop cancer cells from growing without killing all the cells in the population (in other words, leaving a small remnant). Treatment during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as the drug-induced changes can be easily cleared.</div>
