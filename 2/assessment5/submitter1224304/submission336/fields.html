    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually clustered at
the gene’s promoter. Methylation of the CpG islands on these promoters causes
the gene to curl around the histone backbone and thus silence its activity. In
cancer, genes that normally are un-methylated (active) such as tumor suppressor genes may be silenced due to methylation of the CpG islands in their promoters. This CpG methylation silences the tumor suppressor genes, promoting tumor growth. Additionally, oncogenes (genes that promote growth) may become active due to a change in methylation in cancer. The methylation effect is context dependent and time dependent.</p>

<p>Our DNA contains a large number of
repetitive elements between genes, as well as large intergenic regions. These can cause genomic instability. Therefore these repetitive elements and intergenic regions are usually methylated and heterochromatinzed to prevent
this from happening. In the cancerous cell these intergenic regions and repetitive
elements are hypomethylated allowing them to transpose and cause reciprocal translocation between chromosomes, as well as deletion or insertions of genetic material in wrong places during mitosis. This is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Hypomethylation of the repeats also allows them to be active and transpose into new regions such as gene promoters, thus interfering with the normal gene activity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele the imprint control region of the HK19
gene is methylated causing its silencing. Enhancers are now free to bypass the
silenced HK19 gene and activate the Igf2 gene instead. In the healthy maternal
allele, the imprint control is un-methylated and free to bind to a shielding
protein CTCF. This frees the HK19 gene to be expressed by the enhancers. Igf2
is then inactivated in the maternal allele.</p>

<p><span>In Wilms tumor the imprint control in the maternal allele
is methylated (=silenced) just as in the paternal allele, activating the maternal
Igf2 gene in addition to the paternally derived Igf2. As Igf2 is a growth promoter,
the extra Igf2 growth gene stimulates tumor growth and prevents damaged cells
from being destroyed.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT1 inhibitor acting on the DNMT1
protein (enzyme) which is normally responsible for maintaining methylation
during mitosis. Decitabine is incorporated into the DNA upon replication and
binds irreversibly to DNMT1 blocking its activity. This prevents the mitotic
inheritance of the gene silencing methylation and stops the cancerous process potentially leading
to a shrinking of the tumor. As cancer cells multiply faster than normal body
cells, Decitabine works preferentially in cancer cells. Right now Decitabine is prescribed for blood cancerous processes, as it may be difficult to insert it into the bulk of a cancerous growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a part of the
information passed on from a cell to its daughter cells during mitosis, in
addition to the DNA code itself. However, unlike the DNA code, the epigenetic
methylation information can be erased in mitosis due to various causes, among
them drugs. This erasure then has an enduring effect on the epigenome of all
next generation cells. We do not know why such epigenetic alteration seems to
act in synergy with chemotherapy, but the observed effect indicates that epigenetic modifications were indeed created by the epigenetic drugs.</p>

<p>The epigenetic machinery is mostly
active in three periods in life: early embryonic development, germline
generation in the embryo and, to a lesser extent, during maturation of the
germline in early childhood. These are the sensitive periods. Treating patients
during these periods may interfere with either embryonic development,
potentially causing fetus abnormality, or with the germline, potentially
causing infertility or abnormalities of the patient offspring.</p></div>
