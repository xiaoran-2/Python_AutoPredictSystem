    <h1>Submission 244 from Anon (session_user_id: 521650408e36e0064a507d45061d8160779342bb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine (trade name Dacogen) is a DNA-demethylation agent used as an anti-cancer drug, which means it inhibits the epigenetics of DNA methylation. It is part of a class of drugs that are used to treat </span><span>myelodysplastic syndromes, which are precursors for leukaemia. Cancers concentrate methylation at CpG islands because it inhibits tumor suppressor genes, so demethylation agents can inhibit their proliferation. Cancers tend to already be demethylated everywhere else, and these treatments do not affect the non-cancer cells. Leukaemia is easier to treat in this way than solid tumors, due to ease of accessibility.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changing DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that will be passed down to daughter cells until the changes are actively erased. Consequently, the effects of the treatement will last beyond the treatment, possibly even across generations if done at the wrong times. Sensitive periods are situations where lasting epigenetic changes, due to environmental factors, are mitotically heritable and can even be passed down the germline. Examples include puberty when sex cells are developing, as well early in embryonic development when methylation markers are being reset, and when oocytes first develop within female embryos. It is inadvisable to treat patients with these sorts of drugs during sensitive periods, because they can affect the future health of as yet unborn children and grandchildren.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands have a strong tendency to be located before the start of genes, which means that their methylation will tend to suppress the promoters. In cancer, hypomethylation can cause over-expression of oncogenes, and hypermethylation can suppress tumor suppressor genes. It constitutes one of the possible "hits" in the Knudson hypothesis, which says cancer results from multiple hits as opposed to a single mistake.<br /><br />Ordinarily, DNA methylation is used in intergenic regions / repetitive elements for genomic stability, but in cancer these regions are widely demethylated. Hypomethylation in cancer leads to undesirable recombinations - deletions, insertions, translocations -  transposition, activation of repeats and cryptic promoters, and disrupting neighboring genes. If the cancer happens to be driven by genomic instability, demethylation agents will actually exacerbate tumorigenesis, so the kind of cancer is very important with context-dependent treatment. (In contrast, you would want to use demethylation if the cancer is driven by hypermethylation of CpG islands.)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of imprinting at ICRs from hyper/hypo-methylation can contribute to cancer by under-expression of growth restricting genes or over-expression of growth promoting genes.<br /><br />With the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele has methylation on H19 but active Igf2, so Igf2 is expressed. The maternal allele is unmethylated on H19, with CTCF capped, so Igf2 is not expressed. A normal cell has Igf2 expressed by the paternal allele, and H19 by the maternal allele.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, both alleles are methylated in the same way as the paternal allele, which means the imprinting has been disrupted. So, Igf2 is over-expressed and H19 is under-expressed. The problem is that Igf2 is a growth factor gene, so its over-expression due to hypermethylation of H19/CTCF promotes tumorigenesis and thus cancer.</div>
