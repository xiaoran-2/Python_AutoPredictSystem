    <h1>Submission 211 from Anon (session_user_id: 3053066daa72544ae4ff6db2c31358e15a568f10)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1)Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, which includes azacitidine (vidaza). <br />2)Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation via acting as a nucleoside analog that irreversibly binds to and inhibits DNMT1 when it tries to methylate the daughter strand DNA. <br />3)In its overall effect, Decitabine may act as a potentiator, making the tumour cells more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. That is, studies have shown that decitabine itself does not kill any tumor cells. However, when given prior to routine chemotherapeutic drugs, patients displayed unexpectedly good reaction.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1)Altering DNA methylation allows for epigenetic changes to be passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased, as opposed to other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example). <br />2)A sensitive period refers to the time frame during which the environment can influence the epigenetic makeup of a cell. It is not true that an altered environment during any period of development could alter the epigenetic outcome and thereby alter the phenotype; <br />3)rather there are two major sensitive periods that affect the entire organism. These include the period between primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperm. The second period consists of pre-implantation period until early post-implantation period. These are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome. There may be sensitive periods that affect individual tissues and organs as well. <br />4)Treatment of patients during sensitive periods influences their mitotic and also meiotic heritability. That is, it could elicit a cascade of events that could affect the entire organism via transgenerational epigenomic inheritance. The changes that are induced in the germ cells might be passed down to the next generation.<div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">1)DNA methylation at Cpg islands denotes silencing of gene expression, especially if  it's found in promoters.<br />2)CpG islands are more likely to be methylated in cancerous as opposed to a normal cell, which mostly consists of hypomethylated CpG islands. The CpG islands are typically found in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes.<br />3) A cancer cell is able to inactivate tumor suppressor genes in one of two ways. It could either do so genetically, or it could silence the tumor suppressor gene epigenetically via methylation. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable; as such this mode of epigenetic silencing can be effectively applied to affect multiple cells across several generations. <br />4)a)DNA methylation in the intergenic regions confers genomic stability. In other words, it protects against chromosome duplications, abnormal recombinations, translocations (movement of a large portion of one chromosome to another chromosome), insertions, and deletions. DNA methylation in the intergenic region also prevents transcriptional interference, and abnormal splicing. <br />b)DNA methylation of repetitive elements prevents mutagenic transposition (jumping genes) from occuring. This can be accomplished in either one of two ways. Firstly, the methylation of CpG elements in the strong promoters prevents transcription from occuring. Secondly, since methylation is mutagenic, the conversion of methylcytosine into thymine prevents transposition from taking place over evolutionary time; the promoters will not function properly anymore, as a result. In addition, silencing of repeats could also prevent transcriptional interference. Lastly, methylation of repeats could also prevent illegitimate recombination from occurring as a result of an open permissive chromosomal structure.<br />5)The intergenic intervals and their repetitive elements, tend to be hypomethylated in cancer.<br />6)Unmethylated intergenic intervals and repetitive elements lead to genomic-instability (See examples above). These could increase the risk of cancer. Experiments in which reductions in DNMT induce cancers in specific mice-tissues(eg.thymus) yield evidence in support of this.<br /><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1)In the paternal allele DNA methylation at the ICR (intergenic control region) blocks binding of the CTCF protein. This allows for DNA methylation to spread downstream to the H19 promoter. With the H19 promoters silenced enhancers can access Igf2 upstream of the ICR to activate it.<br />2)In the maternal allele CTCF acts an insulator protein that shields IGF2 from downstream enhancers. IGF2 expression is inhibited.<br /><div><span>3)In wilm's tumor the maternal allele adopts a paternal epigenotype. In other words, it has a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 tumor suppression promoter thereby turning it off. On the other hand, IGF2, an oncogene, is turned on. So there are two paternal alleles, which together, generate too much IGF2. <br />4)Too much of IGF2 and too little activation of H19 shifts the balance towards cancer/tumor production. </span><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
