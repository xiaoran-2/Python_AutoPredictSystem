    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation
at CpG islands control genetic expression through the activation of gene promoters.
It is known that a CpG island methylated represses gene expression. </p>

<p><span>Aberrant
methylation  alters the normal expression
of genes, and so deregulates homeosthasis. The inappropriate methylation (or hypermethylation)
of a Tumor Gene Suppressor promoter can enhance carcinogenesis while inhibiting
it, but the inappropriate demethylation of an Oncogene promoter can affect it
as well while activating it. </span></p>

<p>Then, aberrant
epigenetic control can enable a cell to evade growth suppressors, genome
instability and mutation, replicativa immortality, tumor-promoting inflammation,
invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis, to avoid immune control, resist cell
death, deregulate cellular energetic and sustaining proliferative signaling. </p>

<p>Methylation
also regulates the expression of intergenic regions, introns, repetitive
elements and also, transposable elements. Comparing a normal cell to a
tumorogenic, we observe that the tumorogenic is used to have this regions
unmethylated. </p>

<p>Methylation
in intergenic regions can also be altered in cancer; altering gene expression,
splicing and normal interactions between insulators, enhancers and promoters to
a gene. </p>

<p><span>This fact,
then alters the normal expression of genes, deregulating homeosthasis and
making more probable for a tumor to occur.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting
control regions are controlled by methylation. In Igf2, normally we observe:</p>

<p><span>-       </span>The paternal
Igf2 allele is expressed because of the activation of some enhancers
downstream. This enhancers do not activate paternal H19 locus due to a methylation
in CTCF, an insulator that is inactivated.</p>

<p><span>-       </span><span>The maternal
Igf2 allele is repressed because CTCF is unmethylated and does not allow
enhancers to activate Igf2 expression. On the other hand, maternal H19 locus is
being activated by the same reason.  </span></p>

<p>In Wilm’s
tumour we observe a methylation of both CTCF alleles, making a disregulation of
genes expression. Igf2 is activated in both alleles (maternal and paternal) but
H19 is silenced. The double dose of Igf2 and the null dose of H19 causes Wilm’s
tumour. </p>

<p><span>Igf2 is an
insulin-like growth factor, a gene that is characteristic of tumorogenic
tissues. If it is overexpressed, this gene promotes cell growth, proliferation
and invasion and methastasis. Then, it causes tumorogenesis. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
(also known as 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine or by IUPAC; 4-Amino-1-(2-deoxy-β-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-1,3,5-triazin-2(1H)-one
) is a antineoplastic drug. </p>

<p>Is
classified as an antimetabolite and an hypomethylating drug that by incorporating
itself into DNA strands, inhibits DNMT1 (DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1).
</p>

<p>The incorporation
of Decitabine-triphosphate into nucleic acid inhibits DNMT1 (the enzyme that
methylates newly synthesized DNA in mammalian cells) thereby causing demethylation
in that recent-generated sequence.</p>

<p>Decitabine
acts like an anti-tumoural drug because of:</p>

<p><span>-       </span>It works
by demethylaling DNA, reducing methylation in Tumour Supressor Genes. When TS Genes
are methylated, they are not expressed. This fact promotes cancer because of
the deregulation in cell division. Therefore, Decitabine promotes TSG
expression, reducing cancer. </p>

<p><span>-       </span><span>It affects
rapidly dividing cells, formatting covalent adducts between DNMT1 and
Decitabine that has been incorporated into DNA. These adducts induce apoptosis,
therefore making the tumour to decrease. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>By
altering DNA methylation on an early-stage we can induce genes to modify their
expression, and these genes can be modified since then. We can also modify
epigenome and, because it can be inherited, alter future epigenomes and the genetic
expression that comes from.</p>

<p>A sensitive
period, talking about epigenetics, is that time when an individual is more
prone to be affected. </p>

<p><span>An example
is when an embryo is developing. During this step, there are two phases where
there is a reduction in DNA methylation; these are during the formation of
blastocyst and during the formation of primordial germ cells.   </span></p>

<p><span>In these
periods is inadvisable to treat patients because development is being done and
alterations in gene expression can induce to aberrant structures or simply, to death.
