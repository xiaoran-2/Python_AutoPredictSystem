    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>On the one hand, the
normal function of DNA methylation in CPG islands is the repression of the
expression of the genes. In cancer, the DNA methylation of CPG islands is
disrupted. In some types of tumoral cells exist a hypermethylation of CPG
islands. This type of DNA
hypermethylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour
suppressor genes in cancer. DNA methylation is mitotically
heritable and epimutations are rapidly selected, so the tumoral cells inherit
this hypermetylation.  Epimutations are reversible, unlike mutations, that is why they could be
an important area to study in cancer. These are some examples of
hypermethylation: RB in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer, BRCA1 in
breast cancer, and MGMT in gliomas and colorectal tumours Nowadays, it is described a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) in
some cancers where CpG islands of a set of genes are frequently methylated such
as colorectal cancer, gliomas, neuroblastoma and others</p>

<p>It is also important to mention that hypermethylated
CpG islands are different in different kinds of tumour. That’s why the
methylation state of CPG islands could be used as a diagnostic or prognostic
biomarker. And it also could be used as a monitor of the tumour decline or
recurrence.</p>

<p><span>On the other hand, the normal function of DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain the
genome stability. In cancer, the DNA methylation in intergenic regions and
repetitive elements is disrupted. In tumoral cells, this regions are
hypomethylated. The hypomethylation of these regions results in a Genomic
Instability. The genomic inestability occurs because of the illegitimate
recombination between repeats, the activation of repeats and transposition, or
the activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal maternal allele has no methylation, so H19
is expressed. CTCF is also expressed, and the enhancers can’t access to Igf2.
So Igf2 is repressed in the maternal allelle of a normal cell. </p>

<p>The normal paternal allelle is methylated, and H19 is
repressed. CTCF is not bound to its target, so the enhancers can access to Igf
2, and this gene is expressed.</p>

<p>As a result of those, in a normal cell, Igf2 is
expressed in the paternal copy, and it is repressed in the maternal copy.</p>

<p>Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in
Wilm’s tumour. The maternal allelle is also methylated (like a paternal
allelle), so H19 is repressed, and Igf 2 is expressed.</p><p>This hypermethylation results in the expression of both allelles of Igf2 in
the tumoral cell (the paternal and the maternal copy). This concludes in the
overexpression of Igf2, a growth-promoting gene that contributes to the
proliferation of the cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic
inhibitor that belongs to the class of DNA demethylating agents. It is used for
treatement for myelodysplasic syndromes. </p>

<p>One way that Decitabine works is by demethylation
or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By this process of
demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus
restoring control over cell growth.</p>

<p><span>Decitabine also belongs to the category of
chemotherapy called antimetabolites.  Antimetabolites are very similar to
normal substances within the cell.  When the cells incorporate these
substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets
within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of
rapidly dividing cancer cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the
basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome
inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. Generally, DNA methylation of
promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. Exceptions are CpG
islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters. They have a high CpG
density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity
state. </p>

<p>A sensitive period
is the period when reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs. Although DNA
methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent
cell generations, reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during gametogenesis
and after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC).</p>

<p><span>Treating patients
during sensitive periods would be inadvisable, because the global DNA
methylation pattern could be altered completely, producing unexpectedly bad
effects to the cells. </span></p></div>
