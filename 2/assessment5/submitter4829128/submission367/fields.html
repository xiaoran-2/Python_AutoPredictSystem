    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells DNA methylation at CpG islands results in formation of a repressive chromatin structure and  by secondary mechanism can  prohibit transcription binding factor and alter gene expression.In cancer there is DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands (locus specific).Hypermethylation silences tumour suppressor genes.<br />DNA methylation in intergenic and repetitive leads to heterochromatisation. There is genome wide hypomethylation in intergenic   and repetitive region. Hypomethylation at the repetitive region causes genomic instability(deletion,reciprocal translocation,insertion) and at CpG poor promoter(intergenic) leads to activation of oncogene and silencing tumour suppressor through miRNA.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In paternal allele Imprint control regions (ICR)are methylated . CTCF does not bind to insulator element and hence enhancers can activate Igf2 expression .<br />ICR in maternal allele are not methylated  and can bind to insulator element and enhancers act on H19 and Igf2 is silenced. <br />Both maternal and paternal allele are methylated hence there is a double dose of Igf2 gene expression leading to Wilm's tumour.<br />Wilm's tumour is an example of hypermethylation at the imprint control region which contain many genes responsible for growth.(loss of imprinting).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNMTi (dna methyl transferase inhibitors- DNA demethylating agents). <br />Decitabine reduces hyper methylation on histone which is responsible for silencing tumour suppressor gene.<br />Decitabine combines with a histone deacetylase inhibitor and slows tumour growth.This <span>epigenetic drug altered the tumour cells which responded to standard chemotherapy drugs.</span><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>  Epigenetic changes are mitotic heritability passed on to generations  until they are actively erased. Once erased they do not appear.  Hence  epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without the need to kill all the cells.<br />Sensitive period is when altered environment (diet,maternal care,chemical exposure) have an effect on epigenetic control.<br />sensitive periods of development are during primordial germ cell development to gametes and from gametes to blastocyst(early gamete development).<br />Epigenetic drugs change epigenetic patterns in cancer cells. hence it is not advisable during primordial germ cell development and gamete development when epigenetic marks are imprinted.</span></div>
