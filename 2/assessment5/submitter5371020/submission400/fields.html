    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation is to regulate gene expression by inhibiting binding of transcription factors to DNA or the recruitment of proteins involved in gene repression, effectively silencing expression. Methylation is essential for silencing retroviral elements, regulating tissue-specific gene expression, X chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting. Around 45% of a mammalian genome consists of transposable and viral elements silenced by bulk methylation as they are potentially harmful if expressed, as replication can lead to gene disruption and DNA mutation. <br /><br />Most CpG islands are evolutionarily conserved to promote gene expression by regulating chromatin structure and transcription factor binding. CpG islands contain less nucleosomes, maintaining an open DNA structure which enhances accessibility to transcription machinery. In cancer there is global decrease but a regional increase in methylation (hypermethylation) at distinct sites of promoter-associated CpG islands and the genes associated with these areas are silenced. Silencing of tumour suppressor genes is associated with increased cell growth and cancer. DNA is normally methylated in repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns of genes. Hypomethylation in cancer, common in repeats, results in illegitimate recombination of repeats (this type of recombination requires similar sequences and open chromatin) and these repeats can jump around the genome, activate neighbouring genes and result in additional deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocation and general genomic instability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 and H19 expression are closely linked. H19 is a gene for a long non coding RNA and is expressed exclusively on one parental allele (imprinted), being transcribed only from the maternally inherited allele with the paternal allelle not being expressed. Igf2 and H19 are expressed in the same tissues during the development of the foetus. In normal cells the paternal Igf2 and maternal H19 genes are expressed, because the maternal Igf2 is unmethylated in the maternal allele and therefore not expressed and the paternal allele is methylated and therefore expressed. In Wilm's tumour imprinting is lost and the maternal chromosome reverts to a paternal epigenotype with a paternal pattern of methylation causing increased cell growth and cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-methylating agent and a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogue which is incorporated during DNA replication. When DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) comes to bind the DNA it becomes irreversibly bound. This mode of action is therefore replication dependent and behaves as an antimetabolite stopping the DNA from replicating once it is incorporated into the DNA. It has an anti-tumour effect by causing DNA methylation which restores normal function to the silenced tumour suppressing genes and they start working again. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic changes are passed on during mitotic cell division, passing on changes in gene regulation to daughter cells. Once changed, these changes are inherited. During sensitive periods, i.e. in early embryonic development, at the embryonic stem cell stage and a little later during primordial germ cell development when epigenetic reprogramming happens. Treating patients during sensitive periods may adversely affect the methylation patterns required for optimal development of the foetus (embryonic stem cells and primordial germ cell development), interfering with the epigenetic reprogramming resulting in altered expression patterns leading to defects in the growing embryo and their children.</div>
