    <div class="field-value">DNA is methylated in normal cells for a variety of reasons which include structuring of DNA into heterochromatin, imprinting and X inactivation.  All of these processes involve the silencing of certain genes which is the function of DNA methylation.  CpG islands are usually not methylated, but can become hypermethylated in cancer cells.  This has the effect of silencing the gene.  If the gene is a tumour suppressing gene, this may allow the cancer cells to proliferate at a rapid rate.<br />The regions between genes and repetitive elements are usually methylated and/or bundled into heterochromatin to stop them being transcribed, and this is because the transcription process, particularly for repetitive elements is prone to error.  The types of error that can occur during the process of replication include transposition of elements and insertions and deletions.  Hypomethylation of these regions of DNA can lead to them being transcribed, and thus the likelihood of the these types of errors increases. The more of these structural errors that occur, the greater the chance of tumourigenesis. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As we have seen, disruptions to patterns of methylation can result in tumourigenesis.  One of the ways that this can happen is through disruptions to the methylation process during imprinting. Using the H19/Igf2 cluster as an example, we know that normally the maternal allele is unmethylated at the imprint control region, whilst the paternal allele is methylated.  On the maternal allele, this allows the binding of CTFC to the ICR which in turn blocks the action of the enhancers on the Igf2 gene; so only H19 can be expressed on the maternal allele.  On the paternal allele, the methylation of the ICR stops CTFC from binding, thus allowing the enhancers to activate expression of Igf2 and bypassing the H19 gene altogether.  The effect in normal cells is regulation of growth.<br /><br />When there is disruption of the methylation pattern, both alleles may be methylated at the ICR which has the effect of two paternal alleles, and over expression of Igf2 without the regulating action of H19.  This can cause rapid, unchecked growth of cells and the development of Wilm's Tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).  The way it works is that the drug molecules (nucleoside analogues) attach to strands of DNA after replication.  DNMT then binds to these sites and are permanently attached.  This has the effect of hypomethylating the DNA.  However, the efficiency and safety of Decitabine and other drugs in the same class, is optimised at lower doses, as the effect of widespread hypomethylation throughout the genome given by larger doses, can cause serious side effects, whereas lower doses tend to target cells which are rapidly replicating.<br /><br />The anti-tumour effect of Decitabine comes about because it reverses the effect of hypermethylation seen in cancer.  This hypermethylation stops the tumour suppressor genes from being expressed, and allows cancers to proliferate aggressively.  Removing the hypermethylation  enables the tumour suppressor genes to function.  At present, Decitabine works well on Myeloid Dyplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukaemia.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes to DNA are mitotically heritable.  This means that during mitosis, the epigenetic marks are copied and passed on to each new generation of cells.  Drugs that  alter the methylation marks will not only affect the cells that come into contact with the drug, but also all the cells that are generated by cell division.  It is in this way, that different tissue types keep generating the same tissue throughout the life of an organism.<br /><br />There are periods however, when the epigenome is unstable, and this is due to changes being made which will have lasting consequences for the development  and growth of the organism.  These periods are known as sensitive periods, and they occur during early embryonic development, for example, to allow for imprinting and X inactivation.  Another sensitive period is during germ cell development, and this is when oocytes and sperm cells make alterations to epigenetic marks.  It would not be advisable to treat patients with drugs that alter the epigenome during sensitive periods, as there is no way of targeting particular regions, and ensuring that others are left untreated.  As we have seen, the effects of these changes are mitotically heritable and could have unforeseen consequences.</div>
