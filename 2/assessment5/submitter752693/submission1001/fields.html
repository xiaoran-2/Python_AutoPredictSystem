    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is
the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X-chromosome
inactivation or the function of heterochromatin. The modification of the C5
position of the cytosine base (5mC) is found in around ~80% of CpG
dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells. Normally, DNA methylation of promoter
regions inversely correlates with gene expression, except at CpG islands, which
are found at 60% of promoters and are kept free of methylation independent of
their activity state. In cancer cells, promoter CpG islands become
hyper-methylated, causing silencing of the underlying gene. Intragenic
methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as LINEs and SINCEs in human
DNA and gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes, therefore
inhibiting antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing. Basically, specific
genomic regions associated with distinct DNA methylation patterns are
regulating gene expression profiles and chromatin compartmentalization. In
cancer, one would observe a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA
methylation, causing both genomic instability and deregulation of tissue
specific and imprinted genes in addition to silencing tumor suppressor genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, one would
observe a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation, causing both
genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes in addition
to silencing tumor suppressor genes. Differently methylated regions (DMRs) are
associated with many imprinted genes, including the example of methylation at a
DMR upstream of the H19 gene (aka IC1 – Imprint Control region) acquired in
male germlines. This influences the methylation status of other DMRs including
the IGF2 (insulin-like-growth factor 2) gene through long-range interactions.
In Wilms tumour, biallelic expression of IGF2 has been observed in association
with loss of methylation at a DMR in IGF2, which has been shown to be
methylated on the silent meternal IGF2 allele with a presumptive role of
repression. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>D</span><span>ecitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent currently used to treat Myelodysplastic
syndromes. It functions by inhibiting DNA-methyltransferase, allowing the drug
to be incorporated into DNA strands. It is similar to another demethylating
agent, Azacitidine, which can incorporate into both DNA and RNA strands. They
induce antineoplastic effects via two mechanisms: (1) inhibition of DNA
methyltransferase at low doses causing hypomethylation of DNA and (2) direct
cytotoxicity in abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow through its
incorporation into DNA and RNA at high doses. This results in disassembly of polyribosomes,
defective methylation and acceptor function of transfer RNA and inhibition of
the production of protein. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The reason why epigenetic drugs can alter tumor cells in a way in which
the tumor becomes more susceptible to standard therapy is because epigenetic
changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells
until they are actively erased, at which point they will not return. With this
in mind, one can imagine how such an epigenetic therapy can basically stop
cancer cells from growing; at that point, current chemotherapeutic agents can
simply go in and destroy the remaining, susceptible, non-growing cancer cells
ultimately yielding better outcomes for patients. </p>

<span>These
agents would not be used in any circumstance. For example, they would not be
used during what is known as sensitive periods of development, occurring from
birth to about 6-7 years of age. These are overlapping periods when a child is
particularly sensitive to certain types of stimuli or interaction, leading to a
child to acquire certain abilities such as language, discrimination of sensory
stimuli and mental modeling of his/her environment. One would try avoiding
using any epigenetic agents during such as period, as certain markers (as seen
through either hypo- or hyper-methylation) can be affected. </span></div>
