    <div class="field-value">The DNA methylation is an important mechanism in epigenetic control. DNA methylation has different favorite sites in DNA. One of this is CpG islands,  (or CG islands), that are regions with a high frequency of CpG sites found in 60% of gene promoter region. Methylation of these sites are linked to the expression of gene with hypermethylation status linked to a a silencing of gene. In cancer, methylation control of CpG islands is altered.  In cancer generally an hypermethylation  of promoter of tumor suppressor genes is found leading to silencing those genes.  Generally, we found a global hypomethylation of DNA in cancer respect to normal cells. An other important methylation sites are intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Methylation status of these regions are linked to genome stability. Generally, we know hypomethylation of these regions was linked to a genomic instability with an increase of illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition. The hypomethylation of these regions was found in cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are monoallelically expressed according to the parent of origin and are critical for proper placental and embryonic development. Disruption of methylation patterns at imprinted loci resulting in loss of imprinting (LOI) , this condition is found in Wilm's tumor.The imprinted genes. H19 and insulin-like growth factor 2(IGF2), play   a   major   role   in embryonic and placental growth.

H19 contains a differentially methylated region that is also an 
imprinting control region. This imprinting control region is 
differentially methylated at its CpGs according to parental inheritance.
 Usually, the paternal copy of H19 is methylated and silent while the 
maternal copy is hypomethylated or unmethylated and expressed in the 
offspring cell. Methylation of the H19 promoter is negatively correlated
 with H19 expression.  At the same time as H19 expression decreases, the expression of IGF2, a neighboring gene on chromosome 11, increases. H19 gene is epigenetically controlled via methylation, where 
methylation on or near the vicinity of one allele prevents the 
expression of that allele..The imprinting pattern, preferential maternal allele loss, of H19 increases expression and is related to IGF2 level. Wilms’ tumor, and <i>IGF2</i> LOI is found in the vast majority (90%) of pathological cases</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferaseand is indicated for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).It is a chemical analogue of cytidine, a nucleoside present in DNA and RNA. Cells in the presence of Decitabine incorporate it into DNA during replication and RNA during transcription. The incorporation of Decitabine into DNA or RNA inhibits methyltransferase.Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore 
normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular 
differentiation and proliferation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic drugs altering DNA methylation status with important effects on expression of genes. Epigenetic of drugs are interesting keys of treatment for cancer disease but could lead to a ereditable cell by cell alteration. In younger people , the treatment with epigenetic drugs could lead to germ cells epigenetic alteration that could be ereditated by offspring (sensitive period) in these periods these treatments could be inadvisable<br /></div>
