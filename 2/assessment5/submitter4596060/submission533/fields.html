    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at a CpG islands:<br />The process of methylation consists of adding a methyl group to cytosine or adenine DNA nucleotide. This process occurs everyday at cellular scale and occurs at CpG islands.<br />In cancer research the methylation process attracts interest due to the fact that the CpG islands occur in cluster and when a gene is hypermethylated then it's may become silent, unstable or unable to repair DNA damages. A common scenario is the hypermethylation of a tumor suppressor gene and make this gene silent. <br />At the other hand another process, hypomethylation, can makes the tumor promoter gene more active. The loss of function or/and gain of function favor the appearance of cancer. But it needs more contributing factors for cancer to appear as suggested by the recent advances in tumor microenvironment research. <br />The intergenic region and repeatitive elements ensure chromosome stability and accurate gene expression. The methylation process plays a significant role in insuring chromosomal integrity, the control of this process consists in part of of controlling the DNMT1 process (DNA methyl transferase). Expression of DNMT1 can cause hypomethylation.<br />In cancer the intergenic regions or repetitive elements are often hypomethylated. Hypomethylation on a wide scale causes chromosomal instability, and when it affects a small area (several nucleotides) you have the micro satellite instability (msi) phenomenon. Micro satellites, small tandem repeats, and variable number tandem repeats are "synonyms" and it consists of variable repeats of oligonucleotide sequences. This notion is often mentioned in certain blood, and colon cancer. The use of micro satellite instability in colon cancer allows oncologists to decide whether to give additional treatment under certain conditions.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting refers to monoallelic gene expression, the source (allele) can be paternal or maternal and the basic mechanism is epigenetic. <br />Gene Igf2 is paternally inherited. Imprinted genes exist in clusters and those clusters are joined and controlled by Imprinting control region(ICR). Differentially methylated regions (DMR) in the ICR exhibit methylation activity that modulate the effect of imprinted genes. Activating and dectivating histone modifications are also found at DMRs and they represent the pattern of Dna methylation. Igf2 has 3 DMRs.(0,1,2)<br />The methylation pattern of the maternal allele is expressed through Dmr0. The IGF2/H19 DMR has a binding site for CTFG, a transcriptional repressor. When CFTG is bound H19DMR is unmethylated, and by doing so it silences the maternal allele expression.<br />In Wilm's tumor we have a defective WT-1 gene that encodes a transcriptional repressor of IGF2; a defective and abnormal overexpression of IGF2 leads to a loss of imprinting (LOI). This condition permits the development of abnormal embryonal kidney tissue (Wilm's tumor).<br />Loss of imprinting can result in an activation of a silent and critical growth promoting gene such as IGF2/H19 through hypomethylation or silencing a growth-inhibitory gene by hypermethylation. Those events contribute to the tumorigenesis process.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It reactivates epigenetically the tumor suppressor genes by hypomethylating those genes. The exact mechanism is thought to be through epigenetic alterations and apoptosis induction. Reactivating the tumor suppressor genes and inhibiting the methylation process can requilibrate the epigenetic process that is skewed in the aging process. The use of decitabine in MDS, a condition found commonly in elderly patients, reflects this concept.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can destabilize the genome,and(or) inhibits DNA repair. Those processes can synergize the effect of DNA damaging agents (radiation or the platinum drug family). In some tumors where we have a defective gene involved in the control of a critical step,i.e once a tumor is excised or treated with chemotherapy we can use agents that reactivate the tumor suppressor p 53 gene. In other case, the presence of p53 mutation carries a bad prognostic sign (Multiple myeloma,...) the addition of hypomethylating agents reactivating p53 activity can contribute to a better response. The use of hypomethylating agent in such case can prolong the disease free interval in addition to the use of "microbiome" agent that abrogate the GVHD reaction (Graft versus host disease).<br />Sensitive periods of development are periods that allows the transfer of environmental informations to subsequent generations or reprogramming in epigenetic language.<br />Such periods are: the blastocyst period, before and after implantation period, midgestation period, and early differentiation period. Use of epigenetic modifying agents in such period can perturb the fine epigenetic balance of the subject. It can result in long term side effects for the individual. First do no harm sometimes is a preferable choice.</div>
