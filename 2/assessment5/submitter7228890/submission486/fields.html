    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands usually are not methylated. In cancer cells promoter CpG islands are hypermethylated, which leads to their silencing.<br />Disruption of DNA methilation at CpG islands can deactivate tumor supressor genes, influence on genes that regulate cell division,  DNA repair, cell cycle, cell adhesion, apoptosis and angiogenesis providing selective advantages of cancer cells. The main functions of methylation are to repress "transcriptional noise" from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription and direct RNA splicing. Disrupted DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements (hypomethylation) increases genomic instability and activates proto-oncogenes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint control region of  H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated on the maternal
allele. CTCF connect with it and the enhancers will act on H19 wich leads to silencing of Igf2 for the maternal allele and absence of the expression. ICR is methylated on the paternal allele (CTCF is not connected to ICRand is not inhibited). Enhancers can act on IGF2,which is expressed
from the pattern allele. Hypermmethylation of maternal allele leades to overexpression of Igf2 from maternal and paternal alleles because loss of imprinting. Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster happens in the very early stage of cancer and is characterized as preneoplastic changes in the tissue. This cluster acts as oncogene, and responsible for growth promoting which leads to tumor formation in early childhood.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agent (de novo<span> methyltransferases inhibitor</span>) decreases DNA methylation by blocking of the appropriate enzyme. Antitumor effect is connected with activation of gene expression decreasing of hypermethylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altered DNA methylation (epigenetic changes) can be inherited by daughter and granddaughter cells which endure the effect and those cells can become susceptible for standard hemotherapy. The sensitive period is the period when emplementation of the drug can effect normal processes of formation of epigenetic marks and epigenetic regulation.<span> Sensitive periods of development are early embrionic period before implantation and gestation. In some cases it would be inadvisable because epigenetic changes caused by the drugs can be inherited by the future children. But if the disease which should be treated is threaten to survival of the person the desision should be made in favor of the treatment </span><br /></div>
