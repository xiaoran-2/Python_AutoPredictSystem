    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state and are found in about 60% of promoters. In cancer cells CpG island become hypermethylated, causing the regulated genes to become inactive.[1] CpG island shores, the 2kb regions surrounding the CpG also become hypermethylated. [2] It seems that tumors use DNA methylation during progression, this may because DNA methylation results in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, by hypermethylating the promoter CpG island.[3] Repetitive sequences, such as satellite repeats and the remains of retro-viral sequence insertions, are the normal sites of intragenic methylation. [4] Directed hypomethylation at satellite repeats allows the cancer adapt to changing environments and occurs later in carcinogenesis. [5]<br /><br />[1] <span>Hassler MR, Egger G.

answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>

        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value">The paternally expressed IncRNa AIR can determine insulin-like growth factor 2 (igf2r) expression by targeting the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a to the Slc22a3 promoter.[1] In Wilm's Tumor, a form of kidney cancer, there is a loss of DNA methylation at a DMR in IGF2, which is influenced by the methylation of imprint control regions in the upstream of the H19 gene and is acquired in the male germline [2]. DMRs control the expression of H19 and IGF2 genes,[3] and in Wilm's tumour there is a somatic lack of imprinting; which is caused by IGF-2 activation and H19 silencing.[4] THis tumor has a loss of imprinting and is hypomethylated; this promotes tumorigenesis and allows adaptation since repressors like DMR0 are silenced at the same time.[5]<br /><br />[1]<span>Hassler MR, Egger G.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agent, which means that it hypomethylates DNA [1] and this in turn can have an anti-tumor effect because tumors sometimes rely on hypermethylation of large portions of DNA to silence tumor suppressor genes.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome becuase DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. [1] This is why DNA methylation has been referred to as part of our epigenetic memory [2]. It has previously been shown that it can take months for mouse cells to recover global DNA methylation levels following treatment with a DNA demethylating agent [3].<br />Sensitive periods of development are periods of global hypomethylation and remethylation which most often take place in premordial germ cells and early embryos.[4] Changes in epigenetic marks maintained by DNA methylation can result in a broad range of diseases ranging from asthma to reproductive disorders, therefore treating patients during these periods would not advisable.
