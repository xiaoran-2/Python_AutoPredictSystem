    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG sites are associated with silencing of the gene. In cancer cells the CpG islands are more likely to be hyper methylated. The CpG hypermethylation are found in the promotor region of the tumor suppressor genes. That leads to epigenetic downregulation of tumor suppressor gene. In normal cells DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements ensures maintainance of chromosome structure and genome stability. In cancer cells there is a hypomethylation in the intergenic regions and repetative regions. The results of hypomethyaltion depends on where the hypomethylation takes place. Hypomethylation in intergeneic region disrupts genetic instability by illegitimate reciprocal translocation. The repeats can also get activated due to hypomethylation causing activation of neighboring regions resulting in trancriptional abberation. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cell, in paternal allele the imprint control region is methylated the enhancers can interact with Igf2 cluster region thus activating Igf2. In normal cell, in the maternal allele the imprint control region in unmethylated region thus the enhancers would bind to the H19 region resulting in silencing of Igf2. In wilm's tumor there is a loss of imprinting due hyper methylation region of imprint control region in maternal allele, this activates the IGF2 in maternal allele which is normally silenced in normal cell. The disruption of imprinting results in double dosage of IGF2, which is  growth factor, the abnormality of growth factor contributes in tumerogenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNMTi (DNa Methyl Transferase inhibitors). Decitabine is nucleoside analos, they get incorprate into DNA during replication. Decitabine binds irreversibly bind to Dna methyl transferase resulting in DNA hypomethylation. Since this mechanism depends on DNA replication, and during cancer cells, cell divides more rapidly resulting in higher toxicity in cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since DNA methylation are epigenetic regulations and are mitotically inherited any alternation in DNA methylation will be maintained after cell divisions.  Sensitive period are the time periods when environment can alter the epigenetic makeup. During development there are mainly two sensitive periods: a) period from primordial germ cell to production of mature sperm cell or egg cells and b) early preimplantation and post implantation period.  It is inadvisable to treating patient during sensitive periods because these are the period of active reprogramming of epigenetic marks, during these time period the active genetic marks are laid down and removed. So altering DNA methylation during sensitive period can result in creating abnormality in maintaining the epigenetic marks required for genetic stabilty and proper cellular regulation required for survival of the cell.</div>
