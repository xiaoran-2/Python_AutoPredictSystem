    <h1>Submission 353 from Anon (session_user_id: 9181e929980c60bb07f8b51e68a9f969b2bcf622)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is essential for cell life, is mitotically heritable and helps maintain genomic stability.  DNA methylation occurs in intergenic regions and repetetive elements to silence gene expression. Blocked or lack of methylation in intergenic regions and repetetive elements promotes genomic instabilty and may cause DNA transcriptional errors resulting in cancer.  While not normally methylated,  DNA methylation occurring at CpG islands alters and silences gene expression (ie. required for X inactivation). </div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In the paternally imprinted imprint control region H19/Igf2, methylation spreads to the H19 promoter on the paternal allele causing downstream enhancers to activate lgf2.  The maternal allele has blocked expression of lgf2 due to the addition of a CFCF insulator protein.  Loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 causes Wilm’s tumour and disrupted expression of the H19/Igf2 imprint control region inhibits tumor suppressing genes thus causing cancer.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine is an enzyme inhibitor drug that demethylates DNA. It can have an anti-tumour effect by inhibiting enzymes that attach methyl groups to histones which silence surrounding tumour suppressing genes.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Sensitive periods occur during germ cell and early development so I would avoid epigenetic drug treatments for pregnant women and adolescents in order to maintain epigenetic inheritance and patient fertility.  Using DNA demethylating drugs may help to activate silenced tumour suppressing genes and enable better drug response in cancer therapy.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
