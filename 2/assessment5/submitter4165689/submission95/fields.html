    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>
















</p><p><span>The
DNA methylation is an important factor for the genomic stability, however in
cancer cells this process is disrupted. In normal cell the promotor-associated-CpG islands are kept
free of methylation allowing for the expression of the gene. In cancer CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, which causes silencing of the tumor suppressor
genes leading to disrupted process of apoptosis and DNA repair.  Secondly, a </span>hypomethylation of
repeats and intergenic intervals 
is observed, which normally tend to be hypermethylated.  The hypomethylation leads to genomic
instability causing illegitimate recombination between repeats  (deletions, insertions, reciprocal
translocations), activation of repeats and transposition , activation of cryptic
promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>An
alterated methylation pattern (hypo- or hypermethylation) at ICRs  may disrupt the imprinting and thus, result
in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth
promoting genes. As an example we may take the H19/Igf2 cluster. Normally ICR
at the paternal allele is methylated leading to the activity of enhancers
stimulating the expression of Igf2. The maternal allele ICR is hypomethylated
causing the H19 expression and unabling the expression of Igf2. In Wilm’s
tumour both alleles are hypermethylated causing the loss of imprinting and thus
overexpression of Igf2 (a double dose in comparison with normal cell). The Igf2
is a growth factor, so its excessive expression stimulates the growth of the
tumour.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is used in treating cancer since it influences its
epigenetics. It belongs to a class of DNMT-inhibitors.  It leads to DNA-demethylation via
irreversibly binding DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA as a
nuceloside analogue. The anti-tumour effect is probably caused by the
demethylation of the CpG-islands and in this way activating the silenced tumor
suppressor genes leading to control of the cell growth and apoptosis .</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drugs
altering the DNA methylation are causing changes in the epigenetic marks
reestablishing normal methylation pattern in cells. These epigenetic changes,
“normal non-cancerous methylation patterns” are passed between the cell
generations during cell division. Thus, if a drug leads to a “normal”
DNA-methylation pattern in a cell, this normal pattern is inherited by the next
generations of cells, which explains why the effects last beyond the treatment
period. However, since the drugs act globally not only on the tumor cells, this
type of therapy would not be advisable for treating patients during the
sensitive periods. These sensitive periods are the moments, when the epigenetic
marks are set:  during the
early embryogenesis and germ cell development. That is why young adults and
pregnant women should not be treated with this type of medication.</p></div>
