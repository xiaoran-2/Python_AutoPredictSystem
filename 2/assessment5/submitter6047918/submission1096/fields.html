    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation generally at the promoter regions inhibits the recruitment of any enzymes nececassry for transcription. But at the CpG islands in The promoter of the gene DNA there is no methylation to be seen even if the gene is transciptionally unactive. In cancer the CpG islands are highly methylated which is off signl for the gene. This causes changes in expression patterns of the genes such as transcriptional noise etc. which can lead to cancer. In normal functioning DNA DNA methylation also occurs at repetitive DNA which causes interference in the DNA reading such as satellite repeats which are long non coding repetitive DNA and retroviral insertions or transposons also which can be interfering with normal gene transcription. the methylation of cpg islands also spreads the methyation to other parts of he gene. Also imprinting of genes is lost. When these intergenic region are not methylated they are free to recombine whith other genes not necessarily on the same chromosome which can lead to recombination among non compatible chromosomes . Also such inactive regions can be activated which can cause them to makes copies and transpose among chromosomes such as transposons. this also leads to increased deletions and insertions in the chromosomes</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer the there is loss of imprinting of the genes due to changes in methylation patterns in the gene. In Igf2 gene the paternal gene is methylated so it cannnot be transcibed. imprint control region is imprinted on the paternal allele and not in the maternal allele. in maternal ctcf binds to the promoter and the enhncers act on the H19 and igf2 is silenced. But in paternal it is not and the enhancers enhance the igf2. in wilms tumour there is hyper methylation on both the alleles and this caues igf2 to be expressed from both the alleles and no H19 from any allele. Igf2 causes tumour early as it very good for growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a dna demythlating agent which reduces hyper methylation generally seen in cancer cells. It reduces the dna methylation in cancer cells. it is appparenly uneffective on normal cell as they dont have so high no of dna methylation but it reduces the proliferation of tumour cell. In cancer the cpg island in promoters are highly methylated which causes inhibiton of importatnt growth related genes in the body such as igf2. the drug reduces such over methylation in the genes and acivate the genes deacitvated in the cancer phenotype. as the mechanics of the cancer cells is different compared to the normal cells only cnacer cells are affected wherease<br />normal cells seem to be unaffected. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dna methylation palys a important role in transcription which leads to incativation of repeptitive desruptive DNA wherease promoting trnascription of necessarygenes. They are generally transfered between cells through reproduction and cell division wher only point of removal of these marks are during gamete and embryo develeopment. changing these marks changes how all the progenitors of the cells rather than convetional gene therpy which affects only the cells in that generation affected by the the chemical. a sensetive peroid is where these marks are changed as seen above. </div>
