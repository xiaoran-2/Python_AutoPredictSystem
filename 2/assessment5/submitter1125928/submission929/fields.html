    <h1>Submission 929 from Anon (session_user_id: 9dd23846c71dd61e13f7a34a0459ea936cdd1226)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">According to Prof. Blewitt's lecture 7-9, decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). During cell division, decitabine binds and permanently inactivates DNA methyltransferase as the latter attempts to transfer the methylation state of the parent cell's DNA to the daughter cell. Since cancer cells replicate much faster than other cells, they are believed to be disproportionately affected by the disruption of methylation during cell division. So, at relatively small doses, decitabine is able to disrupt methylation of cancer cells (and thus disrupt tumor growth), while normally dividing cells are much less affected.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands (areas of heavy concentration of CpG dinucleotides, found in perhaps 60% of promoters) are generally unmethylated: the cell works to keep them unmethylated regardless of what else is happening at the promoter site. (This is in contrast to what happens in non-CpG areas of promoters, where methylation generally corresponds to gene suppression.) <br /><br />In cancer cells, though, CpG islands in promoters are generally hypermethylated, which has the effect of preventing transcription of the genes controlled by such promoters. These are often tumor-suppressing genes; thus, hypermethylation of a CpG island in a promoter of a tumor suppressor removes an inhibitor to growth of the cancer.<br /><br />In normal cells, regions between genes (intergenic regions) and the areas of repetitive elements are generally methylated. In cancer cells, though, these areas are generally unmethylated. In the cancer cells, these anomalously unmethylated regions show signs of karyotic instability: that is, they are subject to line up incorrectly along repeats for recombination; they are prone to increased numbers of repeats; they can create transpositions that disruptively migrate elsewhere in the genome; cryptic promoters may start or stop transcription of nearby genes inappropriately; and arbitrary insertions and deletions may occur. Thus, the phrase "genomic instability" in describing the effects of intergenic/repetitive hypomethylation would be better described as replicative chaos, which is a hallmark of cancer cells.<br /><br />Therapies that attempt to reduce the hypermethylation of CpG islands in tumor-suppressing genes risk exacerbating the intergenic chaos, while therapies that attempt to reduce the latter make the hypermethylative suppression of tumor suppressors worse.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The problem in Wilm's tumor is that a gene imprinted for parent-of-origin-only expression is disrupted.<br /><br />The imprint control region (ICR) for the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated, which silences H19 but allow enhancers to act on Igf2, which is expressed. (This is true for both normal and cancerous cells.) <br /><br />Handling of the maternal allele, though, differs between normal and cancerous cells. In the normal cell, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing the CTCR insulator to seat itself in the ICR.  This allows the enhancers cause the expression of H19, but Igf2 is silenced. However, in the cancerous cell, both the ICR and H19 are hypermethylated, which causes maternal Igf2 to be expressed and H19 to be silenced. Thus, imprinting is lost through hypermethylation of the maternal allele, and both alleles act the same way at Igf2/H19.<br /><br />Since both alleles now express the growth-promoting Igf2, the cell receives a double dose of it, and begins to grow abnormally, causing the childhood cancer known as Wilm's tumor.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenomic state (e.g, DNA methylation, histone-residue methylation and acetylation, etc.) is actively copied from parent cell to daughter cell at the time of cell division, and is thus generally heritable for the life of the organism (although certain changes can and do occur). Thus, a change in DNA methylation state has enduring effect because it's passed from a cell to all its descendent cells.  (Also, methylation involves a strong, disruption-resistant covalent bond.)  <br /><br />A "sensitive period" with respect to the epigenome is a time where the epigenome is undergoing large-scale modification. There are two such periods in embryonic development where much methylation is erased: one just before gastrulation, and another during primordial germ-cell development. As Prof. Blewitt's Week 5 lectures pointed out, the entire pre-adult period in humans where sperm and egg cells are maturing can also be considered a sensitive period.<br /><br />The thesis of epigenetic treatment of cancer is that the epigenetic mechanisms of cancer cells can be targeted (e.g, through the cells' rapid mitosis or even their malfunctioning epigenetic mechanisms) by therapies that disproportionately affect cancer cells relative to other, epigenetically stable cells. Attempting such therapies during periods of normally rapid cell growth (embryonic growth, or childhood), or at any time when the epigenome is not stable due to large-scale revision invites unpredictable effects.<br /></div>
