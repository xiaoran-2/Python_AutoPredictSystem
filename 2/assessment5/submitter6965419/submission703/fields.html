    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic control is there to assist on the
interpretation of the genetic code, like punctuation marks. In the NORMAL
tissue DNA methylation (and histone modifications) helps out with the
expression pattern - most genes are regulated on a tissue or state of
development dependent manner. DNA methylation is used for silencing the genes
not necessary at the time and place. In normal tissue the transposable elements
and intergenic regions (and introns in the gene) are usually methylated for the
sake of genomic stability.</p>

<p>In case of CANCER there are changes in gene expression
compared to any of normal tissues in an adult organism. These changes can be a
result of a mutation in a gene (for example mutation in a conding sequence of a
tumor suppressor gene causing loss-of-function or a mutation in some
transcription factor binding site in a promoter) area can cause , but at least
just as often the change is epigenetic. Heavy (hyper) methylation of tumor
suppressor promoter can lead to its silencing. This means DNA repair, apoptosis
and growth/cell cycle control genes are selectively switched off. </p>

<p>Coupled with this specific hypermethylation, there is
usually an overall decrease of DNA methylation on the global level (genome wide
hypomethylation). While intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated
in the normal tissue, in cancer they become progressively hypomethylated. This
results in repeat elements becoming active: a genomic instability that can
cause large translocations/insertions/duplications of DNA. Active transposable elements
also can make neighboring genes becoming aberrantly active. Hypomethylation can
activate (onco)genes with CpG poor promoters. </p>

<p><span>Different tumors have different dependences, they are
context dependent (some are driven by hypermethylation of tumor suppressors –
then depletion of DNA methylation suppresses tumor growth. Others are driven by
instability and oncogene activation because of poor CpG promoter – they are
proliferating faster in depletion of DNA methylation.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region for H19/Igf2
has a very clever architecture. The maternal allele ICR is bound by CTCF and
this „protects“the ICR from being methylated. A downstream enhancer is able to
bind the regulation region of H19 gene and promote transcription – H19 is being
expressed from maternal allele (the on with a unmethylated ICR).</p>

<p>On the contrary – allele with paternal
origin is methylated and the downstream enhancer is now unable to promote H19,
instead it loops even further forward and promotes Igf2 (<span>insulin-like <b>growth factor</b> 2)</span><span>. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, a target for
cancerous changes in epigenetic methylation pattern. In case of cancer (Wilm’s
tumor) the maternal chromosome ICR also gets methylated, resulting
paternal-like epigenotype and transcription activation of Igf2 gene. In this
case expression of H19 (which is the opposite of Igf2, slowing growth) decreases
dramatically – at least twenty-fold). </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (like <span>Azacitidine<b>)</b></span> is a DNA-demethylating e.g. hypomethylating agent. It is
inhibiting <b><span>DNA
methyltransferase </span></b><b>(DNMT)</b><b>.</b><span> Decitabine is a </span><b>cytidine</b><span> <b>analog</b>, only</span> the carbon is replaced by nitrogen at the
5-position on the cytosine ring. When it is
incorporated into DNA strand and DNMTs binds and tries to
methylate it, the methylation fails (due to different chemical properties of
carbon and nitrogen, e.g. number of free electrons). So DNMT is irreversibly stuck
to the decitabine, which causes depletion of cellular DNMT levels and decrease of
methylation events occuring in the cell. Several lines of preclinical and
clinical evidence suggest that, since the altered methylation level sustaines
after cells are no longer exposed to <span>decitabine, there must be an additional mechanism how it is </span>induce epigenetic reprogramming.</p>

<p><span>Decitabine has been shown to improve progression-free survival in
patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes </span><i>versus</i><span> best supportive care</span>. Average
methylation level is decreased by 11.2% in the decitabine group of patients and
increased by 20.1% in the supportive-care group.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation also alter
expression pattern of a multitude of genes. If DNMT is unable to methylate its
targets, then the genes previously silenced come back to life, producing
anti-proliferation proteins or triggering apoptosis when needed. If we inhibit
methylation in cancer, we alter the
activity of critical genes in cancer cells that drive their growth and survival.</p>

<p><span>But since epigenetic therapies
may affect the structure of chromatin </span><span>(the
complex of DNA and proteins that forms chromosomes), it could cause side
effects over a long period. Cancer diagnostic markers are getting better, cancer
can be found in a pretty early state already, and this means we should consider
long-term effects of the drugs. </span></p><p><span>These drugs are also dangerous to germ cells/embryos
if treatment is during a periconceptional period or early pregnancy. When the epigenetic
reprogramming takes place e.g. early blastocyst/pre-implantation period (but
also during primordial germ cell development) the changes in methylation enzyme
can cause serious developmental deficits.</span></p></div>
