    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands are usually unmethylated whereas in cancer they are methylated. The methylation of CpG islands can lead to silencing of gene expression, and in cancer this occurs in, for example, promoters of tumor supressor genes.<br />The intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are normally mehylated. In cancer cells they are unmethylated leading to genomic instability, thus having illegitimate recombination, transposition, etc..</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can cause genes that are usually imprinted to be either expressed or silenced from both parental alleles. Genes that are usually imprinted are related to cell growth, wich is a very important factor in cancer. The H19/Igf2 cluster the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternaln allele. When it's unmethylated (maternal allele) CTCF bind to an insulator blocking the enhancers action on the Igf2 gene, so they act on H19 and Igf2 will be silent. On the paternal allele the enhancers can act on the Igf2 since there is nothing blocking it's action, the methylation of the ICR doesn't allow the binding of CTCF. On Wilm's tumor you have hypermethylation of the ICR in the maternal allele so there is an increase in the expression of Igf2 wich promotes growth. Since Igf2 promotes growth, the disruption of this cluster favors cancer cell to grow.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine it's a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor, they act as nucleoside anologues binding irrevesibly to the DNMTs. When they are incorporated to the cell during replication and the DNMT comes to copy the methylation status, they are bind in an irreversible manner, an can no longer act on anywhere else, so the amount of methylation of the DNA is reduced. Since they are replication dependent, and cancer cells divide more frequently than normal cells, thet will be more affected by this drug.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation it's mitotycally heritable, thus, any modification is passed to other generations. Sensitive period are those in wich any alteration during this time generates an effect on the organism. This sensitive periods occur in early development and during germ cell development, wich are periods where reprogramming of the epigenetic status it's taking place and any alteration in the organism can lead to change in the epigetics. So this needs to be properly controlled, an treatments during these periods can cause not wanted effect.</div>
