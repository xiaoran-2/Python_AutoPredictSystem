    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Normally, DNA methylation at CpG islands operates to silence nearby genes.<br /></li><li>In cancer, there is often specific methylation of CpG islands near tumor suppressor genes (silencing of genes that would normally block cancerous changes).</li><li>DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer by silencing tumor suppressor genes or by silencing suppressors of tumor activating genes.</li><li>Normally, repetitive elements are fastidiously kept in check by DNA methylation and there are suppressive methylation marks in intergenic regions, as well.</li><li>Disruption of DNA methylation marks in repetitive elements allows for expression of cryptic promoters and upregulated expression of nearby genes and the translocation (jumping, insertion) of repetitive elements to other locations in the genome where they may disrupt normal gene expression.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Normally, the paternal allele is methylated, expression of H19 blocked, and Igf2 is expressed (enhancers enhance expression of Igf2. <br /></li><li>Normally, the maternal allele is not methylated, the ICR binds with an 'insulator' and H19 is expressed (rather than Igf2).<br /></li><li>In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele has the methylation status of the paternal allele and Igf2 is expressed from both alleles (double dose), and neither allele expresses H19.</li><li>Igf2 promotes growth: this contributes to cancer via less contrained growth.<br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is described in the article as being a demethylating agent.</li><li>It is a cytocine analog that inhibits DNA methyltransferases and reactivates suppressed (hypermethylated) tumor suppressor genes, in vitro. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18425818" title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18425818">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18425818</a></li><li>It is a proposed treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome, a precursor to acute myelogenous leukemia, characterized by hypermethylation. Tumor suppressor activity is thought to be at least partially restored. It may also have apoptotic activity (altered cells shutdown and die).</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation are mitotically inheritable, persisting in cells and daughter cells until erased. Thus altering DNA methylation status may be therapeutic for an extended period of time beyond the time of drug treatment.</li><li>A sensitive period is one when epigenetic reprogramming takes place.</li><li>There are two sensitive periods of development: 1) when tissue-specific marks are being laid down during embryogenesis during early development and 2) when parental imprinting marks are being established during primordial germ cell development, including The later may include girls prior to puberty where epigenetic marks are being slowly laid down.</li><li>Treatment of girls (epigenetic marks in eggs continues in childhood) and pregnant women (early embryonic development, primordial germ cell development) would be inadvisable. Altering e.g. folate status, needed to set up epigenetic marks, or exposure to agents of all sorts that influence epigenetic marks in women trying to conceive would be inadvisable.</li></ul></div>
