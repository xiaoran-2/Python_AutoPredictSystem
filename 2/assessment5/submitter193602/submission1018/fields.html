    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation works on two different targets: there are CpG islands and intergenic and repetitive elements.<br /><br />The CpG islands are found in 60% of the gene promoters and are usually unmethylated. When methylated, the corresponding gene is usually silenced, and that is the function of CpG islands (silencing of genes for example in X-chromosome inactivation, imprinting or tissue-specific). In cancer the mechanism breaks, some CpG islands become hypermethylated, resulting in loss of imprinting and deactivating tumor-suppressing genes. The cancer hypermethylation is locus-specific, which means that it happens only to some CpG islands in some specific promoters, which may differ depending on the cancer type.<br /><br />The second place for DNA-methylation to occur is in intergenic regions and repetetive elements. Usually these places are methylated to maintain genomic stability. Intergenic regions may sometimes contain promoter-like regions causing RNA Polymerase to bind and start the transcription, which can alter the transcription of the main gene. Also the intergenic regions at different chromosome may sometimes contain the similar sequences, which may result in incorrect recombination of chromosomes if unmethylated and accessible to splicing enzymes. The repetetive elements are also kept methylated because otherwise they would copy themselves into unpredictabe places in the DNA (sometimes inside genes), which is clearly mutagenic. In cancer this mechanism also usually breaks, resulting in hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetetive elements in the whole genome (unlike the hypermethylation of CpG islands), resulting in the genomic instability in all described ways.<br /><br />The  CpG islands hypermethylation and genome-wide hyphomethylation is supposed to be stochastic, the cause can be the loss of fidelity or mutation of methylation/demethylation enzymes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">One of the way of epigenetic carcinogenesis is via loss of imprinting. An example is the Igf2 gene expressed on the H19/Igf2 cluster on paternal-only allele.<br />There's an imprint control region in the cluster, which is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.<br />On the maternal allele the insulator protein CTCF binds to the unmethylated imprint control region. The region is between the Igf2 gene and the enchancers needed for the expression of the Igf2. The CTCF protein insulates the Igf2 from the enchancers, deactivating the Igf2 expression on the maternal allele. Instead the enchancers start working on another gene, H19, which is a long non-coding RNA.<br />On the paternal allele the CTCF protein cannot bind to the imprint control region as it's methylated. So there's no insulator and the enchancers access the Igf2 resulting in its expression (the H19 is not expressed in that case).<br />In case of cancer the imprint control region on both alleles is methylated, hence the Igf2 is overexpressed and the H19 is lossed.<br />The underexpressed H19 (usually suppresses growth) and the overexpressed Igf2 (usually promotes growth)<span> often results in cancer.<br />In 50% cases of Wilm's tumor the Igf2 is overexpressed.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug supposed to treat some kinds of cancer.<br />It's mechanism of action is to inhibit DNA methylation by blocking the <span>DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) protein. This is done to reactivate the epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes. As a result of DNMT inhibition the methylation marks are lost (and the tumor suppressing genes are reactivated) during cell replication, and as far as the cancer cells are dividing a lot more than normal cells, they are effected more, and this mechanism is supposed to be effective against the tumor growth.<br />That's probably not the only effect of </span>Decitabine. In fact, it was shown that Decitabine causes the formation of double strand breaks in human cancer cells, which causes the cell to die.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The current FDA-approved DNMT inhibitors (Azacitidine and Decitabine) can have enduring effects on the epigenome since they incorporate into DNA while the cell is dividing (the product of their metabolism, <span>azacytosine, can substitute for cytosine in the cell replication process). They'll stay in the DNA of the new (replicated) cell, and also some methylation marks are lost in this cell and all it's child cells. Hence it's inadvisable to take these drugs in the sensitive periods.<br />The sensitive period is a period while extensive epigenetic reprogramming is happening, so at that time the cells being reprogrammed are mostly sensitive to </span>environmental<span> factors. There are 2 sensitive periods: the early embryonic development and the germ cell development (happens up to the age of 12 years in girls).<br />As far as these periods are mostly sensitive to factors for the whole organism (in case of germ cells it's important for an offspring organism), it's inadvisable to take DNMT inhibitors in these periods, as it may cause incorrect epigenetic reprogramming.</span></div>
