    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal tissue, the
level of methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is higher
than in CpG islands. While methylation at promoters usually mean silencing, CpG
islands in promoters usually kept free of this epigenetic mark, independently
of their activity state. DNA methylation is an epigenetic silencing mark and it
is related to the formation of a more condensed chromatin structure,
heterochromatin. This structure obstructs the binding of the transcription
factors to the DNA, ensuring the silencing of genes and preventing the
transposition of repetitive elements and the illegitimate recombination.</p>

<p>In cancer, the global
level of methylation decreases as you progress from a normal tissue through to
a metastatic tissue. And at the same time, methylation at some CpG islands
increases. This fact alters the expression pattern of the genes whose promoter
region has change the methylation status, and it is especially relevant if they
are suppressor tumor genes. In this same way, the unmethylation of repetitive
elements can induce genomic instability, because repetitive element methylation
silence retrotransposons and prevents its jump across the genome. All in all, the change of this epigenetic mark conducts to an overexpression of some genes, the silencing of some other genes, genome instability and altered nuclear architecture, features related to a wide type of cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is
usually paternally imprinted. </p>

<p>The ICR in the maternal
allele is unmethylated and so, the CTCF insulator protein can bind it. CTCF
protein insulates Igf2 gene from the downstream enhancers, avoiding its
expression. In this way, these enhancers act over H19 gene, inducing its
expression. </p>

<p><span>Conversely, in the
paternal allele the ICR is methylated and the CTCF protein cannot bind it. This
fact allows the downstream enhancers act over Igf2 gene, favoring its expression.
At the same time, the methylation mark is not only present in the ICR but also
in the promoter region of H19 gene, which promote the silencing of this gene.  </span></p>

<p>Altogether, you get a
dose of H19 from your maternal allele and a dose of Igf2 from your paternal
allele.</p>

<p><span>When the ICR of the
maternal allele is also methylated, what you get is a double dose of Igf2, a
growth factor and this fact induces the Wilm’s tumor formation. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogue and so, it can be incorporated into DNA. Decitabine binds irreversibly to DNMTs avoiding DNA methylation. Given that it works when incorporated to DNA, the drug is DNA replication dependent. Thus, cancer cells that are more actively dividing, will be more severely affected than normal cells. Although the mechanism of action is still unclear, it seems to be effective in malignancies which are dependent on CpG islands hypermethylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Maternal and paternal epigenetic marks are
cleared and reprogramming during primordial germ cell development and early
development. The repetitive elements maintain a high level of methylation
throughout these two periods of epigenetic reprogramming and the imprinted
genes undergo reprogramming in the PGC development state.</p>

<p>Periods of epigenetic reprogramming are
sensitive periods and alterations of these normal processes result in epigenetic
abnormalities, among them altered DNA methylation marks. Changes in DNA
methylation pattern can affect to multitude of genes, with different effects in
different types cells.Given that DNA methylation is heritable through division, aberrant methylated marks will be also present in the offspring of the cell that suffered this alteration. If a treatment can alter epigenetic marks, should be not used during sensitive periods due to the long lasting effects that may produce. </p></div>
