    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:

    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation at CpG islands can affect or modulate expression of related genes in normal cells, normally but not necessarily silencing. </div><div>While in cancer cells, the methylation pattern of CpG islands is aberrant comparing with normal cells, e.g.,the CpG islands can be hypermethylated in a locus specific manner.</div><div>This can contribute to the progression of cancer,e.g.,the hypermethylation of the CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes can inhibit their expression, hence promote cancer progression.</div><div><br /></div><div>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements normally serve to establish and maintain chromatin structures, including maintainence of genomic integrity and protect the genome from transposable elements.</div><div>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation is also aberrant in cancer cells comparing with normal cells. Generally, there are genomic hypomethylation of CpG sites of these regions in cancer cells, which can lead to genomic instability and activation of genes which may contribute to the progression of cancer.</div><div>Besides, DNA methylation can interact with other epigenetic marks such as histone modifications and play a role in cancer.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The ICR of the paternal H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated in normal cells, which blocks binding of the transcript factor CTCF, hence releases the downstream enhancers from blocking by CTCF. Those enhancers thereby could access and activate the expression of Igf2.</div><div>While in the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, thus allows the binding of CTCF and subsequent insulation of the downstream enhancers and Igf2. In this circumstance, those enhancers would act on H19, leading to the transcription of H19 instead of Igf2.<br /></div><div>In Wilm's tumour, there is loss of imprinting in H19/Igf2 cluster. The ICRs are hypermethylated in both paternal and maternal alleles, which lead to the overexpression of Igf2 and silencing of H19. The dysfunction of the important growth factor Igf2 is involved in the tumorigenesis of Wilm's tumor.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine is a cytidine analog molecule.As a DNA methylation inhibitor, it can function as a hypomethylation agent by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</div><div>When applied to patients, decitabine can lead to cell toxic effect at high dosage, and cause DNA demethylation at relatively low dosage. Since it fuctions by inhibiting DNMT, the demethylation effect is cell division dependent, other than an active demethylation process.</div><div>In tumour cells, some tumour suppressor genes can possibly be silenced by hypermethylation of related CpG islands, hence the DNA demethylation effect of decitabine might lead to reactivation of those tumour suppressor genes and allow them to fulfill their antineoplastic function.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is a kind of epigenetic marks that can be inherited to the daughter cell during mitosis. In another word, the alterations of DNA methylation patterns can be maintained among cell generations. Therefore, drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects. During the life cycle of human and many other mammals, the DNA methylation patterns of different genomic elements will experience different time course of changes. For example, except the IAPs, the majority of genome will be demethylated and then re-methylated during early embryonic development and germ-line development, while the imprinted gene will maintain their DNA methylation patterns during early development and undergo specific reprogramming in germ-line. During these sensitive perioid, the epigenetic marks of DNA methylation, are sensitive to environmental factor and cellular conditions. From zygote to blastocyst and from primordial germ cells to gametes are the two most sensitive periods of DNA methylation in normal life cycles. Since artificial interference of the former one may lead to abnormal embryogenesis, and the interference of the later one may lead to abnormal spermatogenesis/oogenesis, resulting in long-term sequences including fertility problems and offspring healthy issues, it would be inadvisable to treat patients during those sensitive periods.</div></div>
