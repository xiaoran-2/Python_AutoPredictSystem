    <h1>Submission 931 from Anon (session_user_id: 29197fdca8044389f4d973ccf73ad01f9c12d94c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating drug, means that hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase..<br />The methylation of DNA silences tumor supressor genes, and normally the hypomethylated tumor supressor genes are active and protecting the cell from continuous division.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />Epimutations are reversible, mitotically heritable, epigenetic changes are maintained during cell division until they are actively erased with chemotharapy, and when erased ,they don't get back.<br />During the Sensitive periods there is active remodelling and reprogramming of the<br />epigenome- two major periods: primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development.So treating a patient (a pregnant mother) during these times would mean a reprogrammed DNA methylation pattern and could cause cancer (in her baby).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells the imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele, and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. So CTCF binds on the unmethylated maternal ICR, blocks the enhancers, so Igf2 is not expressed.the paternal allele is methylated, the enhancers can act on IGF2, because CTCF is not binding to inhibit this, so IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele.<br />Hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele lead on  double dose of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell. <br />Igf2 growth promoting, and this is associated with Wilm's tumour.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. In cancer CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than in normal cells, so tumor supressor genes are silenced with CpG promoter methylation.<br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells so they are silenced and not transscripted. In cancer these regions are unmethylated and so transscripted.With these repetitive elements the cancer cell will have multiple dose of RNA-s, proteins, transscripted and active oncogenes.<br /><br /><br /></div>
