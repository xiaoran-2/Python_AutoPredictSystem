    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands in normal cells is usually hypomethylated. CpG islands methylation is linked to silencing of gene expression, which is associated with chromatin packaging.<br /><br />DNA methylation at CpG islands in cancer cells is hypermethylated (high level of methylation) . These CpG islands are located in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, which results in epimutation. This hypermethylation is more frequent than other mutations and progresses with time.<br /><br />DNA hypermethylation at CPG islands in cancer can be one of the hits of Knudson hypothesis (cancer is an event of various hits)  and it is varied by different tumour types. More CGI hypermethylation will take place as tumour progresses. Tumourigenecity can be the consequences from CGI hypermethylation of a single gene (<em>MLH1</em>), sets of genes (CIMP) and panels of genes. Hypermethylation at CpG island shores is also found in cancer.<br /><br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitve elemets in normal cells are highly methylated. This may maintain genomic integrity.<br /><br />In cancer cells, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated hence it brings genomic instability. Transposition and transcriptional interference from strong promoters may no longer be prevented and illegitimate recombination will occur.<br /><br />DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can enhance or suppress tumorigenesis therefore it is context dependent. For example, hypomethylation of Dnmt1 due to its deletion can drive tumour suppressor hypermethylation which suppress cancer, however if in another type of tumour this is driven by chromosomal instability, it seems that the hypomethylation can enhance tumorigenesis. This effect is also stage specific.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs displays loss of imprinting. In H19/Igf2 cluster, ICR in the paternal allele is methylated. DNA methylation spreads to silence H19 promoter, and the enhancers downstream can access Igf2 . The Igf2 expression is then activated.<br /><br />In the maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated. Insulator protein CTCF binds to ICR and insulate Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. Therefore Igf2 will be silent and the expression is not seen.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, due to loss of imprinting, ICR of the maternal allele is also hypermethylated. A double dose of Igf2 expression occurs. <br /><br />Igf2 is associated with growth promoting. Loss of imprinting results in overexpression of the growth promoting gene in this case. This is an early event which is often seen in pre-neoplastic tissues.<br /><br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an FDA approved drug to be against myelodysplastic syndrome that belongs to DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors.<br /><br />Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which inhibits DNA methylation by binding DNMT irreversibly and preventing methylation of DNA daughter strands at DNA replication. <br /><br />Tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated in cancer cells therefore these genes are silenced. Decitabine inhibits this hypermethylation and these genes are re-activated. Decitabine is cell replicating dependent. As cancer cells are dividing rapidly, dosing of Decitabine can severely affect replication of cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation by epigenetic drugs could be mitotically heritable and these alterations could go through transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.<br /><br />Sensitive period is a period when environmental changes have the biggest effect on epigenetic control.<br /><br />There are two sensitive periods of development: germ cell development (primordial germ cells to mature sperms or eggs) and early embryonic development, (pre-implantation to post-implantation) when epigenetic reprogramming takes place.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods are not inadvisable because these periods are most sensitive to epigenetic changes. Since most drugs are epigenetic makeup inhibitors they disrupt epigenetic reprogramming (epigenetic marks erase and reset) during the sensitive periods by such chemical exposure and this could bring dramatic epigenetic abnormalities and even genetic abnormalities because of the genetic-epigenetic interaction. As epigenetic/genetic alteration is highly associated with a number of syndromes and cancers, treating people in sensitive periods is not reasonable.</div>
