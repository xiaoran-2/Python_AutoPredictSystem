    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpG islands
are not methylated in normal cells. It 
appears  that  CpG 
islands  have  been 
evolutionarily conserved  to  promote 
gene  expression  by 
regulating  <span>the chromatin
structure and transcription factor binding(Moore, Thuc Le and Fan). In cancer
cells CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated. In cancer the CpG islands tumor suppressor
genes may be silenced, allowing rapid cell division causing cells to outcompete
neighbors growing into tumors. In normal intergenic regions, introns and
repetitive elements are hypermethylated…in cancer the intergeneic regions are
hypomethylated.</span>  Hypomethylation of
intergeneic regions leads to copying errors incllluding deletions, insetions
and other errors in the chromosomes.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Methylation
occurs near lgf2 locus at the Imprint Control Region (ICR) of the paternal allele,
No methylation for maternal allele in normal cells.  The maternal allele experiences CTCF binding.
CTCF is a protein that has been shown to play multiple roles in the regulation
of gene expression. CTCF is involved in many cellular processes, including
transcriptional regulation, insulator activity, and regulation of chromatin
architecture.[Wikipedia]. CTCF binds to maternal not paternal allele leading to
silencing of H19 gene and drives expression of lgf2. This results in a normal
dose of H19 is expressed from the maternal allele and lgf2 from paternal allele
in normal cell activity.  However, when disrupted,
the ICR becomes hypermethylated and both strands appear paternal and the system
gets excessive growth promoting lgf2 and no H19.  <span>Wilm’s tumor is associated with this phenomena.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine
belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors class which cause DNA Hypomethylation.
Decitabine, sold as Dacogen , is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes(bone
marrow produced deformed blood cells) , the precursors of acute myelogenous
leukaemia.  <span>Dictabine induced DNA Hypomethylation
has effect of reversing epigenetically silenced tumor suppression.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation can be used as a gene
regulatory strategy for cancer treatment because after treatment the effects
can be enduring through mitotically active DNA methyltransferase.   However, these interventions may cause disruption
in normal genomic function particularly during sensitive periods, such as times
during extensive epigenetic reprogramming. Sensitive periods were identified in
the lecture as periods
of pre-implantation development and germ cell development. </span></p>
