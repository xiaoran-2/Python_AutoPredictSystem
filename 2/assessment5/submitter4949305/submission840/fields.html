    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation brings about heterochromatin formation. Genes whose CpG islands are methylated are silenced. In cancer many CpG rich promoters, especially for tumor suppressors, experience hypermethylation and thus silencing. This removes some of the gatekeeping mechanisms for DNA damage repair and cell cycle control allowing the cancer to grow wild and accumulate mutations.<br /><br />DNA methylation also occurs at integenic regions and repetitive elements in normal genome. In cancer these regions are hypomethylated, which most likely results in chromosomal instability (thus translocations - mutations) and activation of transposable elements (also mutagenic).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span> Decitabine is a demethylating agent, more specifically inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase. In cancer which are driven by hypermethylation of tumour suppressors decitabine would help reactivate them, reinstating cell's gatekeeping mechanism, likely leading to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and possibly associated apoptosis.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and thus can act on the "offspring" of the affected cell, stably affecting the cancer as a whole.<br /><br />Sensitive periods of development are periods in which epigenomic marks are being reset - in early primodial cell development and at blastocyst level. Therefore pregnant women, young girls (when their oocytes develop) and men in reproductive age should be avoided.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Paternal allele is methylated, maternal is not. Methylation prevents CTCF binding leading to silencing of Igf2. Hypermethylation of the cluster in Wilm's tumor leads to more Igf2 production (double-paternal phenotype), which promotes growth of the cancer cells.</div>
