    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">Normally CpG islands are less methylated than it is found in tumor tissues while overall methylation of DNA throughout the genome is higher in normal differentiated cells. In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated for many types of tumors. Newly described effect is hypermethylation of CpG island shores flanking (~2 kb) an island itself. This may lead to disruption of promotor activity in that regions and changing expression of oncogenes and tumor supressors. Another effect is hypermethylation of ICRs that leads to changes in imprinting pattern of genes involved in tissue growth, for instance. Methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements silences expression of transposons and related sequences. Disruption of methylation in intergenic regions (hypomethylation of them) leads to increased rate of chromosome abberations. Together with changes in expression level of oncogenes and tumor supressors it creates background for genetic variability and abnormal behavior of malignant cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes in methylation pattern can affect different ICRs that leads to effects that can facilitate uncontrolled cell growth. For instance, in H19/Igf2 cluster in normal cells methylation that occurs on paternal chromosome prevents binding of CTCF protein as well as silences H19 expression. Due to absence of CTCF bound enhancer region can act on Igf2 making it expressed. Maternal pattern consists of expressed H19 and silenced Igf2. After additional methylation occurs on ICR site an individual obtains to paternal-like locuses that causes overexpression of Igf2. This is observed in Wilm's tumor. Igf2 stands for Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 (somatomedin A). Overexpression of this protein may cause autoinduction of cell proliferation and abnormalities of cell differentiation. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a group of DNA-demethylating agents. It can be useful when tumor is associated with hypermethylation marks. Usually it is applied for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. The effect of Decitabine and other representatives of its group is connected with 'cleaning' of hypermethylated marks on genome. If tumor progression was associated with acquisition of such marks (leading to changes in gene expression and other abnormalities) 'cleaning' might change the cell cycle to 'normal' side.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is passed in mitosis via copy mechanism. Newly acquired pattern can be then maintained by cell protein machinery. Sensitive period for human organism is germ-line cell divisions and early gestation. Application of such drugs in this period can lead to severe abnormalities. But serious adverse effects are common to cytostatic drugs so 'safety' reasons do not decrease the value of new epigenetic drugs.<br /></div>
