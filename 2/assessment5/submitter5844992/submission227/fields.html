    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands is usually scarce and generally associated with inactivation of a promoter. One of the hallmarks of cancer is hypermethylation of CpG islands, leading to decreased expression of genes under the influence of the methylated promoters. This disruption of DNA methylation may contribute to cancer as it can be the cause of inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.<br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is generally used to keep these regions in an "inactive" state, and avoid genomic instability. These regions are composed by repetitive sequences which are more prone to non-homologous recombination events, that could generate several chromosomal aberrations such as amplifications, deletions, translocations, activation of transposons,... The methylated state hampers this type of interactions, it helps maintain chromatin in a more dense and condensed state, protecting against those dangerous events. Contrary to happens with CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive sequences are generally hypomethylated in cancer. Hypomethylation of these regions decreases the "protective state" described above and cells become more prone to undergo chromosomal alterations, acquiring the genomic instability that is one of the recognized hallmarks of cancer. Chromosomal aberrations will then cause loss or gain of chromosome segments, and therefore the genes associated which can be essential for cellular homeostasis. With these genes altered, tumor progression is facilitated.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Deregulation of imprinted regions is another type of epigenetic alteration in cancer. One of the best examples is deregulation of H19/Igf2 cluster. In a normal situation, the ICR (imprinting control region) is methylated in the paternal allele, allowing the transcription of the Igf2 gene. On the other hand, the ICR in the maternal allele is normally unmethylated. The unmethylated ICR is bound by an insulator factor that will impede the transcription of the Igf2 gene (enhancers act on H19 and not on Igf2). Therefore, in normal cells Igf2 is transcribed from only one of the alleles (the paternal allele).<br />In Wilm's tumour, the ICR in the maternal allele is hypermethylated and, hence, enhancers act on Igf2 promoting its transcription from that allele. Igf2 acts as a growth promoter, and in Wilm's tumour Igf2 production is double of what should normally be, and so it contributes to tumor progression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">One of the characteristics of epigenetic marks is that they are mitotically inherited. Thus, if, for example, a cell has a gene methylated, all of the cells derived from this one by mitosis will also have the gene methylated. If the methylation state is altered, due to the action of a drug, in that cell, that alteration (in this case demethylation) will also be passed to the other cells generateg by mitosis. Therefore it is enough that the drug has an effective action during the administration period for its effects being endured. A sensitive period is a period of time when the epigenetic landscape is being set up, when the environment is more likely to cause epigenetic alterations. The sensitive periods of development are the period of pre-implantation an and early post-implantation and the period from germ cell formation to production of mature gametes. As epigenetic marks are mitotically inheritable the marks set during these sensitive periods will affect the future individuals permanently. Using drugs that cause epigenetic alterations should therefore be avoided specially during the reproductive age, when individuals are producing gametes, and in women during pre- and early gestation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug that belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents. As the class name indicates Decitabine is a drug that causes DNA demethylation, and more specifically it acts as an inhibitor of DNMT (DNA-methyltranferase). Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue capable of irreversible binding to DNMTs, hindering its action.<br />It is known that cancer cells are characterized by having CpG islands hypermethylated, what can contribute to decreased expression of some genes, for e.g tumor suppressor genes. By decreasing DNA methylation, Decitabine can revert these hypermethylated CpG islands to their normal state and, therefore, also the expression of those genes that have a central role in regulating cell growth and proliferation. </div>
