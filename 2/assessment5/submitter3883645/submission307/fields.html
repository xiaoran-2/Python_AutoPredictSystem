    <div class="field-value">a) In general methylation of CpG islands correlates inversely with gene expression. So in healthy cells methylation decides of CpG islands leads to imprinting, X inactivation and heterochromatin formation. Promotor regions have CpG islands can be demethylated and therefore are active (i.e. gene expression).<br />b) The CpG islands of promoter regions for tumor suppressors are hypermethylated and therefore are inactive or silenced (i.e. no gene expression).<br />c) If tumor supressors are not expressed any tumor can grow without any inhibition.<br />d) In healthy cells intergenic regions and repetetive elements are methylated and as a result silenced.<br />e) The hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements allows these parts of the dna to form more open structures (eu chromatine) and are activated (e.g. expression).<br />f) Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetetive elements leads to genomic instability, an abnormal karyotype. Illegitimate recombination of repeats are possible because the repetitive elements are genetically similar. The repetitive elements can make a copy of themselves and jump around (transpose). This can cause disruption of the coding region of a gene or activate neighbouring genes (cryptic promoter) resulting in transcriptional aberations such as deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations causing cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">a) Decitabine is a dna demethylating agent: DNMTi<br />b) Decitabine is incorporated into the DNA and leads to covalent binding to DNA methyl transferase. Decitabine is replication dependent.<br />c) Cancer cells are replicating very fast and this can be the reason if healthy cells are replicating slower that Decibatine causes cytoxicity preferably in cancer cells. No cancer therapy is without side effects.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">a) If a change to the DNA such as methylation is mytoticaly heritable the change is passed on to cells of the next generations. For example DNMT1 is known to watch over the methylation state of the DNA. So, despite stopping administration of epigenetic drugs cells keep the epigenetic mark and this might have a beneficial impact for standard chemotherapy.<br />b) Any phase in an organism's cell cycle in which epigenetic marks are set, removed and reset. <br />c) Blastocyst formation, primordial germ cell generation. That is babies, young children, adolescents and people who have the potential to become parents (primordial germ cells are developing) as well as pregnant women (the developing human being in the womb goes through stages in which epigenetic marks are set and removed) should not get these drugs.<br />d) The administration of epigenetic drugs would not only target cancer cells but also the healthy cells which could have fatal consequences for the individual. The setting of epigenetic marks of healthy and cancer cells could be impacted and could create havoc.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">a) On the paternal allele the imprint region is methylated. As a results the enhancers express Igf2 on the paternal allele.<br />b) The maternal allele is not methylated and the insulator molecule CTCF can bind which silenses Igf2 but instead H19 is expressed.<br />c) Loss of imprinting happens and hypermethylation on both the maternal and paternal allele occurs which leads to both alleles to express Igf2. No expression of H19 occurs anymore.<br />d) Igf2 is growth promoting and overexpression leads to cancer.</div>
