    <div class="field-value"><p><span>•The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression, such as what is observed in X inactivation or chromatin formation. CpG islands in promotor regions of a gene are generally speaking, unmethylated.<br />• With cancer, CpG promoter regions become hyper-methylated; this has the effect of silencing the underlying gene. Changes that are observed are an overall demethylation  across the genome, but regional gains in methylation, resulting in instability, deregulation  of tissue-specific and imprinted genes, as well as silencing of tumour-suppressor genes (Hassler &amp; Egger,  2012).<br />• The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is that of silencing<br />• In cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypo-methylated leading to expression of these elements, resulting in incorrect transcription,  loss of imprinting, nonsense replication due to active repeat sequences or  other phenomena.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />• The normal imprinting pattern for H19/Igf2 is that the paternal Igf2 allele and maternal H19 genes are expressed. The paternal allele will have H19 slienced, while the maternal allele will have Igf2 silenced. <br />• When Loss of Imprinting occurs, the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted so that the maternal allele has the same methylation pattern as the paternal allele (methylation of the H19 promoter to silence it  and Igf2 turned on). <br />• This will lead to abnormal cell growth patterns, such as what is observed in Wilm’s tumour (Steenman et al, 1994), where H19 is not expressed properly. This abnormal cell growth or proliferation is a hallmark of cancer cells. <br />• Disrupting imprinting at this cluster, therefore, contributes to cancer by allowing the overexpression of Igf2 and no expression of H19, a tumour-suppressing region.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">• Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that may be used to treat cancer.<br />• It is part of a drug class which has the effect of demethylating DNA. <br />• Specifically, the aim of such drugs would be to remove the hyper-methylation that occurs at tumour-suppressor sites, allowing the underlying gene to be expressed and effectively shrink tumour cells. (The Economist, 7 Apr 2012)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />• Altering DNA methylation can  result in lasting changes to the epigeneome because it is a “stable epigenetic mark”  (Hassler &amp; Egger, 2012). <br />• Resetiing of DNA methylation  occurs during gametogenesis and after fertilization, known as sensitive periods -  times when the cells are most susceptible to disruption. <br />• These two sensitive periods are times in which you would not want to be treating someone with DNA demethylation drugs,  as those changes could  potentially be passed along into the gametes  or the blastocyst,  resulting in unintentional effects.</div>
