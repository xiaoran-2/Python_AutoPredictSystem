    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a normal and
necessary part of development.  Methylation usually silences highly
repetitive regions of DNA at CpGs.  However, the majority of CpG
islands in promoters normally appear to be free of methylation.  In
contrast, DNA methylation patterns appears to be significantly
altered in cancer cells.  Under methylation (hypomethylation) of
certain regions, such as repetitive elements and intergenic regions,
and hypermethylation of other regions, such as CpG islands of
promoters and island shores, is a signature of many tumor cells. 
Specific methylation of of CpG islands in promoter regions may result
in the silencing of transcription.  In particular, hypermethylation
of CpG islands in the promoter of tumor suppressor genes has been
observed in many cancers.  In contrast, hypomethylation may be found
in repetitive elements and intergenic regions, which are thought to
lead to the instability of the genome with DNA transpositions and
loss of heterochromatin.  This appears to occur when the repetitive
elements undergo demethylation.  Under normal conditions these
repetitive regions are silenced by methylation and therefore prevents
the transposition of the DNA sequence and heterochromatin.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, the maternal genome is
imprinted at the H19/Igf2 allele.  This imprinting is due to
hypermethylation of the imprint control region and hypermethylation
of H19 on the paternal allele.   Methylation at the imprint control
region of the paternal allele prevents the binding of the CTCF zinc
finger protein and allows for the enhancer-mediated expression of the
paternal insulin-like growth factor (Igf2).   In contrast,
methylation at the H19 loci leads to little or no expression of the
long noncoding RNA.  These regions are not methylated on the maternal
allele, resulting in enhancer-mediated expression of H19 and binding
of CTCZ that blocks Igf2 expression.</p>

<p>There is a loss of imprinting control
in children exhibiting Wilm's Tumor, which results in increased
expression of Igf2.  This occurs when the maternal imprint control
region and the H19 alleles are methylated.  The maternal H19/Ifg2
cluster is then expressed as if it were the paternal allele and leads
to abnormally high levels of Igf2, which in turn is likely
responsible for the cancer observed in the kidneys of young children.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cytidine analog that
inhibits DNA methylation.  In this regard it may be considered as a
epigenetic hypomethylation drug, which is approved for treatment of
myelodysplastic syndromes.  Although it is unclear what the precise
mechanism of action for Decitabine is, it may be targeting the
epigenetic methylation events at CpG islands and the CpG shores that
are signatures of most if not all cancers.  Therefore, Decitabine may
be preventing the silencing of tumor suppressor genes or other
critical genes that are required by the normal cell.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During cancer there may be important
transcription factors and other tumor suppressor gene silenced by
methylation and reversal of methylation may control abnormal tumor
growth and reprogram cells away from their neoplastic expression back
toward normal cell expression.  Since epigenetic methylation is
mitotically heritable, demethylation and normal expression would
likely be passed to daughter cells.  However, during sensitive
periods, like placental and germ cell epigenetic reprogramming, it
would probably be inadvisable to administer drugs that inhibit
methylation as this could lead to faulty imprinting, and faulty
methylation of paternal and maternal genomes.   Thus, epigenetic
marks may be aberrant if methylation is inhibited during primordial
germ cell development and in the early stages of embryo development.
