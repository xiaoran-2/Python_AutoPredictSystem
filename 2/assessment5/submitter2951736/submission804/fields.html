    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, the disruption of DNA methylation is mainly detected as
genome-wide hypomethylation or tumor suppressor hypermethylation.</p><p> In normal, non-malignant cell, CpG islands represent clusters of
unmethylated CpG dinucleotides that are usually found from the 5’ regulatory regions of the
genes. <br /></p><p>In cancer, the CpG islands locating at gene promoter or control regions
are often hypermethylated which leads to transcriptional silencing.</p>



<p>The hypermethylation of transcriptional control regions leading
to the silencing of tumorsuppressor genes can thus act as an alternative to
a silencing mutation. The gene silencing again can lead to uncontrolled and
increased rate of cell divisions or decreased rate of apoptosis. </p>



<p>The CpG dinucleotides in intragenic regions and repetitive elements are in
normal situation methylated. It has been speculated to reflect for example the removal of
transcriptional noise from alternative start sites of a gene.</p>



<p>In cancer, the normally methylated intragenic regions and repetitive
elements are, however, non-methylated or in other words hypomethylated.</p>



<p>One of the main functions of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic
stability. The hypomethylation of intragenic regions and repeats reduce the
genomic stability by opening up the DNA and enabling recombination between
chromosomes and thus increasing the risk of karyotypic abnormalities to emerge.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;" lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">The paternal allele of H19/Igf2 is normally methylated at H19 leading to
the silencing of the H19 gene. Futrthermore, the insulator protein CTCF cannot
bind and the enhancers from distant promoter region of the Igf12 gene can act
and activate Igf2 gene.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;" lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">The maternal allele is hypomethylated at the imprinting control region
(ICR) of the H19/Igf2 allowing the expression of H19 gene and the binding of
CTCF insulator protein upstream of H19. This inhibits the distant enhancers to
act on Igf2 promoter and thus blocks the activity of Igf2 gene.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;" lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">  </span>

</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;" lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In Wilms tumor, both maternal and paternal alleles are hypermethylated at
the imprinting control region of the H19/Igf2. This leads to paternal
expression pattern from both alleles and overexpression of Igf2 gene.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;" lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Igf2 gene encodes insulin-like growth factor II which normally supports
normal cell growth. The loss of imprinting leading to double dose of Igf2 leads to increase of proliferative
signals and thus promotes cancer progression.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a group of DNA-demethylating agents (DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors). It inhibits DNA methyltransferase and that way hypomethylates DNA. It is a nucleoside analog that gets incorporated into DNA during replication. Anti-tumor effect of Decitabine is based on the fact that DNA-methyltransferase binds irreversibly to the inhibitor especially on hypermethylated tumorsuppressor genes that are thus inactive. Hypomethylation restores the normal function of tumorsuppressor gene and normal growth control. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
