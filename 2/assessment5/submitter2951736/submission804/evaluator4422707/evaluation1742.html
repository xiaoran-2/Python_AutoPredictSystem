    <div class="field-value">Hi! I just need to clarify for your responses to question 1:
CpG dinucleotides I thought were present in CpG islands. But then you indicate (and I want to make sure that I am not confused here) that they are present within the intergenic regons and repetitive elements. Those regions in the genome contain much more bases than cytosines and guanines. A CpG island is a region in the genome that is rich in CpG dinucleotides, which as you correctly state, is found near the promoter of genes.

 It also seems that you repeat most of your statements, and so this made your responses very complicated to read. I had to reread what you'd written several times, and after having placed everything into context, I was able to then grade you. I awarded you points however for correctly identifying key terms and themes in cancer.

Okay, now for question 2. You're making it seem like it is the methylation of the H19 lncRNA promoter (which is silenced on the paternal allele) that prevents the CTCF insulator protein from binding. I guess why I point this out is because you did not directly state that the ICR for the paternal allele at the H19/IGf2 locus is methylated ---- this is actually what prevents the CTCF insulator protein from binding, resulting in H19 being effectively silenced on the paternal allele, and allowing IGf2 instead to be expressed (downstream enhancers are free to turn on the IGf2 promoter). This is why I awarded you only 1 point for that question. Also, the reason why the H19 promoter on the paternal allele is methylated is actually because heterochromatin from the DNA methylation  of the paternal ICR spreads to that H19 promoter effectively silencing it.

What is repressed on the maternal allele (IGf2) is only expressed on the paternal allele (the imprinted IGf2 gene --- I was also specifically looking for you to state this) because of that methylated  ICR on the paternal allele which prevents CTCF from binding. This explains why there is a loss of imprinting in Wilm's tumor (or disrupted imprinting) ---- because the maternal allele expresses what looks like the paternal allele (which you correctly identify). Very well organized responses for question 2. Good job!

Just 1 more thing. Furthermore, on the maternal allele, the CTCF insulator binding site is simply unmethylated, not hypomethylated, as you indicated. 

For question 3, Decitabine's anti-tumor effect is that since it inhibits DNA methyltransferase during cell division by binding to it, making it irreversible, by doing so, it also adversely affects the way that the tumor suppressor genes bind to DNA methyltransferase. When it becomes irreversible, tumor suppressor genes which were silenced due to DNA hypermethylation, are now expressed, and normal cell growth is restored (as you correctly mention).

Why didn't you answer question 4 if you don't mind me asking?

Okay, well you tried real good. Very good job!</div>
