    <div class="field-value">DNA Methylation at CPG island (and elsewhere at some extent) is the "Flagship" of processes in the epigenetic machinery, it is involved in numerous processes like X inactivation, gene imprinting and tissue specific gene silencing through the compaction of the genome (heterochromatin configuration). CPG Islands at promoter sites though are normally mostly kept free of methylation BUT in cancer cells where they tend to be hypermethylated causing the silencing of the related gene which may prevent cancer though genomic stability or by expression of a repair machinery (tumor supressor gene). In normal cells Intergenic regions hypermethylation (often at repetitive elements) play also a role by inhibiting noise transcription by of alternative transcription binding (cryptic promoters)  sites and/or keeping a good gene expression time machinery by managing MicRNA/noncodingRNA. In Cancer cells these regions become hypomethylated leading of a disruption of the above mentioned machinery through genomic instabilities leading to translocation (recombinations between repeats), deletion or insertion in the genome. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer parental specific imprinting is often impaired leading to overexpresion or underexpression (respectively both parental alleles are expressed or silenced). The silencing/expression dynamic is determined by the methylation at Imprint Controled Regions (ICR).<br /><br />For the specific case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the maternal ICR is NORMALLY unmethylated and the father's one is  methylated. The maternal allele ICR region can then bond an insulator protein (CTCF) that prevent "enhancer" proteins binding to Igf2; these protein will then bind to H19 region leading the expression of H19 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) <strong>but not Igf2</strong>. On the paternal side of NORMAL cells, the ICR is methylated, the CTCF insulating protein cannot bond to the ICR region and the "enhancer" protein can then bind to the Igf2 coding region (preferred loop due to chromatin structure) leading to the expression of Igf2 proteins but not the H19 lncRNA (spreading of methylation from ICR -Silence Spreading). <strong>Igf2 is solely expressed from the paternal allele (father imprinted).</strong><br />In Wilm's Tumor, there is an hypermethylation of that region leading to the loss of imprinting. There is a double dose of Igf2 protein in these cells and since this protein is growth-related it creates abnormal mitosis behavior.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating inhibitor drug primarily for myelodysplastic syndrome. The goal of this drug is to reduced the level of methylation in cancer cells (in the case of presence of hypermethylation).<br />Decitabine is a nucleotide analog that is incorporated into the nucleus of cells. Upon replication, they are introduced into the genome of the cells and when Methyl transferase enzyme acts on the copied cells to copy the methylation state of the parent cell, it binds to this nucleotide analog irreversibly. This leads to a diminution of available methyl transferase in the daughter cell and thus reduced the state of overall methylation of the cells. Since cancer cells copy rapidly, they are the most affected by the drug and since their problem resulting in cancer cells is primarily hypermethylation, the drug has a potent anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since epigenome is mitoticaly heritable, once changes have been done on cells, they will stay and be copied to their daughter/granddaughter etc. cells (unless spontaneous mutation/disruption arises). There is some special period in development where this rule is not kept and where the epigenome undergoes disruption/reprogramming. There is one preriod in-utero at the blastocyst stage and and another at the early germ cells development.These period would be considered sensitive since anti-cancer epigenomic disruptive drugs may have extreme effect if taken at these development stage. Treating patient at these stage would be very problematic since it would almost certainly lead to fetal death (for pregnant women) and or infertility (for girl fetus undergoing oogenesis in their mother's womb for example or for infant or pre-teen still having germ cells maturation).There is also the period of childhood and pre-teen where the body is in constant gowth and thus these kind of drugs may have a lot more side effect since these drugs are "attacking" every cells that duplicate (cancer cells and healthy cells).<br /></div>
