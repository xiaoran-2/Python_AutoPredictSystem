    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is when a gene has to be heterechromatinised or silenced.<br />methylation disrupted in cancer cells as it can be hypermethylated or hypomethylated for example it may be hypomethylated at repeats causing aberrant expression or hypermethylated at tumor supressor gene promotors.<br />DNA methylation is present at intergenic regions as they are non coding regions,DNA is methylated at repetitive elements so they donot transpose.<br />DNA hypomethylated at intergenic and repetitive elements in cancer.<br />repetitive elements if hypomethylated can transpose causing aberrant gene expression, at intergenic regions the DNA will become euchromatin and expressed.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">paternal allele methylated H19 region and ICR and enhancers access Igf2 and it is expressed.<br />ICR and H19 unmethylated in maternal allele and enhancers donot access Igf2 is not expressed.<br />In Wilm's tumor hypermethylation of ICR in maternal allele as well as paternal allele hene maternal allele expresses Igf2 as well.<br />double dose of Igf2 and it is growth promoting and this is related to Wilm's tumor.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNMT1.<br />used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia, at the gene which when methylated causes myelodysplastic syndromes, decitabine causes hypomethylation in those regions on the gene by preventing DNMT1 binding and methylation hence having an anti-tumor effect.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can hav enduring effect on the epigenome by making the DNA more or less susceptible to methylation then the tissue that is damaged may more readily take up the chemotherapy.<br />sensitive periods are when the DNA is still taking up the epigenetic marks and these marks have not been established on the DNA yet, and the DNA is still susceptible to epigenetic changes<br />sensitive periods of development are the Primordial Germ Cell development and at the blastocyst stage.<br />treating patients during the sensitive periods is unadvisable as the natural epigenetic marks are yet to be established also treating patiets at this time would reverse or cause aberrant gene expression by improperly placed epigenetic marks.<br /></div>
