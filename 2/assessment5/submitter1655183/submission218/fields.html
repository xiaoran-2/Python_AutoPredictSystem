    <div class="field-value">The epigenetic patterns of DNA methylation are disrupted in cancer cells.<br />DNA methylation at CpG islands is normally present at a low level and associated with potential access to associated promoters and therefore potential transcription of genes.  Those islands which are methylated are fewer in number and associated with inaccessible promoters and genes, often in heterochromatin.<br />In most cancer cells there is a generalized increase in methylation at CpG islands rendering genes silent.  Among the silenced genes are those which code for tumor suppressor proteins, resulting in the lack of normal control over cell growth, division and death. The result is a clone of rapidly dividing cancerous cells at the expense of the surrounding normal cells.<br /><br />In most normal cells there is abundant methylation at repetitive elements and in intergenic DNA.  This is reversed in cancer cells.  As a result transcription machinery can access these areas and the areas are more often found in a euchromatic state.  Cryptic promoters can be activated leading to aberrant transcription of genes, a potentially oncogenic event.  Tranposons can be active and multiply and jump to other portions of the genome, occasionally disrupting genes.  Additionally the repetitive elements which are now accessible can pair with like sequences  or induce replicative slippage and induce gene duplication or deletion.  The net result is genomic instability in which the cells which proliferate are more likely to be those with genomes with duplicated growth factor receptor genes, growth factor genes or absent tumor suppressor genes.  Unstable genomes are more likely to produce further selectable mutagenic events and thus progeny prone to immortality, rapid growth and invasion, i. e. cancer cells.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of imprinting is a common early abnormality in the genome of pre neoplastic cells.<br /><br />For example in Wilms tumor the methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted resulting in overproduction of Igf2 a growth promoter.  <br />Normally there is an unmethylated  ICR (and also the H19 promoter) on the maternal allelle which then is free to bind a protein, CTCF, which prevents the downstream enhancers from interacting with the IgF2 promoter. Instead the enhancer activates the H19 promoter.  In contrast the paternal ICR is methylated and does not bind CTCF.  The H19 promoter is also methylated and thus silenced.  The enhancers on the paternal chromosome are free to interact with the Igf2 promoter, resulting in Igf2 production.  <br /><br />In Wilms tumor the ICR on the maternal allele has become methylated so Wilms tumor cells now have two paternal like alleles, resulting in enhancers on both chromosomes activating the transcription and thus over production of the Igf2 protein which contributes to one of the hallmarks of caner, sustained proliferative signaling.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNMT inhibitors or DNMTis.  <br />The drug has been shown to reduce DNA methylation in cells, by reducing the passive methylation which occurs with DNA replication and cell division.<br />In myelodysplastic cells this loss of methylation at CpG promoters has resulted in a favorable response, presumably because one of the major abnormalities in this syndrome is abnormal methylation/silencing at CpG islands of the promoters of tumor suppressor genes.  This demethylation in progeny cells results in the production of  the tumor suppressor proteins, an anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The DNA methylation patterns of the genome are mitotically heritable and are thus passed on to progeny cells, thus methylation patterns can be enduring.<br />Sensitive periods of development are those periods in which there is a great deal of epigenetic programming and reprogramming are occurring.<br />In mammals these occur in the early embryo , shortly after fertilization, when the genomes of the sperm and egg are reset to become pluripotential and then begin to differentiate and also during the formation of the primordial germ cells which occurs later in embryogenesis and in females is not completed until shortly before ovulation and affects the next generation.  Large portions of the genome undergo demethylation and remethylation during these times.<br />Drugs which interfere with epigenetic control could have widespread, permanent, unpredictable  affect on gene expressions during development if administered during these sensitive periods, and thus would be risky and inadvisable.<br /><br /></div>
