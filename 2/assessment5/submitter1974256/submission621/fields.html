    <div class="field-value">CpG are the Cytosine followed by Guanine as DNA sequence (CG) with a phosphate bond between them. CpG tends to occur in clusters and hence called CpG islands, they occur most frequently in the promoter regions of a gene. Cytosine is methylated at the 5th carbon position with the addition of methyl group. CpGs are symmetric and are faithfully replicated mitotically, methylated CpGs are also mitotically replicated through DNMT1 enzyme. Normal function of the methylated CpG islands is to <b>SILENCE</b> the gene. As CpG islands tend to occur in promoters, they are <b>protected</b> from methylation by natural selection with <b>few exceptions</b>, notable one is in X inactivation, where CpG islands are methylated to silence the genes in X chromosome. <br />In cancer cells, the normal CpG islands which are protected from methylation, gets methylated, known as hypermethylation of CpG islands. They typically happen in the CpG islands of tumor suppression genes.  This disruption allows silencing of tumor suppression. As this epigenetic change is stable and mitotically inheritable,  as oncogenes divide the cell and spread the cancer, tumor suppression genes are effectively  silenced through this epigenetic mechanism which are rapidly selected, causing cancer to spread.<br /><br />Intergenic regions, repetitive elements and introns within DNA generally tend to be methylated. Intergenic regions may contain promoters that interacts with DNA polymerases in such a way as to cause insertions, translocations and deletions in the adjacent genes. Hence methylation of these regions promote genomic stability. The repeat elements replicate themselves with copy-and-paste or cut-and-paste operations and silencing of these elements through methylation ensures transposition risks, illegitimate recombination  and transcriptional interferences  are minimized. <br /><br />In Cancer genes  intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated causing genomic instability resulting in cancer.<br />This epigenetic disruption is present genome wide in every cancer studied.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">lgf2 is a growth promoting expression, it is methylated in patternal allele (in imprint control region)  and is not methylated in maternal allele. On the maternal allele, H19 will be expressed through the enhancers but igf2 will be silenced. On the patternal allele, the CTCF is not binding to insulate the igf2 and hence ifg2 will be expressed under normal circumstances.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, there is loss of imprint control and there is methylation (hypermethylation) of imprint control region in maternal allele as well. This results in maternal allele expressing ifg2 as well. This double dose of growth factor in both maternal and paternal allele results in over expression of ifg2. The net result is  childhood kidney tumor called Wilm's tumor. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a class of hypomethylating agents that inhibit DNA methyltransferase to hypomethylate DNA. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) where there are abnormal blast blood cells produced by damaged blood cells in bone marrow and these die fast, leaving fewer healthy blood cells. MDS can develope into  Acute Myelogenous leukemia (AML), a rare blood cancer resulting in  1.2 percent of cancer deaths in U.S. <br />Through inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, Decitabine targets the damged blood cells of bone marrow causing hypomethylation and direct  cytotoxicity that results in cell death (of these damaged abnormal cells). The production of healthy blood cells increases as a result.<br /><br />The effectiveness  has been clinically proven in phase 3 clinical trials <br />example,  <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.11543/abstract;jsessionid=B1FD50EA77A4265F981E9754CDF6024A.f02t01">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.11543/abstract;jsessionid=B1FD50EA77A4265F981E9754CD...</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic alterations are reversible and can be mitotically inheritable. This gives an excellent theruaptic benefit, for example,by altering DNA methylation with drugs. Thus even in cases where altering DNA methylation had not directly reduces the tumor growth, it makes the cell respond to chemo better through the permanent change of epigenetic state of tumor cells.<br /><br />Sensitive periods are the (a) Early embryonic developement and (b) Germ cell development. During this period epigenetic reprogramming is done , paternal and maternal genomes are cleared and reset.<br /><br />Since the tumor growth control is related to somatic maintenance, it makes sense not to treat patients during sensitive periods due to clearing and resetting of geneomes in that period.<br /><br /><br /></div>
