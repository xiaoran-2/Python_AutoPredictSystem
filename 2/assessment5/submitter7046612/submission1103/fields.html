    <div class="field-value">In mammals, DNA methylation at CpG islands within <span> the promoters of </span>a gene can turn the gene off. Methylation of CpG sites within the promoters of tumor suppressor genes lead to their silencing  and promote number of human cancers .Also, the hypomethylation of CpG sites has been associated with the over-expression of oncogenes within cancer cells. The purpose of DNA methylation in intergenic (within gene body) may be in regulating cell context-specific alternative promoters in gene bodies and perhaps also prevent aberrant expression from intragenic promoters. In contrast to the silencing role of methylation in promoter regions, methylation of gene bodies may promote expression potential.  DNA hypomethylation  or hypermethylation of intergenic and the repetitive elements is associated with cancer.  the is methylation status will enhance or silence a range of gene expresssion associated to cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">  <span>The </span>IGF2<span> gene provides instructions for making a protein called insulin-like growth factor 2.  IGF-2 promotes the growth and division (proliferation) of cells in many different tissues. Although the </span>IGF2 gene is highly active during fetal development, it is much less active in the adult body. <span>For the </span>IGF2 gene, however, the copy that is inherited from a person's father is the only active copy in most parts of the body.  IGF2<span> is part of a cluster of genes on the short (p) arm of chromosome 11 that undergo genomic imprinting. Another gene in this cluster is </span>H19.<span> A nearby region of DNA known as imprinting center 1 (ICR1) or the H19 differentially methylated region (H19 DMR) controls the parent-specific genomic imprinting of both the </span>H19<span> and </span>IGF2 genes.  Wilms tumours is associated with loss of maternal allele-specific methylation from a region<br />located upstream of the imprinted IGF2 promoters. <span>Increased activity of the </span>IGF2 gene has been associated with many types of cancer  with both the paternal and the maternal copies of the gene active. An increased amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 may stimulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells from being destroyed. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine  belong to the DNA-demethylating agents class and triggers as hypomethylation.  D<span>ecitabine only  incorporate into DNA strands and induces </span><span> hypomethylation of DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase</span>.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">  Alterations in the cancer epigenome might result from mistargeting or altered composition of epigenetic complexes. un cellular oxidative stress  a complex consisting of DNMTs and HDACs is formed and recruited to the sites of damaged DNA. Components of the complex are recruited from non-GC-rich to GC-rich areas. It is generally believed that early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. any treatment at this period my interfere <span>with DNA methylation, chromatin conformational changes through histone modifications, ncRNAs and, most recently, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and alteration in methylation patterns will associated with disease. </span></div>
