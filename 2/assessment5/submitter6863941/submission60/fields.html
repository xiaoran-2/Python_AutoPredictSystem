    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation of DNA is an epigenetic modiﬁcation that can
play an important role in the control of gene expression in mammalian cells.
The enzyme involved in this process is DNA methyltransferase, which catalyzes
the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-methionine to cytosine residues
to form 5-methylcytosine, a modiﬁed base that is found mostly at CpG sites in
the genome. The presence of methylated CpG islands in the promoter region of
genes can suppress their expression. This process may be due to the presence of
5-methylcytosine that apparently interferes with the binding of transcription
factors or other DNAbinding proteins to block transcription. In different types
of tumors, aberrant or accidental methylation of CpG islands in the promoter
region has been observed for many cancer-related genes resulting in the silencing
of their expression. How this aberrant hypermethylation takes place is not
known. The genes involved include tumor suppressor genes, genes that suppress
metastasis and angiogenesis, and genes that repair DNA suggesting that epigenetics
plays an important role in tumorigenesis. The potent and speciﬁc inhibitor of
DNA methylation, 5-aza-29deoxycytidine (5-AZA-CdR) has been demonstrated to
reactivate the expression most of these “malignancy” suppressor genes in human
tumor cell lines. Thesegenes may be interesting targets for chemotherapy with
inhibitors of DNA methylation in patients with cancer and this may help clarify
the importance of this epigenetic mechanism in tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Aberrant imprinting of the Insulin-like growth factor 2 (<i>IGF2</i>) gene
plays a role in the pathogenesis of the various human cancers.</p>

<a></a><span>Mouse models have been used to demonstrate that
the imprinted expression of the closely linked <i>Igf2</i>
and <i>H19</i> genes is controlled by specific
differentially methylated regions (DMRs). One of these DMRs (the <i>H19</i> DMR) is located 5′ of the <i>H19</i> promoter is methylated on the
paternal chromosome and is known as the imprinting control region IC1 because
it functions as an insulator mediated by the CCCTC binding factor (CTCF).
Deletion of the maternal IC1 results in activation of the normally silent
maternal <i>Igf2</i> allele and in down-regulation
of <i>H19</i>. In addition, a hierarchical
relationship between methylation at IC1 and <i>Igf2</i> exists such
that deletion or mutation within the IC1 also results in methylation changes in
DMRs within the <i>Igf2</i> gene. The application of this
model to the human has been hampered by differences in the genomic organisation
of <i>IGF2</i> DMRs in mouse and human.
Specifically, <i>IGF2</i> DMR0, located 5′ to the main <i>IGF2</i> promoters is methylated on the
maternal allele only in placentas in the mouse, but has differential
methylation in all tissues in humans. </span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><a></a>Decitabine is a
hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA
methyltransferase.</p>

<p>Using restriction enzymes that distinguished between
methylated and unmethylated DNA, the duo showed that the beta-globin locus was
essentially unmethylated in cells that expressed beta-globin but methylated in
other cell types. Direct experiment showed that examined the effects of
inhibiting methylation on gene expression was performed using 5-azacytidine in
mouse cells. 5-azacytidine is one of many chemical analogs for the nucleoside
cytidine. When these analogs are integrated into growing DNA strands, some,
including 5-azacytidine, severely inhibit the action of the DNA
methyltransferase enzymes that normally methylate DNA. Because most DNA
methylation was known to occur on cytosine residues, scientists hypothesized
that if they inhibited methylation by flooding cellular DNA with 5-azacytidine,
then they could compare cells before and after treatment to see what impact the
loss of methylation had on gene expression. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a particularly attractive form of regulation to target in treatments because it can be manipulated once, and enduring effects are ensured as the DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis. However, these global interventions may
interfere with ordinary functioning of the system, especially during critical periods ­­ periods of
time where extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs. In particular, it would be inadvisable to
prescribe these treatments to pregnant mothers (including a few months before conception) as
a lot of reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the formation of
gametes (both male and female) </p>
