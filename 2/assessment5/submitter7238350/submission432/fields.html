    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>In the case of
normal cells, CpG islands are commonly hypomethylated allowing the structure of
euchromatin, and promoting the gene expression. But in the case of cancer cells
CpG islands are normally methylated, and depending on the stage the cancer is
found as hyperplasia, neoplasia or metastasis is less or more methylated
respectively. The heterochromatin derived from these methylations prevents the
expression of the tumour suppressor genes, allowing a faster proliferation of
cancer. As methylations are mitotically heritable this is a good way to maintain
the oncogenic process after the cell division. So, by methylating CpG islands
of cancer cells what we observe is a packaging of DNA that contains anti-tumour
genes, in other words cancer proliferation. </p><p>

</p><p><span>In contrast, in
normal cells the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements (as CpG island
shores) are commonly found methylated and unmethylated in cancer cells (because
of the ageing or because of the recruitment of a DNA methyltransferase). These
methylations help to maintain genomic stability and a normal development of the
organism. But in cancer cells those hypomethylations perform an important paper
in illegitimate recombination, deletions or insertions of chromosomes because
the euchromatin structure derived from them. Those changes produce genomic instability,
or in other words cancer. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The expression
of the H19 and Igf2 genes is regulated by the H19/Igf2 cluster. It is an example
of the imprinting regulation of gene expression in which maternal allele is
unmethylated whereas the paternal one is not. That provides the cell with a
normal expression of both genes. The methylation of the H19 inhibits the union
of CTCF to a specific region of DNA causing only the expression of Igf2 gene
(enhancers are unable to promote the expression of H19 because its promoter is
found on a heterochromatin domain).</p>

<p><span>But if there is
not a methylation on H19, the enhancers will only promote the expression of H19.
A methylation in both alleles is associated with the Wilm’s tumour. As CTCF is
unable to bind DNA in any of both alleles, the cell experiences an overdose of
the growth factor (Igf1). This overdose of the growth factor is the responsible
of the tumorigenesis. In this case, the methylations of both alleles are found
in a very early stage of the tumour development. This fact allows doctors to be
able to prevent the metastasis of the tumour with different therapies. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a
nucleoside analogue incorporated in DNA during the process of replication. This
drug is approved by the Food and Drugs Administration for the treatment of the
myelodyplastic syndrome that derives in AML (acute myeloid leukaemia). After
division DNMT1 recognizes hemimethylated DNA and adds methyl groups to the new
strand. But when it finds the drug the enzyme stacks irreversibly. </p>

<p><span>There is a very poor
prognostic outcome for hypermethylated CpG islands is the myelodysplastic
syndrome. Avoiding the undesirable methylation with decitabine can help on
killing the tumorigenic cells because of the stop of their cell cycle. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylations of the DNA (as is explained in
question 1) are mitotically heritable. That means that after cell division,
both daughter cells will maintain the primordial cell’s epigenetic marks. This
can be seen in the study of the effects of the combination of HDACi and DNMTi. Those
marks will be maintained until they are erased.</p>

<p>There are two sensitive periods during development;
the first one is given during the blastocyst formation, and the second one
during the development of the primordial germ cells. In those sensitive periods
there is a epigenetic reprogramming. An intense removal and a lay down of the
epigenetic marks makes this reprogramming possible. That is the reason why
cells are more sensitive to changes in the environment.</p>

<p><span>Finally, this last reason is the one that explains
why is not advisable to use epigenetic remodelling treatments during sensitive
periods. Any of the changes made on epigenome, would be maintained during the
life of the individual unless the effect of the treatment produces an
aberration or the unavailability of the embryo. </span></p></div>
