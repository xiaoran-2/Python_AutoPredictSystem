    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">DNA present in CpG islands in the promoter region of genes is unmethylated in normal cells both in active form as well as in silent form. But in cancer cells DNA present in CpG islands is usually found to be hypermethylated. This hypermethylation of CpG islands results in silencing the related genes especially in case of tumour suppressor genes it is true. On the other hand,  DNA present in the intergenic region and repetitive elements is usually methylated in normal cell types but in case of cancer cells DNA present in the intergeneic region and repetitive elements is hypomethylated. This hypomethylation of of intergenic region and specially repetitive elements results in genomic instability that cause cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/lgf2 cluster is an example genome imprinting. Igf2 is growth promoter gene. In normal cell types it is only expressed from paternal chromosome while maternal allele is silent. In the paternal allele Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated and Igf2 allele is active. While in maternal allele ICR is unmethylated and Igf2 allele is inactive. So in normal cell type only paternal allele of Igf2 is active. But in case of Wilm's tumour, maternal allele of Igf2 is also expressed due to hypermethylation of ICR. Hence both alleles of Igf2, paternal as well as maternal, due to abnormal hypermethylation of maternal ICT, are expressed, consequently double dose of expressed Igf2 allele promote growth of cell that cause cancer.<br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is FDA approved drug that belongs to the DNMT (DNA methyl transferases) inhibitors class. Decitabine prevents or reduces DNA methylation. Deciabine are nucleoside analogue. So when DNA is replicating in dividing cells and DNMT enzymes are present in cell to add methyl group to daughter DNA these inhibitors bind to the DNMT enzyme that are no more available for methylation of new DNA. Hence in tumours which are mainly caused by hypermethylation of DNA can be managed very by using Decitabine.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation plays important role to maintain vital mechanisms of epigenetic that are important for normal functioning of life, such as gene regulation, X Inactivation and genome imprinting. The periods in which all the mechanisms are occurring are referred to as sensitive periods because ant disruption  at this period will be life threatening. During the development early embryonic development stage and primordial germ cell producing stages are considered to be sensitive. So patients especially pregnant females should not be treated with any drugs that alter DNA methylation, because that can cause abnormalities in their future generations.    </div>
