</span><span>DNA methylation consist of
the addition of a methyl group at the position 5 of a Cytosine base
(5mC) and they are transmitted by methyltransferases. The aberrations
of DNA methylation can occur as hypermethylation in locus specific DNA and/or hypomethylation
genome wide.  The first one is found in CpG islands (CGI's) and CGI's
shores of tumor suppressor genes. Initially DNA methylation at CGI's help to
silence tumor suppressor genes, in an epigenetic way, when they became
hypermethylated. Hypermethylation of CGI's of tumor suppressors have been
practically in all types of tumors. However, this epimutation would be only one
hit, as in Knutson hypothesis, of the number of hits needed to produce a
tumor. The specific CGI's are different on each type of tumor, such as RB in
retinoblastoma, BRCA1 in breast cancer, MLHA1, etc.
Nevertheless, initially the hypermethylation of this CGI's or in their
shores could offer an advantage to cell such as faster speed of
division. <br /><br />
Aberrations presented as genome wide hypomethylation occur in repetitive
elements, on intergenic regions and in the introns of genes. This
aberration also happens in every tumor. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions
causes genomic instability producing in turn, illegitimate recombination
between repeats. In the normal cells this would not happen because they would
be heavily hypermethylated conferring stability to the genome. The
instability would allow deletions, insertions, and reciprocal
translocations in the genome. Furthermore, the repeats in normal cells are
heavily methylated and heterochromatinazed which makes more difficult the
recombination. The hypomethylation occurs in CpG poor promoters too with
oncogene activation, although it is less common than repeats hypomethylation.
Also DNA methylation aberration as genome wide can occur as
 hypomethylation of imprinting control regions (ICR's) and they are
normally related with genes controlling the growth and therefore its alteration
would be related with cancer.</span></p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted
genes, normally are unmethylated on the maternal allele, and
unmethylated or methylated on the paternal allele, which means it is
paternally imprinted. In the case of the maternal allele the CTCF protein binds
to the imprinting control region (ICR) insulating Igf2, but enhancing
H19. On the paternal allele when the ICR is methylated, the methylation is
extended to H19 promoter, and the enhancers can not enhance the H19
expression, allowing Igf2 being expressed and H19 silenced. The disruption of
the imprinting here can cause the Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome and a number of
abnormalities related with the chromosome 11. In some occasion the imprinting
of the H19/Igh2 is disrupted and the maternal allele acts like paternal
allele, which bring no H19 expression and double Igf2 expression, Igf2 is an
oncogene, thus it is related with growth. On Wilm's tumor the maternal allele
is found acting like the paternal allele and therefore there is like having two
paternal alleles which creates an overexpression of Igf2 which ultimately is an
oncogene related with the cell growth.</p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase
inhibitor (DNMTi) type and uses epigenetic approach to
treat myelodysplastic syndromes. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue
and it is incorporated into the DNA, thus it is replication
dependent. When the DNMT appears to copy the methylation, it irreversibly
binds to Decitabine stopping the process. Also as it is replication
dependent it is going to be more effective on those cells that replicate more
frequently, which usually re neoplastic or tumor cells. This treatment works
because the epigenetic mechanism is reversible as a difference with other
mechanisms such as genetic mutations that are not.  </p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation happens as the addition of a methyl group at the position 5 of Cytosine and its transmitted mitotically by methyltransferases DNMT1. DNMT1 recognizes hemi-methylated DNA during the mitosis, an restores methylation on both new strands of daughters cells. Also TET proteins involved in active demethylation are expressed during specific periods. Therefore an alteration of DNA methylation can be transmitted to descendants.<br />Sensitive periods are those when there is epigenetic reprogramming and those periods are during the primordial germ cell development and  pre-implantation period, early development.  <br />During those sensitive periods an environmental insult can affect the epigenetic machinery creating long lasting alterations and diseases, and ultimately, those drugs can be consider as environmental insult affecting the epigenetic imprinting.</div>
