    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are regions of high density of Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine dinucleotides.  They generally occur at the promoter region of genes and are therefore important in the expression of genes.<br /><br />DNA methylation generally silences the expression of genes. <br /><br />In healthy, normal cells there is generally little or no methylation at CpG islands,  thus allowing for the normal transcription of genes. <br /><br />Due to genetic and other cellular mistakes resulting in epigenetic abnormalities, DNA hypo-methylation at CpG islands can be disrupted. CpG islands become hyper-methylated, effectively silencing expression of genes by locking them into an inactive state. When hyper-methylation occurs at the site of tumour-suppressor genes, control of cell growth is disrupted; cells begin to abnormally proliferate and resist death. Methylation is mitotically heritable, becomes more dense, and leads to cancer.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally hyper-methylated. This maintains genome stability. <br /><br />When due to mistakes, intergenic regions of repetitive elements become hypo-methylated,  these areas are no longer silenced. Hypo-methylation of intergenic regions results in chromosome loss/gain and incorrect recombinations between chromosomes.<br /><br />Repeats that are hypo-methylated can make copies of themselves, jump around the genome, transpose, disrupt coding regions;  activate other genes such as tumour-growth genes (oncogenes) , and cause transcriptional mistakes. This incorrect expression of genes leads to genomic instability and can result in cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells display a loss of imprinting. Instead of displaying mono-allelic parent-of-origin specific expression, cancer cells that are no longer imprinted either express from both parental alleles or a silent from both parental alleles.</p><p>Many imprinted genes are growth promoting or growth suppressing genes. Normally, imprint control regions (ICR) are either hyper-methylated or hypo-methylated. Changes in DNA methylation at ICRs result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, or over-expression of growth promoting genes.</p><p>In Wilm's tumour there is and over-expression of Igf2 (hyper-methylation of the ICR). </p><p>Normally the maternal chromosome inhibits Igf2 by having CTRF bind an insulator element at the ICR, resulting in the enhancers acting upon H19. As a result, Igf2 will be silent. In the imprinted paternal gene the ICR is methylated and the enhancers act to express Igf2 (because H19 is highly methylated).</p><p>In cancer, the maternal gene is also methylated at the ICR, the enhancers, like in the paternal chromosome, also act to express Igf2 resulting in a double dose of the growth-promoting Igf2 gene causing the Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent in the form of Azacitidine. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome.<br /><br />Decitabine in combination with a histone-deacetylase inhibitor slows tumour growth in advanced lung cancer. <br /></p><p>Over-activity of an enzyme (EZH2) which attaches methyl groups to histone proteins (overly methylates histones) silences surrounding tunour-suppressing genes. Their job is to stop uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. If they are silenced by methylation, cell growth becomes uncontrolled, resulting in tumours.</p><p>DNA-demethylating agents stop or reduce methylation resulting in allowing tumour suppressing genes to do their work in controlling cell growth (activate tumour-suppressor suppressing genes). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A possible reason why tumour cells are more susceptible to standard chemotherapy even when a drug is not directly effective on the tumour might be that epigenetic changes (such as Decitabine interfering with DNA methylation) are stable in mitosis and passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells; these changes can last beyond the period of drug treatment.</p><p>Epigenetic therapies can effect changes that stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells by slowing or advancing gene expression depending on the normal activity of the genes being acted on.</p><p>Two sensitive periods of cell development are when the embryo is developing and when germ cells are being created. At his time epigenetic marks and imprinting of genes are being established (also cleared and re-established). It would not be advisable to interfere with methylation and de-methylation at this time of development, because it could cause the cells to develop abnormally. </p></div>
