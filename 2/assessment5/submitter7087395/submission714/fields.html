    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>DNA
methylation of the genome in cancer is opposite that observed in normal cells.
In normal cells, the CpG islands are hypomethylated and the rest of the genome,
like the repetitive elements and intergenic elements are hypermethylated. In cancer cells,
the CpG islands are hypermethylated while the rest of the genome is
hypomethylated. This alteration of DNA methylation state can cause over
expression of certain genes (oncogenes) and silencing of others (tumour
suppressors), thus leading to cancer. ICRs also have altered methylation state
in cancer. Since many genes controlled by ICRs are related to cell growth, any
alterations in the activation state of these genes can disrupt cell growth and
be a contributing factor for cancer. Alterations in DNA methylation is one of
the first changes occurring in a cancer cell that progresses as the cancer
progresses. CpG islands are usually hypomethylated to allow activation of
gene promoters located in this region. Since most CpG islands are located in
the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes, hypermethylation of these regions
in cancer leads to silencing of these genes. This loss of function of tumour
suppressor genes can contribute to cancer (based on Kundson’s hypothesis).
Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated to prevent
illegitimate recombinations and disruption of other genes. However, in cancer
the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated which can
cause activation of repetitive elements that then jump around the genome and
disrupt other genes by positioning themselves in the middle of genes preventing
their downstream processing. Intergenic element hypomethylation can cause
improper alignment of the genes leading to illegitimate recombinations. The
resulting genomic instabilities can contribute to cancer. Since DNA methylation
is mitotically heritable, this methylation state can be passed on to the
daughter cells as well.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Imprinted genes are expressed from
only one of the parental alleles. If ICR disruption leads to silencing of the
gene from both the alleles instead of one, and if this is a tumour suppressor
gene, it can be contribute to cancer. If the ICR disruption results in the gene
expression from both alleles instead of one and if that gene was a potential
proto-oncogene, then this over-expression can contribute to cancer.  <span>IGF2 expression is controlled by the
methylation state of it’s ICR. In the paternal allele, the ICR is not
methylated and thus prevents CTCF binding. This then enables the distal
enhancers to act on IGF2 and increase it’s function. In the maternal allele, methylation
of the ICR causes CTCF binding to the ICR which blocks the distal enhancers
from activating IGF2 thus silencing it’s expression. Wilms tumor, a childhood
tumor occurs because of disruption of the H19/IGF2 cluster. In these patients the
maternal ICR allele is also unmethylated, preventing CTCF binding, thus
enabling the distal enhancers to activate IGF2 function in this allele as well,
similar to the paternal allele. Disruption of this cluster causes over epression
of IGF2, an oncogene, leading to excessive growth, a hallmark of cancer.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a
new class of epigenetic modifiers used to treat cancer. It is a DNA
demethylating drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed
to acute myeloid leukemia. Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA demethylators
i.e., it is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Decitabine causes demethylation
of DNA. Since it is a DNMT inhibitor, decitabine can block the action of DNMTs
and prevent DNA methylation from proceeding. It is a nucleoside analogue that
is incorporated in the DNA strand when administered. When DNMTs bind to the DNA for methylation
of the strands, it gets bound irreversibly to these nucleoside analogue drugs
and cannot be released and this prevents further methylation. Decitabine performs
it’s function by inhibition of DNA methylation only at low doses. Therefore
providing higher doses does not cause an effect on tumour cells. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic
phenomenon that occurs in both normal and cancer cells. Methylation alters the
activity state of the gene. The genome is usually hypomethylated at CpG islands
and hypermethylated at intergenic regions, repeats and introns. DNA methylation
is mitotically heritable and so the methylation state of a particular cell can
be passed on to the daughter cell following cell division and this can then
continue on. This DNA methylation is maintained by DNMT1 which recognizes
hemi-methylated parent DNA strand and methylates the newly formed DNA also.
Thus alterations in DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome. Sensitive
periods are usually periods at which the genome is most susceptible to damage. The
epigenetically sensitive periods include the period of germ cell development
and the stage following fertilization through to pre-implantation and
blastocyst stage. Sensitive periods are the times when the genome is most
susceptible to epigenomic alterations that could have lasting impacts on the
person and also affect the future generation. Thus, treating patients during
these sensitive periods is not advisable since, it could lead to epigenetic
changes in either the sperm/egg genome or in the developing embryo which could
be devastating. </p>
