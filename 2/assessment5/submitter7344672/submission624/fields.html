    <h1>Submission 624 from Anon (session_user_id: 2295c858fd57eb1c8de94bdbf59adad738b8a10f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated while
intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. On the other
hand, CpG islands become hypermethylated which can cause gene silencing especially
of the tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells. Furthermore, intergenic and
repetitive elements contribute to global hypomethylation which causes genomic
instability as evidenced by deletions, insertions, and recombinations between
repeats.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 and Igf2 are a cluster of imprinted genes which share
enhancers. In the paternal allele, the imprint control region or ICR is methylated
which blocks the binding of the CTCF insulator and allows the enhancers to act
on the Igf2 expression.  However, in the
maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated allowing the binding of the CTCF and
enhancers act on the expression of H19. Therefore, Igf2 is silent in the
maternal allele. In Wilm’s tumor, both ICRs from the maternal and paternal
alleles are hypermethylated which results to Igf2, a growth promoting gene, being
overexpressed. This also results to the silencing of the H19, a tumor suppressor
gene, in the maternal allele. Both the loss of a tumor suppressor gene and the
overexpression of a dose-dependent growth promoting gene are hallmarks of
cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. This drug is incorporated
into DNA and is thus, replication-dependent. Although the mechanisms of action
of decitabine are still not clearly known, it has been shown to bind to DNMTs
rendering them ineffective. Thus, methylation is lost in the process of
replication. Tumor suppressor genes then become reactivated or hypomethylated.
At the right dosage of decitabine, the disruption in DNA synthesis can control the
rapid proliferation of dividing cells as well as apoptotic activity which
eventually get rid of tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is irreversible and mitotically heritable which
makes it very attractive to utilize in cancer therapy.  In cancer, however, altering methylation
patterns may also cause gene expressions which are cancer-related. Also, DNA methylation
has a very important role in different cell functions thus, altering it may not
always give positive effects. This is particularly true in sensitive periods in
which development is vulnerable to a whole lot of environmental factors etc.
From the lectures, these were in the early and primordial germ cell
developments. These are critical periods in development that administering drugs
at this point may impede the initiation of genes needed for epigenetic reprogramming
and normal cell functions.</p></div>
