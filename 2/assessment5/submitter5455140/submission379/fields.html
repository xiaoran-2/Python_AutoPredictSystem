    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, the paternal allele is imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated, which avoids the binding of the insulator CTCF protein to bind the ICR. In this paternal allele, the enhancer region promotes the expression of Igf2 gene. On the other hand, the maternal allele ICR is unmethylated which allows CTCF binding, acting as an insulator, and therefore blocking the enhancer-driven expression of Igf2. In Wilm's tumor condition. there is a loss of imprinting control due to an abnormal hypermethylation of the maternal allele ICR, which leads to expression of a double dose of Igf2 (both the maternal and paternal allele). As Igf2 is growth-promoting, these cells will end up with an abnormal replication, leading to cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In general, DNA methyation of promoter regions is related with gene silencing, but CpG islands are usually unmethylated independently of the gene activation state. In cancer, CpG islands became hypermethylated, which results in a silencing of the genes, mostly the ones encoding tumor supressor genes. The fact that the tumor supressor genes are not expressed, together with overexpression of oncogenes, leads to an abnormal cellular growth and replication and therefore cancer progression. <br />Regarding the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, in normal cells these regions used to be methylated, while in cancer are hypomethylated. In normal cells, DNA methylation in these regions play a role in preservation of DNA stability, keeping the chromatin packed (heterochromatin), therefore avoiding events like illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats or transpositions.<br />On the other hand, in cancer, the intergenic regions, repetitive elements and poor-CpG promoters are hypomethylated, which promote expression of oncogenes, leading to cancer.  <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a nucleoside analogs that works as a demethylating agent. Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methytransferases (DMNTs). Once decitabine is incorporated to DNA, it irreversibly bind DNMTs, blocking its effects. During cancer, there is an abnormal DNA hypermethylation of tumor supressor genes, which blocks them, leading to enhanced cell division and growth. Decitabine might work by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA in cancer cells. Also it has been described that Decitabine works as antimetabolite chemotherapy agent. When cells incorporate Decitabine into the cellular metabolism, cell death is produced in the rapidly dividing cancer cells due to a cytotoxic effect. Althogether will result in a blockage of cell growth and/or cell death.  <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As the definition of epigenetics is "the study of heritable changes in gene activity not caused by changes in the DNA sequence" is likely that modifications of the epigenome can have enduring effects in later cell divisions. Examples like the role of DMNT1 in mainteining the methylation pattern after cell division support the idea that epigenetic drug-mediated treatments that might alter the epigenetic state of a cell can be manteined after the treatment in the offspring cells by the cellular machinery.  <br />A sensitive period in epigenetics is a period of epigenetic reprogramming with clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks where the cells are susceptible to enviromental signals. During development, the sensitive periods for the cells are<span> pre-implantation development and germ cell development.<br />During these periods is not recommended to treat patients with epigenetic drugs because you might change the normal and physiological epigenetic program, leading to cell alterations at several levels like gene expression, cell differentiation, imprinted genes, eu/heterochromatin structure, X chromosome inactivation and general cell function. <br /></span><br /></div>
