    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands inhibits gene expression in somatic mammalian cells. In cancer cells, promotor region of CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, which causes silencing of tumor supressor genes wthich are controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair (e.g. estrogen recepor, p53, BRCA1/2, Rb, or VHL). DNA methylation is mediated by DNA methylase, and abberations of specific type of DNA mathylase were found in cancer cells. For example, DNMT3a was found mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In such cancer cells, specific region of DNA is hypermethylated and then expression of tumor supressor genes are decreased.  On the other hands,depletion of other DNA methyl transferase, DNMT1 can enhance tumorigenesis by chromosomal instability.Therefore, effect of DNA methylation depletion is though to be stage specific (e.g. early vs late in tumorigenesis). DNA methylaion in interhenic regions and repetitive elements contribute on genomic instability. In cancer cells, hypomethylation in intergenic and repetitive regions is found, and that results in deletions, insertions or translocaton of cancer related genes. </p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the maternal allele, CTCF bound with H19 imprint control regions (ICR) insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Therefore, H19 but not IGF2 is not expressed from matternal allele. Meanwhile, in the paternal allele, DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding as well as H19 expression, and then downstream enhancers can promote Igf2 expression. In Wilm's tumor cells, loss of DNA methylation at ICRs of maternal allele is found, and that can result in overexpression of Igf2 and cause tumorgenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a chemical analogue of cytidine, and known as an DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Treatment of decitabine in cancer cells inhibits DNA methylation and result in tumor supression by induction tumor suppressor and pro-apoptotic genes. At present, the drug is used in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes in clinical practice.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In mammalian species, preconception and early development periods are the sensitive periods.Therefore, medication using the "epigenetin drugs" during the during (early) pregnancy critically alter epigenetic makeup and adult health, due to mitotic heritability of altered epigenetic state. For these reasons, such drug treatments during the sensitive periods are generally contraindicated.</div>
