    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In cancer, cell promoter CpG inslands tend to become very methylated, and that causes silencing of the genes that protect agains cancer. If you look at human DNA, intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences in repeats and remmants of retroviral insertions. Complex patterns of methylation have also been found in a number of regions which have been called, because of this feat, HypoMethylated Regions (HMRs). The exact mechanism about how it happens seems to be related with the modification of the 5th cytosine base of the DNA which is located ad 70 to 80% of the CpG dinucleotides. Genome-Wide tests provide information on these different epigenetic characteristics that are intimately related to cancer development.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomena by which some genes can be expressed in a parent-of-origin manner, that means, it is an inheritance process, related to gametogenic reprogramming, but independent of the classical Mendelian inheritance. How does that happen? In most autosomal genes both alleles are expressed, but in mamals, a small proportion of genes are imprinted, meaning that gene expression only occurs from one gene, and the expressed allele is dependent on its paternal origin. For example, in humans, the Insulin-like growth factor 2 gene (Igf2) is only expressed from the allele inherited from the father, while the H19 or CDKN1C are exoressed only in the non-imprinted allele inherited from the mother. Loss of expression of these tumor suppressor gene is related to more possibilities to develop cancer, specially ovarian and breast cancers.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hnypomethylating agent drug, that means that it works by switching off the DNA methyltranferase protein. This switches on genes that stop cancer cell growing and dividing. It is used specially to treat acute myeloid leukaemia, also with ovarian cancer, and is sold under the brand name Dacogen. Even in those patients who didn't get positive results from the drug alone, it seems that regular chemotherapy thereafter has been more effective, which suggests that there's at least some effect on the drug targeting the canceours cells, even the larger tumors.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Demethylating deugs seem to have a produced "memory" antitumor response that lasts for long periods of time. They also seem to alter gene activity in stem cell-like cancer cells, that are capable of self-renewal over the time. In this proces, they also seem to affect the structure of chromatin, the complex of DNA which conforms chromosomes, and that can have side effects over a long period of time. Sensitive periods are instants of time when DNA expression is more prone to undergo epigenetic changes. That can have an impact in many key areas like in brain development, thus, it can cause bad side effects. But, given its success as a cancer fighting agent, seems that the survival changes are worth the possible bad side effects.<br /></div>
