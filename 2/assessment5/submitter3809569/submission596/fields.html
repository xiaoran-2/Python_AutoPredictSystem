    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated, but in cancer cells are hypermethylated CpG islands, leading to the silencing of tumour suppressor genes. Tumour suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutation. Silencing a tumour suppressor is going to allow that particular cell to have a competitive advantage over the others in the surrounding tissues, then over a period of time, the cells that have this epimutation are more likely to divide more rapidly, or to not die as much. Over time as the cancer progresses, there are increased metylathion of CpG islands that are associated with tumour suppressors. This hypermethylation can occur because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable or deletion or loss of heterozygosity. Already in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in the normal cell and hypomethylated in cancer cells. These hypomethylation has a caonsequence depending on where it's happening. One of the functions of DNA metylation is to maintain genomic stability. In other words to make sure that genetically the genome was normal and we didn't lose chromosomes, gain choromosomes or have illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes they shouldn't occur. So then if have hypomethylation of repeats or intergenic intervals, then what end up having the consequence of this are illegitimate recombination between repeats. This can result in things like reciprocal translocations between two different chromosomes, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">One of the common features of cancer is they display loss of imprinting. In other words, genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent of origin specific expression. They're imprinted, no longer show this imprint of expression but rather they become either expressed from both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles. The reason this is found in cancer is probably because lots of genes that are imprinted are involved in growth. Either they're growth promoting or growth suppressing. It doesn't exclusively find hypermethylation of imprint control regions in cancer, can also find hypomethylation of imprint control regions. On the maternal allele, when the insulator is unmethylated CTCF is binds on the  insulator element, and it means that the enhancers will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so we don't see. On the paternal allele, when the insulator is methylated now the enhancers can act on Igf2, because CTCF is not binding to inhibit this, and Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. In Wilm's tumour occurs hypermethylation. On the maternal allele also have expression of Igf2. Now have doble dose of Igf2 in comparison to what you saw in a normal cell. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue cytosine hipometilante drug that, once incorporated into DNA, inhibits its methylation. Decitabine belongs to a new therapeutic class called methyltransferase inhibitors. Decitabine acts at the unmethylation CpG islands so that they return to the normal standard after the withdrawal or termination of the factor that changed the methylation standard of a given gene leading to its silencing. Tumor suppressor gene can again be active in transcription combating and preventing the development of tumors.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">After that epigenetic changes occurred, the daughter cells will also inherit this change, it is mitotically inheritable. Sensitive period considered is that between 9 and 12 years of age, at the moment what germ cells are being formed. Treatment of patients during this sensitive period is inadvisable because the drug will be passed to the germ cells, ie, the children will also receive this inheritance pattern. As the drug can act acting on other genes important for our health, this change will also be passed to the children if taken in sensitive period.</div>
