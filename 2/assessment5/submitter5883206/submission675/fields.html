    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in normal
cells accurse in locus specific DNA hypermethylation (CpG islands and CpG island
shores of tumour suppressor genes and ICR) and Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation
(Repetitive regions , introns, intergenic region and…). Methylation CpG island
causes silence genes. In normal cells CpG islands are hypomethlatin and repetitive
regions, introns, intergenic region are hypermethylated. But in cancer cell is <b><i>Vice versa.</i></b><b><i> </i></b><span>The epigenome
of cancer cells displays numerous alterations in comparison to the epigenome of
their normal counterpart. Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss
and a regional gain of DNA methylation.<b><i> </i></b>In cancer cells the CpG
islands and CpG island shores are to be hypermethylated that causes silences tumour suppressor (TSG) genes,
that controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. Consequence of Genome-wide hypomethylation depends on location: Repeats/ Intergenic regions: genomic
instability and CpG poor promoters: oncogene activation. the normal function of
DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is genome stability. In other words to make sure
that genetically the genome was normal and we didn't lose chromosomes, gain
chromosomes or have illegitimate recombinations. But hypomethylation of
repeats/ intergenic intervals cause genome instability by illegitimate
recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation
of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. In addition genome
instability cause disrupt TSGs and activation oncogenes.  </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine (Dacogen ) inhibits DNMT, induces global DNA
hypomethylation, and increases expression of specific genes through mechanisms
both dependent on as well as independent of promoter hypomethylation.
Decitabine in anti-tumor cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of
cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the
cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent
adducts between DNA
methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA.
Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. <br /></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>On the maternal chromosome, imprinting control
region (ICR) is unmethylated, allowing it to bind CTCF insulator protein. This
prevents the Igf2 gene from accessing the enhancer, and so the enhancer drive H19
expression. On the paternal chromosome, methylation of the ICR prevents the
binding of CTCF, thereby allowing Igf2 to 
outcompete H19 for access to the enhancer. One of  the common features of the cancer cells is they
display loss of imprinting. Therefor genes should be displaying monoallelic,
parent of origin expression, they display either expressed from both parent
alleles or silenced from both parent alleles. However loss of imprinting and
hyper methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele leading to expression of
Igf2 on the maternal allele. So we have double dose of Igf2. Igf2 is an
important fetal growth stimulatory factor, this is associated with Wilm’s
tumour, which is a ligand for the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (Igf-IR).
Igf-IR is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase linked to the RAS-RAF- MAPK cascade
and the PI3 kinase cascade, and its activation results in both cell cycle
progression and protection from apoptosis. So loss of imprinting accurses in
very early, often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue.</span><span> </span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike other forms of gene regulation, epigenetic changes are
passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they
are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might
therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing
without having to kill all its cells. Although DNA methylation is a very
stable epigenetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent cell generations,
reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during gametogenesis and after
fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). The epigenetic drugs during embryogenesis is
particularly important in establishing epigenetic marks, because reprogramming
occurs shortly after fertilization and during germ cell differentiation. The epigenetic
drugs can impact methylation and demethylation and can have effects well beyond
the developmental period.</p>
