    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation functions in normal cell regulatory processes governing gene expression. CpGs are generally <b>hypermethylated</b> throughout the genome of normal cells and methylation is maintained through mitotic division. CpGs are more densley concentrated in gene promoters, and regions of higher incidence of CpGs are referred to as CpG islands (CGI). CGIs are generally hypomethylated, however when they are methylated, their role is almost universally associated with transcriptional silencing of the downstream gene. </p><p>In most cancer cells, distinct subsets of promoter associated CGIs and CpG island shores are <strong>more likely to be methylated</strong> and changes to methylation patterns in CGIs can be observed as <strong>increasing hypermethylation </strong>as the disease progresses. Because CGIs are found in the promoters of particular tumor suppressor genes, their silencing or inactivation caused by methylation of CGIs, is one mechanism whereby control is disrupted. Because tumor suppressor genes are no longer active, the cancer cell will not only live rather than dying, it will have a competitive advantage over normal cells and further, the epimutation is maintained through subsequent cell divisions, maintaining the malignant state of the cancer lineage. </p><p>In normal cells, CpGs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally hypermethylated genome wide. In intergenic regions of normal cells, hypermethlation is important in imprint control regions as well as in silencing CpG poor promoters. Hypomethylation of these regions observed in <b>cancer cells</b> can result in activation of growth promoting oncogenes normally silenced by methylation and other changes to chromatin structure where loss of methylation affects regions normally transcriptionally silenced through chromatin condensation. </p><p>Methylation in RIs contributes to transcriptional silencing and helps maintain genomic stability. Unmethylated, (therefore active) repetitive elements with strong promoters in cancer cells can be disruptive by transposing themselves into other regions of the genome and altering transcription of other genes, and by causing translocations and other <b>genetic mutations</b> . </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The IGF2 gene codes for human like insulin growth factor II and in cases of Wilm's tumor, imprinting is disrupted and the gene is overexpressed. This is due to abherrent activation of the usually repressed maternally inherited allele of the IGF2 gene.</p><p>The imprint control region of the <b>paternal</b> allelle of the IGF2/H19 cluster is <b>methylated in normal cells. </b> IGF2 is expressed from the paternal chromosome because the H19 promoter region of the gene is methylated at CGIs which silences it by<strong> blocking CTCF binding</strong> which allows enhancers to access and <strong>activate IGF2 expression</strong>.</p><p>In the <b>maternal</b> allelle of the IGF2/H19 cluster, there is <b>no methylation</b> at the H19 promoter. The expression of H19 allows binding of the CTCF insulator protein to the ICR, blocking of enhancers and consequent <strong>inhibition of expression of IGF2</strong> from the maternal allele.</p><p>In cells from patients with Wilm's tumour, there is a loss of imprinting and therefore <strong>hypermethylation at ICRs</strong>. The <b>maternal allele</b> of the IGF2H19 cluster is now <b>hypermethylated</b> at the promoter, leading to IGF2 expression on BOTH the maternal and paternal alleles. </p><p>The disruption of imprinting at this cluster leads to an increase in the expression of IGF2 which is a growth promoting factor and since this is produced in elevated amounts, it contributes to tumorogenisis observed in Wilm's tumor cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Dacogen) belongs to a class of <b>hypomethylating </b>agents and acts to inhibit DNA methyltrasferase. It does so because 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine is a cytosine analogue. During cell replication, the analogue is incorporated into the new DNA strand, and after replication, when DNMT1 binds to the cytosine analogue to copy the methylation pattern to the daughter strand, it is irreversibly bound to the analogue and cannot maintain the methylation pattern on the new DNA. In replicating cells, this will eventually reverse abherant hypermethylation at the CGIs.</p><p>It is the hypermethylation of the CGIs in tumor suppressor genes of MDS cells that Decitabine has been successfully used to target in myeloplastic syndromes. In tumorogeninsis, where rapid rates of cell division occur, removing the hypermethylation can restore lower cell replication rates, reprograming cancer cells rather than killing them. Low (therefore less toxic) doses of Decatabine are effective, reducing side effects.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are several mechanisms by which cancer drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond treatment. DNA methylation is a stable,<strong> mitotically heritable epigenetic mark</strong>, so therapy which targets and alters DNA methylation may be maintained in all cells in which it is altered, beyond the influence of the drug. It is observed that after epigenetic drugs, standard chemotherapy can be used in lower doses with greater effect. Long term effects may be positive, but there are risks, especially in the treatment of younger younger patients. transgenerational inheritance of aberrant epigenetic markers could be a long term consequence of broadly targeted therapy which is not tissue specific. </p><p>It is important to avoid treatment with epigenetic drugs during developmentally "<strong>sensitive periods</strong>". Also known as "<strong>critical remethylation periods</strong>", these are periods of active remodeling of the genome. One such period occurs at the pre and early post implantation in early embryogenesis where epigenetic marks are cleared and reset between generations. This occurs to erase acquired epigenetic changes to restore totipotency of the gamete. Another sensitive period occurs in early puberty during primordial germ cell development. DNA methylation patterns are erased and reestablished based on the sex of the transmitting parent. So pre and early pregnancy or puberty would be developmentally sensitive periods where epigenetic cancer therapy would be inadvisable.</p><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>
