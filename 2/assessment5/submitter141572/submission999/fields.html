    <h1>Submission 999 from Anon (session_user_id: 4ec39fca3b945f0710837fea4d98615964297b37)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor, used against Myelodysplastic syndrome. It is a nucleoside analogue <br />and is built into the new DNA at cell division. There it binds irreversibly to the methylation enzyme <br />DNMT and inhibits methylation of the new DNA. The new cell will thereby get a lower degree of methylation <br />(become demethylated), which seems to be a good thing since the cancer cells have high CpG island <br />hypermethylation.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell the CpG islands, in both active and inactive promoters, are usually <br />not methylated. In cancer cells some of these promoter CpG islands become hypermethylated, <br />with silencing of the associated gene as result. If this gene is a tumour suppressor its <br />silencing will contribute to the cancer growth.<br /><br />In intergenic regions and repetitive elements the CpGs are usually methylated in the normal cell.<br />In cancer cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated. This <br />hypomethylation causes genomic instability due to insertions, deletions and translocations.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster the paternal allele is methylated at the imprint control region <br />(ICR), which prevents the protein CTCF to bind to the ICR. (The allele also gets <br />methylated at the H19 promoter, which silences the expression of H19.) Since CTCF <br />cannot bind to the ICR the downstream enhancers will reach and activate Igf2.<br /><br />The maternal allele is not methylated, which allows CTCF to bind to the ICR. CTCF then <br />blocks the downstream enhancers from reaching Igf2, thereby silencing Igf2.<br /><br />If the maternal allele becomes hypermethylated (the ICR becomes methylated), as it is<br />in Wilm's tumour, it will behave like the paternal allele and activate Igf2. <br /><br />When the Igf2 becomes active in both alleles there will be an overexpression of <br />the growth factor Igf2, which stimulates the cancer growth.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since DNA methylation is mitotic heritable, changes during drug treatment can last through<br />many cell divisions, possibly for the cell line's life span.<br /><br />Those periods when an extensive reprogramming of the epigenetic marks occurs are called <br />sensitive periods. These sensitive periods are during germ cell development and early embryonic <br />development. During these periods any treatment that will make or block changes to the epigenetic <br />marks will disturb the normal changing process, and these disturbances can then last for the life <br />time.<br /><br /></div>
