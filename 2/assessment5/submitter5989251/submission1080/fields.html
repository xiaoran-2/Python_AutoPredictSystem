    <div class="field-value">In cancer, rather than having the same sort of DNA methylation makeup as you do in a normal cell. They're actually global, changes in DNA methylation. What happens in the case of cancer is that these intergenic intervals, and their repetitive elements now tend to be unmethylated. We also find some particular instances that CpG islands are hypermethylated, that is they're methylated when they shouldn't be. DNA methyltransferase one, this DNA methyltransferase which recognizes the hemi methylated DNA upon replication.<br />If it wasn't in the nucleus, or it wasn't being, wasn't being expressed, it wasn't being made by the cells. Then this would passively lead to demethylation. Passive demethylation which could occur without DNMT one. Requires that the DNA be replicated, and then you fail to maintain the methylation. And so, eventually with replication, you passively dilute out the DNA methylation. DNA methylation occurs predominantly at CpG dinucleotides in mammals. It's associated with gene silencing, if it's found in the promoters. It helps to maintain genomic stability in several different ways. It's laid down by the DNA methyltransferases, and is mitotically heritable because of the features of one of these DNMT1. And it can be removed either passively, or actively through the TET proteins. What's more, DNA<br />methylation is essential for life, essential for viability of a cell.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the patternal allele when this imprint control region is methlyated CTCF can now no longer bind. And if CTCF isn't binding and there is no insulator action then these enhancers are indeed free to act on Igf2, promote Igf2's expression from the paternal allele. Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele and not the maternal allele. But the reason that H19 is now no longer active on the paternal allele is because of heterochromatin spreading, or DNA methylation spreading, in this case, which I mentioned last week. <br />So this DNA methylation that's found at the imprint control region can spread downstream into the H19 promoter.When it becomes methylated, it is silenced because it's a CPG island promoter. This methylation is indeed synonymous with gene silencing. Two clusters, which are closely linked, can be disrupted in a disorder known as Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome. And it can result from a large number of different abnormalities that are found in this particluar region of chromosome 11. Chromosome 11 q15.5 and normally its by, some abrogation to this whole region which is about one megabase in size. These disruptions lead to problems with both Kcnq1 cluster expression and the Igf2/H19 cluster expression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. Appears to be what is happening in the case of GSK2816126. If it is, it would truly be a conceptual breakthrough, and epigenetics might justly take its place alongside genetics in the analysis and treatment of cancer.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">We know that the current options for drugs for cancer patients already give them a horrible array of side effects. And so, it's not necessarily true that we can predict what side effects might be just by thinking about a drug, rather you need to try.And really, the primary aim is to get patient survival, so while we want to minimize side effects, the primary aim is patient survival. So if epigenetic drugs may in fact extend the survival period, then they would still be a very god thing. And then sometimes, it, at least for adult cancers, the long term consequences of the use of these drugs is usually not considered. This is considered for childhood tumors but the long term consequences of the drug that you might give to somebody whose already quite elderly, so many patients with myelodysplastic syndrome are in their 70s. We don't necessary think so much or clinicians don't think so much about these long term consequences but rather extending the lifespan and the quality of life of these patients. So, to begin with these drugs have been targeting the enzymatic epigenetic regulators. <br /><br /><br /></div>
