    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">There are specific patterns in the normal cells and their DNA methylation. The function of DNA methylation is control (repressing) the expression of the genes. DNA methylation in cancer is disrubted because of a deregulation in the responsible enzymes and genes that control these proteins. Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer because a lot of genes are overexpressed and cause desregulation in the normal function of the cell. The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is silence this fragements and form heterochromatin. DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer because the critic enzymes do not work well or supressed. In intergenic regions and repetitive elements could be sequences that encode any type of sequence or can modify the expression of the proteins where they are found. This two mechanisms could contribute to the developmento of
cancer.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabina is a  DNA-demethylating agent.  It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting the enzyme DNA methyltransferase. With this drug cells can revert the overmethylation that takes place in tumor cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic modifications are passed on during the process of cell division to daugther and granddaugther cells. Then this marks are actively erased but they can <span>engage a specific gene expression</span> that makes an enduring response. The sensitive periods are point in the cycle of the cells when a lot of epigenetic modifications take place. Sensitive periods of development are first stages of embryonic development and during the childhood and adolescence. Treating patients during sensitive period would be inadvisable because can be a lot of changes that can modify drastically the gene expression of the cell.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
