    <div class="field-value">CpG islands (CGI) generally found in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes are normally hypomethylated allowing the expression of these genes. In cancer cells frequently there is hypermethylation of CGIs blocking the expression of the tumor suppressor genes. CGI hypermethylation features : possible one of the hits in Knudson hypothesis (often more frequent than mutation) ; mitotically heritable ; reversibility (unlike mutation) ; tumor type specific genome distribution ; progression with time ; can be used as single cancer cell biomarkers with relevance in diagnosis , prognosis , treatment .<br />Normally CpGs in repeats/intergenic regions are methylated , thus contributing to genomic stability. In cancer cells there is a genomic-wide hypomethylation leading to genomic instability by : ilegitimate recombination between repeats and transposition ; activation of cryptic promoters ; disruption of neighbour genes (in the case of repeats hypomethylation) , or activation of some genes (e.g.,R-RAS, microRNA 21,PTEN) (in the case of CpG poor promoter hypomethylation)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, in Igf2/H19 cluster ICR is hypermethylated on the paternal allele and hypomethylated on the maternal allele . As a result , the enhancers on the maternal allele are allowed to act on H19  , but not on Igf2 (which is silenced) , while on the paternal allele enhancers can act on Igf2  but cannot act on H19 (which is silenced) .So, normally Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele.<br /><br />In cancer cells of Wilms tumor with loss of imprinting on the maternal allele because of hypermethylation of ICR on this allele too , there is also expression of Igf2 on both alleles (so, double dose) favoring growth promotion and appearance of Wilms tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent which act by inhibiting DNA-methyltransferases.<br />It is used in myelodysplastic syndromes to demethylate the CpG islands in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes , thus enabling the expression of these genes and limiting the proliferation of cancer cells .</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Azacitidine is DNA-demethylating agents which has hypomethylation effect on CGIs in the promoter regions of some tumor suppresssor genes and this effect is mitotically heritable conferring durability to this effect. Treatment with drugs that target the epigenome during the sensitive periods of embryonic preimplantation or primary germ cell formation (mid-gestation) when the epigenome is reseting  is not recommended because of unkown and possible extensive effects. </div>
