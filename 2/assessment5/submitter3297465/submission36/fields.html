    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>In general, CpG islands in a normal cell are
unmethylated.  In a cancer cell, there is
hypermethylation of CpG islands.  This
CpG island hypermethylation contributes to cancer because when a tumor
suppressor gene becomes hypermethylated, the gene is silenced, the tumor
suppressor is no longer produced, and thus a tumor becomes more likely to
develop if cell growth is not restrained by other factors.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In a normal cell, the repetitive elements and intergenic
regions of the DNA are generally methylated. 
In a cancer cell, there is hypomethylation of the repetitive elements
and intergenic regions.  The
hypomethylation of the repetitive elements or intergenic regions can contribute
to cancer through multiple modes of action.</p>

<p> </p>

<span>Firstly, if the repetitive elements are not
silenced through methylation, they can be reactivated as transposable elements
that will make copies of themselves and insert themselves throughout the
genome.  This could result in cancer if,
for example, the transposon inserts itself into the coding region of a tumor
suppressor gene, rendering it nonfunctional. 
It could result in cancer in a second scenario where the repetitive
element that becomes unmethylated has a strong promoter that aberrantly
activates a neighboring oncogene that would otherwise remain silenced.  In a third scenario, it could lead to cancer
through illegitimate recombination between repetitive elements or intergenic
regions.  Normally, illegitimate
recombination wouldn’t occur between repetitive elements or the intergenic
regions because they are methylated and inaccessible in heterochromatin.  However, if they become hypomethylated, then
it becomes more possible for illegitimate recombination to occur.  When genes are moved around due to illegitimate
recombination, it may lead to aberrant levels of gene expression, which could
possibly result in cancer.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2
cluster is methylated at the imprint control region (ICR), and methylation is
also spread to the promoter of the nearby H19 gene.  The methylation at the paternal ICR prevents
the CTCF insulator protein from binding there, which means that the nearby Igf2
gene is not insulated from downstream enhancers, and thus Igf2 is expressed
from the paternal allele.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In a normal cell, the maternal allele of the H19/Igf2
cluster is unmethylated at its ICR, which means that CTCF can bind there to
insulate the nearby Igf2 gene from the downstream enhancers, and thus Igf2 is <i>not</i> expressed from maternal allele.  (The maternal allele is also unmethylated at
the promoter of the H19 gene, so the nearby enhancers act instead upon the H19
gene, and H19 is expressed from the maternal allele.)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In a Wilm’s tumour cell, both the maternal and paternal
alleles are methylated at the ICR (and the H19 promoter) of the H19/Igf2
cluster.  This leads to expression of
Igf2 from both the maternal and paternal alleles, and it is this over-expression
of a growth factor that leads to the uncontrolled growth of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor
(DNMTi) class of epigenetic inhibitors.  Decitabine
can inhibit DNA methylation, although this effect depends upon cellular
replication.  After the cell divides,
when a DNMT arrives to copy the DNA methylation mark onto the daughter strand
of DNA, Decitabine irreversibly binds the DNMT to inhibit its action, and thus
the newly replicated cells will be hypomethylated.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect if it is
introduced into a tumour cell that became a tumour cell due to hypermethylation
of tumour-suppressor genes.  This may
correct the hypermethylation at the problematic loci, and thus slow the growth
of the tumour.  Because Decitabine (and similar
DNMTi drugs) are dependent upon cellular replication, they will have the
strongest immediate effect on tumour cells, which divide rapidly.  Normal cells will also be exposed, but
because they don’t divide as rapidly, they won’t experience such strong
immediate effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so all of the
cells that originate from a cell with an altered state of DNA methylation will
retain that altered epigenetic state throughout the lineage of that
differentiated cell type.  A single
exposure to epigenetic-altering drugs is sufficient to bring about a persistent
altered state.  (See Q3 answer above for
DNMTi mode of action.)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A sensitive period is a time period during which many epigenetic
marks are reset during an organism’s natural course of development.  Sensitive periods of development in humans
are early embryogenesis and primordial germ cell development.  This epigenetic resetting allows for
pluripotency in these cell types, and also for correct imprinting in the
gametes.  However, methylation of the
repeats (such as transposable elements) should be maintained during both
sensitive periods, and methylation at the imprinted genes needs to be
maintained during early embryogenesis.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Treatment with epigenetic-altering drugs would be
inadvisable in patients who are pregnant or planning to have children, because
this would disrupt the normal epigenetic reprogramming in the germ cells and
the developing embryo.  Treatment with a
DNMTi during pregnancy would harm the developing embryo, as DNMT1 is required
to maintain methylation in the differentiated cells.</p></div>
