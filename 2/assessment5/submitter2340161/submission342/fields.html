    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands involves hypomethylation at the CpG island and hypermethylation at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Cancer cells reverse this - they have hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, and hypermethylation at the CpG islands. The disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer in that it suppresses expression of the tumour supressor genes. Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to cancer by allowing genomic instability, which results in illegitimate recombination of repeats, activation and transposition of repeats, and activation of cryptic promoters.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A typical paternal allele is methylated at the ICR, preventing the binding of CTCF and allowing the enhancers to act on the Igf2 region, causing its expression. A typical maternal allele is not  methylated at the ICR, allowing the binding of CTCF and allowing the enhancers to act on the H19 region, causing its expression. Wilm's tumour resluts when both alleles are methylated, resulting in a double dose of Igf2, which is growth promoting. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a </span>DNA-demethylating agent, which means that it decreases the frequency of hypermethylation. This could have the effect of slowing tumor growth, or even potentially stopping it, since the epigenetic changes would be mitotically heritable.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, because the effects are mitotically heritable. Treating patients during sensitive periods, such as adolescence and during or near pregnancy, because at these timed the germ cells are undergoing epigenetic reprogramming. This means changes to the cells at the time might be transferred to offspring in an inappropriate way.<br /><br /></div>
