    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations
in DNA methylation are one of the most frequently observed
aberrations in epigenetic control in cancer. In particular, DNA
methylation is disrupted in cancer in two different and opposite
ways, such as the hypermethylation of CpG islands and the
hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions.<br />In
normal conditions, there is no methylation at CpG islands. In
contrast, in a cancer cell, the CpG islands are more likely to be
methylated (even if all of them are not necessarily methylated).
Given that CpG islands are mostly found in the promoter region of
tumour
supressors
and that, by definition, DNA methylation results in gene
transcriptional silencing, tumour supressor
genes are consequently silenced due to DNA methylation. This
silencing process is very effective since DNA methylation is
mitotically heritable. However, DNA methylation is not sufficient for
cancer to occur but it can be one of the hits "necessary"
to cause cancer genesis.<br />On
the other hand, in cancer cells repetitive elements and intergenic
regions are hypomethylated whereas in normal conditions they are
usually methylated. DNA hypomethylation occurs genome-wide, in almost
all tumours. It commonly occurs more in repeats and intergenic
regions than anywhere else in the genome. Given
that one of the most important functions of DNA methylation is to
guarantee genomic stability by avoiding
illegitimate recombination or activation of repeats. In cancer cells, this
stability is lost due to DNA hypomethylation. The genetic instability
can induce the illegitimate recombination, insertion or
deletion between repeats, since they are not densely
packaged in the heterochromatin. Repeats can also be activated due to
hypomethylation, allowing them to make a copy of themselves and
jump around the genome. This results in the disruption of the coding
region of genes or the activation of neighboring<span>
genes. Thus tumorigenesis is enhanced by this genomic instability.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of imprinting is commonly observed in cancer cells. This means that genes that would display monoallelic parent of origin specific expression no longer show this imprinted expression but they become either expressed or silenced in both paternal and maternal alleles. Alterations of  the methylation of Imprinted Control Regions (ICR) are found in cancer, probably because most imprinted genes are involved in growth. Depending on the ICR, they can be hypermethylated or hypomethylated. A common example is found in the H19/Igf2 cluster, where the ICR is usually methylated on the paternal allele, allowing the enhancers to act on Igf2 and then Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. In contrast, the ICR  is usually unmethylated on the maternal allele, so that CTCF binds its insulator element and then the enhancers act on H19 and Igf2 is silenced. <br />However, in Wilm's tumour cells, there is a loss of imprinting so that there is hypermethylation of the ICR, also on the maternal allele, resulting on a double dose of Igf2 since it is expressed on both alleles. As a result of this, the expression of H19, which is believed to act as a tumour suppressor, is down regulated. This consequently enhances tumorigenesis. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of DNA is a major mechanism that silences gene expression in cells. In cancer, tumour suppressor genes are often hypermethylated , which results in the blockage of the activity of these genes,  inducing tumorigenesis. </p><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs known as DNA de-methylating agents because they inhibits DNA methylation. <br /></p><p>Decitabine binds to DNA methyltransferases, the enzymes catalyzing DNA methylation, and inhibits them. Thus DNA methylation is as well inhibited and the silencing of certain genes no longer occurs. </p><p>As a result of this, the expression of tumour suppressor genes, that were previously hypermethylated and then silenced,  is restored. The normal anti-tumour function of tumour suppressor genes is consequently restored. Tumour suppressor genes prevent normal cells to cancer by restricting tumour cell cycle progression (proliferation) and consequently inhibiting tumour development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">An epigenetic alteration will have an enduring effect on the epigenome,  if it occurs during sensitive periods and there is mitotic heritability. <br />In particular DNA methylation is mitotically heritable or stable. This means that DNA methylation is passed down through cell division and remains stable in somatic cells. If DNA methylation is altered during a sensitive period and is mitotically inherited trough cell division, it will consequently have a long-term effect on the epigenome and may produce consequences on the organism. <br /><br />A sensitive period is a period of undefined time during which the organism is more susceptible to epigenetic changes.  The most sensitive period is the period of germ cell development that  usually corresponds to embryogenesis and early life (pregnancy and first days of life, when germ cells are still developing). <br /><br />It is strongly inadvisable to treat younger patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods, because the "lasting effect" of these drugs will not alter the epigenetics of only tumour cells but also of all the remaining cells and that could have fatal consequences on the organism that can include anomalous brain development or alterations in the immune function</div>
