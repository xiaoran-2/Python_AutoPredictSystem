    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at the promoter region of a gene is generally associated with gene silencing. An extensive methylation of this region (at the 5' end of the strand) prevents promoter proteins from binding to start transcription. <i><br /><br /></i>About 60% of promotor regions contain (or are near) CpG islands that are highly dense in cytosine and guanine residues. The CpG islands are normally free of methylation regardless of the associated gene's transcription activity state. In cancer, however, there is <strong>hypermethylation at the CpG islands</strong>, effectively silencing a class of genes called, "tumor supressor genes". <i><br /></i><br />Contrarily, in the intergenic regions and in repetitive elements, the normal state is a high degree of methylation to suppress expression of remnants of retroviral elements and multiple starts by highly active genes. A disruption in this methylation state to <strong>hypomethylation of these intergenic regions and repetitive elements make the genome unstable globally</strong>, causing proliferation of expression of oncogenes in some cancers.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Expression of H19 and IGF2 (neighboring genes on chromosome 11) are regulated by genomic imprinting, a differential expression of a gene by epigenetic state or process. <br /></p>Normally, paternal allele of the H19 gene is methylated at the promoter region and this causes silencing of expression. On the other hand, maternal allele is  not methylated (or hypomethylated) and H19 is expressed in subsequent offspring cells after mitotic division. Therefore, methylation of the promoter region of H19 gene is negatively associated with expression of H19. <br /><br />H19 gene codes for a long noncoding (lnc) RNA (i.e., no protein product) that has a deregulating effect (i.e., decrease in expression) on IGF2 gene that codes for a growth-promoting factor that is often associated with various cancers. That is, IGF2 is an oncogene. The IGF2 gene is also imprinted but with an active paternal allele (not methylated) and silent maternal allele (methylated). <br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, imprinting is disrupted at H19/IGF2 cluster which results in the decreased production of H19 lncRNA (acting as a tumor supressor) and an increased production of IGF2 factor (oncogene product). This is due to the fact that the maternal allele of IGF2 becomes active due to loss of imprinting. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <i><b>DNA-demethylating agent </b></i>that is used to treat a precursor condition to myelogenous leukemia, known as myelodysplastic syndromes. In this condition, there is a hypermethylation and thus silencing of tumor suppressing genes. The hypermethylation activity could occur to regions such as the CpG islands discussed in Q#1, or possibly to histone residues (resulting in chromatin remodeling) and these reactions are catalyzed by a class of enzymes called methyltransferases.<br /></p><p><span>The impact of decitabine on DNA methylation is to inhibit overactive methyltransferases. While the specific mechanism of how decitabine acts to treat cancer was not discussed, effectively, inhibition of these enzymes results in reversing of silencing of tumor suppressing genes. Subsequently, these genes are transcribed, producing tumor suppressing factors that stop the uncontrolled growth of cancerous cells.<br /></span></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><i></i></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dr. Baylin's study showed that patients with solid tumors responded better to standard chemotherapy after showing little effect in a study where they were initially treated with "epigenetic drugs".  He hypothesizes that altering DNA methylation, it can have enduring effects on the epigenome of those genes that are involved in transcription factors such as the ones for tumor suppressor genes. The reason for the enduring effect is that the parent somatic cells pass on their methylation states very faithfully to their subsequent daughter cells. This explains why standard chemotherapy (which acts to kills cancerous cells) coupled with reactivation of tumor suppressing genes had greater treatment success in reducing sold tumors.<br /><br />Generally, DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark, which is stably copied on to subsequent generations after cell division.<br /><br />A <strong>sensitive period</strong> is during periods of cell formation and maturation where there is reprogramming of DNA methylation such as during gametogenesis and induction of pluripotency in somatic stem cells.<br /><br />It is not advisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because these drugs can unpredictably disrupt the normal process of methylation/demethylation and imprinting that can permanently alter the character of subsequent offspring cells (resulting in unacceptable side effects). </div>
