    <div class="field-value">In cancer overall DNA methylation is reduced across the genome but increased at CpG islands (CGIs) of tumor suppressor genes.  DNA methylation at a CGI promoter silences the gene so normally such methylation only occurs at CGIs of genes that must be silenced as a part of the normal functioning cell cycle and metabolism.  In cancer DNA methylation of CGIs occur abundantly at tumor suppressor genes, silencing them, often more frequently than genetic mutation, are ubiquitous in all types of tumor cells and increase in degree with cancer progression.  Silencing these genes has a twofold effect; it blocks one of the body's  mechanisms to keep cancer from developing and spreading and because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and epimutations are rapidly and preferentially selected, it accelerates cancer growth.  In some clinically distinct cancers hypermethylation of CGIs occurs in sets of genes, CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). Also when CGI hypermethylation occurs it's accompanied by hypermethylation 2kb upstream and downstream of the CGIs.  <br /><br />Under normal healthy conditions DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements play critical roles in maintaining genomic stability.  Specifically, methylation at these locations prevent; illegitimate recombination of repeats that are bound by heterochromatin, activation and transposition of repeats and subsequent activation of cryptic promoters that can lead to genetic deletions, insertions and reciprocal transpositions and disruption of neighboring genes normal necessary functions or expression of oncogenes.  In cancer, besides the activation of oncogenes, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated so these aberrant processes are not stopped and genomic instability results; a requirement and hallmark of cancer.  As with CGI hypermethylation, these occurrences of hypomethylation are ubiquitous in all types of tumor cells and increase in degree with cancer progression.  <br /><br />All information obtained from class video lectures, Week Seven, Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression, May-June 2014<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Cancer disrupts imprinting by both hypermethylation and hypomethylation of the imprint control regions (IRCs) of gene clusters thereby either silencing growth restricting genes or over expressing growth promoting genes.  It's very common to see loss of imprinting in cancerous cells.  It's a diagnostic early feature seen in pre-neoplastic tissues.  <br /><br />Normally in the H19/Igf2 gene cluster, the IRC and the H19 promoter are hypermethylated on the paternal allele so the enhancers act on Igf2 and it's expressed while H19 isn't expressed.  At the same time the IRC on the maternal allele is unmethylated because it's covered by an insulating protein, CTCF, so the enhancers act on H19 and it's expressed while Igf2 isn't expressed. <br /><br />When imprinting is lost in this cluster, the IRC is methylated on both the paternal and maternal alleles resulting in a double expression of Igf2 which is a growth promoting gene and creates Wilm's tumor, a childhood kidney cancer.  All cancers are characterized by uncontrolled cell growth.  In this cluster over expression of Igf2, a growth promoting gene, leads to cancer.  <br /><br />All information obtained from class video lectures, Week Seven, Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression, May-June 2014<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia (2012, The Economist).  Unlike genetic mutations, epimutations are reversible and therefore a viable approach of drug therapy.  Specifically, Decitabine targets DNMT1, a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), the enzymes that catalyze, or in the case of the drug, inhibit DNA methylation.  It acts as nucleoside analog, binding to DNMT1 in the process of cell division and incorporation into DNA.  Thus, where the cells are rapidly dividing in a tumor, demethylation occurs the fastest and the tumor cells die.  But DNA demethylation is only effective at a therapeutic dose which is relatively low compared with toxic levels.  Because normal cells divide slowly, long term effects are unknown.  Besides demethylation, other mechanisms of action are also unknown.  <br /><br /> (2012, 7th April). <a title="Link: http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">Cancer's epicentre</a>. The Economist.<br />Class video lectures, Week Seven, Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression, May-June 2014<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable whatever changes occur in DNA methylation will be passed down to successive generations of somatic cells.  If an epigenetic drug reduces DNA methylation to stop the progression of cancer, demethylation will persist in that tissue as new cells continuously overturn until it's eliminated.  <br /><br />There are two sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming during which the epigenome is extraordinarily vulnerable to alteration and damage.  These are during early embryonic preimplantation development and during gametogenesis.  The entire epigenome is undergoing reprogramming to establish new epigenetic marks that will be maintained for the life of the individual or the gametes. By the the blastocyst stage all of the epigenetic marks are cleared and new ones are established within days at the epiblast stage.  Gametogenesis begins with primordial germ cell development during embryonic development and continues through complete maturation of the gametes.  <br /><br />Any therapeutic modification of the epigenome during these periods will inevitably be damaging because drugs that alter epigenetic marks in cancerous tissues will be unrestricted to do so elsewhere.  The most vulnerable cells will be the first to be changed.  <br /><br />Class video lectures, Weeks Five/Seven, Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression, May-June 2014<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
