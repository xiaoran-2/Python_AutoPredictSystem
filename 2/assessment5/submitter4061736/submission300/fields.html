    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value">Alterations in DNA methylation at imprint control regions (ICRs) results in loss of imprinting. one example of this is the H19/Igf2 cluster.  The H19/ Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted. In normal cells the paternal allele is methylated at the ICR. This DNA methylation at the ICR blocks binding of CTCF protein. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, this silences H19 expression and allows downstream enhancers to access Igf2, activating Igf2 expression. The maternal allele is normally unmethylated, this allows CTCF to bind to the ICR. H19 long non coding RNA is expressed and the downstream enhancers are unable to activate Igf2, which therefore remains silenced from this allele. In Wilm's tumour (childhood kidney tumour) there is hypermethylation at this ICR and methylation occurs on the maternal allele as well as the paternal allele, thus preventing CTCF binding, H19 expression and allowing the downstream enhancers to activate Igf2, leading to a double dose of Igf2 being produced. This leads to increased cell growth due to overexpression of this growth promoting gene and therefore contributes to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-value"><p> Methylation of 5'group of cytosine occurs almost solely within CpG dinucleotides. DNA methylation at the promoter region usually decreases the chances of the gene being expressed, with the exception of CpG islands which are usually kept free of methylation independent of there activity, (Hassler and Egger, 2012). In cancer CpG islands become increasingly hypremethylated in tumour suppressor genes, this contributes to cancer by decreasing expression of these genes, suppressing there regulatory gene function to keep cell growth in check.  The rest of the genome is usually hypermethylated in normal cells, this includes intergenic regions and repetitive elements acting to silence expression in these areas. In cancer these areas become increasingly demethylated, gradually becoming hypomethylated as the cancer progresses. This contributes to cancer by allowing this regions to become more active leading to instability in the genome. The consequences of this hypomethylation depends on the location, such as the activation of cryptic promoters. In CpG poor promoters it can lead to oncogene activation. In repetitive elements it can lead to the activation of repeats and transposons, leading to Illegitimate recombination between repeats (the consequence of which are reciprocal translocations, deletions and insertions), to the activation of cryptic promoters and the disruption of neighbouring genes.  All of which can contribute to cancer.</p><p>Reference</p><p>Hassler MR, Egger G.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors and is approved by the FDA for use in Mylodysplastic syndrome progressed to Acute myloid leukaemia (AML). DNMT enzymes catalyse the transfer of a mythyl group to DNA. Cytosine (C) followed by Guarnine (G) DNA methylation is laid down by DNMT3a and DNMT3b in mammals and DNA methylation is maintained by DNMT1 which acts on hemimethylated DNA (were one strand is methylated and the other not). Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which irreversibly binds to DNMTs after they have become incorporated into DNA. In human cancer cells DNMT1 is responsible for both <i>de novo </i>and maintenance methylation of tumour suppressor genes.Decitabine has an anti-tumour effect because the incorporation of DNMT into DNA is replication dependent, therefore, since cancer cells are dividing much more rapidly then most normal cells they are more greatly affected. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the genome because DNA methylation is a mitotically stable genetic mark, it can be passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Therefore drugs which alter DNA methylation may be able to stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells making them susceptible to standard chemotherapy (The Economist (2012, 7th April)). A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming, the main sensitive periods during development are at primordial germ cell development and the pre-implant early post-implantation period where there is active remodelling of the epigenome. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because these are globally targeting drugs/ not specific. They effect every cell, this could result in epigenetic abnormalities, with the possibility of transgenerational effects during germ cell production. </p><p>Reference</p><p>The Economist (2012, 7th April). <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">Cancer's epicentre</a>. </p><p></p></div>
