    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands controls gene expression.  They are especially prevalent in promotor regions. CpG islands are normally hypomethylated and hence are generally active. In cancer, CpG islands are Hypermethylated and inactivated, including tumor suppressor genes resulting in unsuppressed tumor growth.  Because DNA methylation patterns are mitotically heritable the abnormal hypermethylation of the CPG islands is "remembered" hence abnormal growth and cell division has a competitive advantage in cancer cells compared with a normal cell.  In a normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the genome are hypermethylated (inactive).  In cancer there is genome wide hypomethylation of these regions, resulting in activation, including the activation of normally silent oncogenes further promoting cancer.  Also, this can result in translocations, deletions/insertions, illegitimate recombinations of genetic material and generalized genomic instability which can all potentially promote cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Imprint Control Region (ICR) of this H19/Igf2 gene cluster is differentially methylated.  The ICR of the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is normally methylated (paternally imprinted) and inactivated resulting in the inactivation via methylation of the H19 promoter gene and the long coding RNA is not made, which then allows enhancer gene products to target and upregulate gene expression of Igf2, thereby increasing growth.  The ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated, allowing an insulator protein CTCF to bind the ICR.  H19 is active allowing for down stream enhancer to preferentially target CTCF and thereby insulate Igf2, thereby restricting growth. In Wilm's tumor     the maternal ICR of H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated, the CTCF can't bind.  This results in both alleles behaving like the paternal allele for a double dose  of  Igf2.  This disruptions leads to unrestricted Igf2 growth resulting in cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a de-methylizing agent.  It act's on DNMT1, the methyltransferase that recognizes hemi-methylated chromosomes during mitosis and methylates the unmethlyated daughter strand in the same pattern as the parent strand. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which irreversibly binds to DNMT1 after incorporation into the cells DNA which then inhibits DNMT1 activity by mechanisms not yet fully understood.  By restricting DNA methylation  with a drug like decitabine you can, in a cell division dependent manner, inhibit the growth of cancer cells .  DNMT1 is essential for viability of the cell.  Inhibition of DNMT1 in cancer cell you can reduces viability.  There will be also reduced, inappropriate hyper-methylation of CPG islands, i.e., tumor suppressor genes will become more active, allowing for reduced proliferation of the tumor.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation patterns are mitotically heritable because DNMT1 recognizes and helps the daughter cells "remember" the DNA methylation pattern of the parent cell and methylates the daughter cells DNA accordingly.  This means that any alteration to DNA methylation caused by a drug will be "remembered"  when the cell divides.  Because of this, this drug and similar therapies targeting histones should be avoided during sensitive epigenetic periods of reprogramming like early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. During these sensitive periods DNA methylation and histone marks are cleared and reset, with the exception of IAP's, i.e.,repetitive elements.  Disruption of these processes with a drugs like decitabine or other classes of drugs that effect histone acetylation or de-acetlyation can result in all kinds of genomic instability: change in nuclear architecture, chromatin packaging, translocations, insertions, deletions, illegitimate recombinations, duplications, etc.  Such instability can have devastating consequences like mental retardation, cancer, deformities, fertility and even death.  <br /></div>
