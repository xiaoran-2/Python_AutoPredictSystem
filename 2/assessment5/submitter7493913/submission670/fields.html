    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal tissues the CpG islands temp to be unmethylated because in them we found many of the gene promoters including the oncogenes. This ongones transcrips a series of protein linked to the celular cell cycle that will induce the cell toward apoptosis but in cáncer the CpG islands linked to this tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated therefore silenced, making them uncapable to transcrip the required protein that causes apoptosis inducing the cell to a countinuous proliferation causing cáncer.</p><p>The CpG islands are not the only ones who suffered epigenetics abnormalities, in healthy tissues the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated causing a silencing of their gene expression; but in cáncer cells this regions are widely unmethylated and this cause a genomic instability. With a genomic instability comes a series of problems in wich the repeats start to recombinate or even worst to star a deletion. If there is a deletion of a particular CpG island that encode a tumor suppressor gene, this one is never going to express again causing cell proliferation and therefore cáncer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Igf2 is expressed only in the paternal allele, so it must be imprinted in the father so it is unmethylated in the mother. So in the mother this will cause that the CTCF complex inhibits the coding of the Igf2 but is going to transcribe the H19 gene región. If the Igf2 is imprinted in the mother y belive this will cause a lower expression of the Igf2 in comparison with the paternal imprinted gene.</p><p>In Wilm´s tumor both paternal and maternal alleles are methylated and this includes the H19, so the H19 is not going to be trasncribe and the Igf2 will be over expressed causing a major proliferation of cells and some of them may escape from apoptosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DMTi family, this drug is capable to remove methyl groups from the histones in wich they are over expressed returnig the cell to its previous epigenetic state. In cáncer cells this may help returning to a functional state the tumor suppressor genes leading cell toward apoptosis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The main problem with this drugs is that they are not preatty selective to the type of cell in wich they have to act, so if the drug targets a normal cell and starts to change the epigenetic state of it we have to remember that this ones are inherited by the daugther cells and may affect the outcome of the new cell linage. But lets think if the patient is pregnant, in this period the baby inside the woman still under devolpment and if the drug pass trough the placenta barrier and reaches the baby is going to alter the epigenetic state of the embryonic stem cells setting represive marks where it does not need tham and removing the ones it needs.</p></div>
