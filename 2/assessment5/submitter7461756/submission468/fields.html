    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In a normal cell there is hypomethylated CpG. so, we don't see methylation at CpG but DNA is methylated at repetitive elements and Intergenic regions even in introns of gene. DNA methylation is laid down by DNMT3a and DNMT3b in mammals. DNA methylation at CpG island is associated with silencing of repeats to prevent transposition. to prevent mutaion of repeats. Silencing of repeats so as to avoid transcriptional Interference from strong promotor. Methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination.DNA methylation progresses with time and ageing.As time passes CpG island becomes densly methylated. In a life time everyone suffer from some form of cancer. And some time it is not identified.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Genome imprinting results in parent of Origin dependent gene expression is mainly achieved by DNA methylation. Igf2 &amp; H19 belongs to same cluster of Imprinting gene and regulated by ICRs,DMR2 and H19 Promotor element. We have imprinting control regioin in both maternal and paternal chromosome.It shows monoallelic expression.That is expression occurs in parent of origin specific manner. If methylation occurs in paternal ICRs.the enhancer will bind to Igf2 and Igf2 will be expressed.This will cause heterochromatin spreading or DNA methylation in other part of genome.And simultaneously in Maternal chromosome CTCF (insulator protein) will bind to unmethylated ICRs which results in binding of Enhancer to H19 resulting in the expression of H19 but not Igf2 .In Wilm's syndrome is associated with Kidney tumer.In this case there is loss of cdkn1c (tumor Suppressor) and over dose of Igf2 (Oncogene,growth promotor).</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabline is an antineoplastic chemotherapy drug. Decitabline is classified as an antimetabolic and a demethylation agent.Methylation of DNA ia a major mechanism that regulate gene expression. Increased methylation results into blockage of gene expression of suppressor gene that reglate cell division. When suppressor gene are blocked cell division goes unregulated allowing cancer.Decitabine works by demethylation of DNA by this process demethylation normal function to the tumor suppressor gene is restored thus restoring control cell growth. When cell incorporates this drug into cellular metabolism. They interact with number of targets within the cell to produce direct cytotoxic effect that cause death of rapidly dividing cell.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Germ cell development is a critical period during which epigenetic patterns are established and maintained through out the life. In normal cell there is less methylation as compare to diseased tissue like colorectal cancer. Methylated genes are typically turned off, loss of methylation can cause abnormally high gene expression by altering the arrangement of chromatin. On the other hand too much methylation can undo the work of protective tumor suppressor gene.The CpG island are </div><div>heavely methylated in cancer cell thereby causing that gene that should not be silenced to turn off. This abnormality is trademark epigenetic change that occurs in tumor and happens early in development of cancer.All drugs that are used for the cancer treatment are nucleotide analog. They incorporate themself into DNA upon replication and are transferred to daughter cells through DNMT binding and DNMT binding is irreversible so treatment in case of sensitive period is not advisable.</div></div>
