    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation occurs when a methyl group is added to cytosine or guanine nucleotides. This methylation helps to control gene expressiion by regulating transcription and is essential for normal development. In normal DNA the CpG Islands and CpG shores are  unmethylated. In cancer, the CpG Islands can become hypermethylated. This hypermethylation can contribute to cancer by silencing tumour suppressor genes that normally prevent cancer by controlling cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair.<br />In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, methylation is commonly expected to be present in normal DNA. In cancer, these areas can become hypomethylated.  Genome-wide hypomethylation is common in all types of cancer. Hypomethylation leads to genomic instability, with insertions, deletions and trans locations within the DNA.<br />Hypomethylation can also occur in CpG poor promoters, which can lead to to activation of oncogenes, resulting in cancers such as gastric cancer.  Hypomethylation of imprinting regions results in increased expression of growth genes, and therefore cancers.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Paternal allele has methylation on the imprint control region, whereas maternal allele is unethylated. Igf2 is silenced in the maternal allele - not expressed. On paternal allele, enhancer scan act on Igf2 , to cause it to be expressed. With hypermethylation of ICR on the maternal allele, the Igf2 is expressed, making a double dose of Igf2. Since Igf2 is growth-promoting, tumour forms - Wilms tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug that that is a cytosine analogue.it is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferase  after they are incorporated into DNA , causing hypomethylation of the DNA.. This has an anti-tumour effect, as hypermethylation in the CpG Islands in DNA can silence tumour suppressor genes and therefore allow tumours to grow.  Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase, resulting in less methylation at these critical sites, so therefore the tumour suppressor genes can be expressed.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, and so therefore is passed on to subsequent cell generations. In this way, a change in DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the genome.<br />Although DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark, there are sensitive periods when reprogramming and removal of the methylation marks occurs - during gametogenesis and immediately after fertilisation.<br />it would be Inadvisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods as this can disrupt the normal methylation patterns on the DNA.<br /><br /></div>
