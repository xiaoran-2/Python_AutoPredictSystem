    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation are a specific epigenetics modifications, that are important in a cell because maintain genomic integrity, and is essential for viability. DNA methylation contribution to cancer can occurs in two ways: Hypomethylation genome wide; and, Tumour suppressor hypermethylation. Normally the CpG islands are hypomethylated, this mean, these islands are not methylated through the genome, in general. In cancer cell, there are more probabilities that CpG islands appears methylated. And the problem is because we found CpG islands in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, and when these islands are methylated, the genes are silenced, one mistake that can, together with others genome changes (like activation of oncogenes), produces cancer. In fact, this epimutation is so efective to produces cell proliferation due to one particular characteristic: is mitotically heritable.<br />The opposite take place with intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which are methylated through the genome in a normal cell. The unmethylation or hypomethylation of these regions, more frequently in repetitive elements, can produces genomic instability which may produces cancer. The methylation of repeats and intergenic regions protect the genome from transposable elements, reciprocal 
translocations, insertions, deletions, transciptional interference, etc. The hypomethylation can produce, for example, that a repetitive element makes a copy of himself and jump around the genome, disrupting genes and activating neighborhoods genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations in DNA methylation at Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs), result in the loss of imprinting expression of some genes, which participate in processes of growth, and consequently, can be the cause of the formation of tumors. <br />There are many gene clusters that are imprinted. One of them, the H19Igf2 cluster, is a good reference. <br />We have two copies or alleles of the gene, one paternal allele, and one maternal allele. In a normal cell, the paternal allele have the ICR and the H19 gene methylated, allowing the enhancers to act on the Igf2 gene, which in consequence is expressed, The opposite occurs in the maternal allele: the ICR and the H19 gene are unmethylated, allowing a protein (epigenetic factor), named CTCF, to bind to the ICR, insulating the Igf2 gene, and now, the enhancers can only act on the H19 gene. In consequence, in the maternal allele, the Igf2 is silenced.<br />Now, this pattern is disrupted in Wilm´s tumour, where the maternal allele acts like the paternal one, this is, the Igf2 gene is expressed, because the methylation of the maternal ICR and H19, resulting in the overexpression of Igf2, a promoter of growth.   <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>

    <div class="field-value">Myelodisplastic syndromes are a group of bone marrow stem cells disorders where the person loss his ability to produce normal red and white blood cells, and, platelets (1). It seems that a hypermethylation of suppressor genes (regulate cell growth and division) are the cause of these syndromes (3). One of the drug therapy used to treat these syndromes are epigenetic drugs. One of them, decitabine, is a DNA demethylating agent, that is, interfere the methylation of DNA (2). By doing that, it restore the function of suppressor genes, restoring the control over cell growth. This is one of the anticancer effects of decitabine. Other effect is that it has a cytotoxic effect, killing the rapidly dividing cells (3).<br /><br /><br /><br />(1).

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

    <div class="field-value">The drugs that are used to treat some cancers are DNA demethylating agents, which alter the process of methylation of DNA. This is a classic epigenetic modification that is passed on during cell division to daughters and so on: it´s mitotically heritable. This feature allows the tumour cell treated with a drug to maintain the effect during cell division, and so, the progeny stop the unregulated growth and division. <br />Nevertheless there are sensitive periods when treating patients with this drugs should be avoid. The sensitive periods refer to windows in the development where epigenetics modifications to control expression genes are cleared (for the case of DNA methylation and imprinted genes) and reseted, or, maintenance of the repetitive elements. This process is named epigenetic reprogramming, and occurs in germ cell development and early embrionic development. Is essential for viability, and for example, if the epigenetics drugs are used in pregnant women, they may produce letal interferences in the process of epigenetic reprogramming, and the embryo can die before implantation. <br /></div>
