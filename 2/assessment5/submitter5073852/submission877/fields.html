    <div class="field-value">Different genomic regions have different DNA methylation patterns. CpG Islands (CpGI) are associated to gene promoters, normally their are no methylated, so the genes are actives. These genes are mostly tumour supressor  when they are actives. When methylation occurs at CpGI there is a  transcription silencing (inactivation of genes). At These CpGI methylation is increasing when abnormal cancerous cells are appearing. Hypermethylation appears in CpGI in cancerous processes, causing silencing of genes associated to these regions, e.g. some tumor supressor genes are inactivated or silenced.<br />Intergenic repetitve regions are normally highly methylated, so in normal cellsmethylation is acting as repressor of genes. These regions are hypometylated in cancer processes increasing instability and cancerous procesesses are favoured.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In H19/Igf2 cluster there is a loss of imprinting in cancerous preocess. <br />In paternal allele the Imprint Control Region (ICR) block is methylated, so Igf2 is active,  CTF is inactive and H19 is silent (inactive too). That is caused by methylation of H19.<br />In maternal allele, is just the opposite, CTF is active and H19 is active too,  and enhancers don't have acces to Igf2, so Igf2 is inactive.<br />In tumoural cells, both paternal and maternal DNA have H19 hypermethylated, that produces an ianctivation of imprinting, In these cases both (maternal and paternal ) so IGf2 are active. It is produced an overexpression of Insuline-like growth factor II. This fact is associated with serious carcinomas.<br />.<i></i></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a histone-deacetylase inhibitor who when is combined with azacitidine (a chemical analogue to citidine) is really efficient in miellodysplastic syndromes . It is  the first epigenetic drug penetrating  solid tumors. Solid tomors have  difficult treatment because the drugs has to penetrate them. These drug (decitabine) apparently decreases dramatically the overmethylation in these tumoral cells. These epigenetic changes are inherited to daughter cells and so on to progeny until methylation is erased completely. This is a form of supression of  a cancer growing without kill any cell, it is a non invasive therapy.<br /> Decitabine acts too altering tumor cells in a way that they are more susceptible to chemotherapy, so in general, patients treated with this combination of drugs have a very good response.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">If a cell reduces dramatically the overmethylation, when this cell is divided in mitosis, the dauhgter cells have an DNA no overmethylated. If this methylation reduction continue in time, in each generatoio of cells less methylation appears. After several generations, cells overmethylated are disapeared and only normal cells exist .  Overmethylation do not appear in future generations of these cells, tha is, this no methylation is inherited andno appears de novo.<br />Sensitive periods of development are this fases in early development which epigenetic reprogramming is more important. Dutch famine in gestant women and developping child is an exemple of sensitive period. In these periods, treatment of hyper or hyponutrition can be very dangerous for the foetus/baby/child in his posterior development.</div>
