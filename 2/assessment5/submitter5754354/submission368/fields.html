    <div class="field-value"><div>CGIs are most often found in or close to gene promoters. In normal cells they are usually kept free of DNA methylation regardless of the associated gene's activity. In contrast, cancer cells often show DNA hypermethylation at specific CGI loci compared to normal cells. Methylation of CGIs and CpG island shores (2kb surrounding CGIs themselves) silences  gene expression. Particular loci in cancer cells that are hypermethylated include CGIs of tumour suppressor genes (such as RB, MLH1, BRCA1 and others) which are consequently silenced. The lack of expression of a gene-product involved in tumor suppression in turn contributes to proliferation and tumorigenesis since the mechanisms to prevent this happening are impaired within the cell.</div><div><br /></div><div>Normally intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated, leading to inactivation with the presence of heterochromatin and a lack of transcription. This apparently functions to maintain genome stability and integrity by, for example, preventing unwanted transcription and transposition of repetitive elements and reducing the likelihood of illegitimate recombination events between distant repetitive regions such as reciprocal translocations, deletions and insertions. In cancerous cells there is genome-wide hypomethylation of these regions, with their consequent activation. The result is aberrant transcription and genome instability (activation of repetitive elements, aberrant DNA repair,  illegitimate recombination, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of surrounding genes) associated with tumorigenesis. </div><div><br /></div><div><span>Both of these phenomena relate to severe deregulation of gene expression, a hallmark of cancer.</span></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The methylation pattern of the imprinting control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster determines Igf2 expression status. <br />The paternally derived H19/Igf2 ICR is methylated which results in enhancement of Igf2 expression, on the otherhand the maternally derived H19/Igf2 ICR is unmethylated resulting in repression of Igf2 expression.The consequence of this in normal cells is monoallelic expression of Igf2, i.e. only the paternal allele is expressed.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour the normal imprinting pattern is disrupted by methylation of both maternal and paternal ICRs with the result that both chromosomes have enhanced expression of Igf2. <br /><br />Igf2 is a growth factor promoting cell division so the more it is expressed the more cells proliferate. By disrupting imprinting (i.e. monoallelic expression) of Igf2 so that it is expressed on both parental chromosomes levels of it are upregulated and cell proliferation enhanced, contributing to cancer.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><div>Decitabine is a DNA methyl-transferase inhibitor or DNMTi. It is a cytidine analogue which becomes incorporated into the chromosome in place of deoxycytidine during DNA replication. The DNMT substrate is deoxycytidine to which it transfers a methyl group, however if deoxycytidine is replaced with a decitabine residue DNMTs bind irreversibly to it and no methyl group is transferred. The result is inhibition of inheritance of CpG methylation. </div><div><br /></div><div>Cancer cells are rapidly dividing so decitabine will be incorporated into cells' chromosomes during DNA replication and daughter DNA will thus be demethylated compared to the parent DNA. Furthermore since many cancers silence tumour suppresor genes by hypermethylation of associated CpG islands decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by reducing methylation at these hypermethylated CGIs and hence allow for the expression of tumour suppressing gene products. </div></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Since epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are mitotically heritable an alteration of the DNA methylation states may persist within the lifetime of a cell and be transmitted to its descendants, hence there can be enduring effects on the epigenome of a cell-line and organism. Within development there are periods in which groups of cells are particularly vulnerable to epigenetic disruption caused by environmental insults, these are defined as "sensitive periods". The vulnerability is due to the occurrence during these periods of epigenetic reprogramming where many epigenetic marks are erased and established. Two such periods are during the early embryo and primordial germ cell development. </div><div><br /></div><div>Treating patients during a sensitive period such as during primordial germ cell development with an epigenome altering drug would interfere with the normal processes of epigenetic reprogramming with the consequence that germ cells could have abnormal epigenomic patterns and the potential for offspring to have an epigenetic disease. Likewise treatment during other sensitive periods may have a potentially damaging effect on an organism. Hence it is inadvisable without further study to treat patients during this period.</div><div><br /></div></div>
