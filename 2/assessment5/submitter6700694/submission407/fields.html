    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">DNA is normally hypomethlated at CpG islands but in cancer is hypermethylated. DNA methylation if CpG islands is disrupted whenever parts of the epigenetic machinery become mutated. Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer in a varity of ways but a very common way is by<span> silencing tumor supressor genes. DNA methylation in intergenic regions/repetive elements is used to maintain genetic integreity by silencing the genes. DNA methylation is disrupted in these regions when hypomethylation occurs. This contributes to cancer because it allows illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promotors and neighboring genes. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Cancer cells will often display loss of imprinting. Methylation patter of the paternal allele = methylated so enhancers act on Igf2. <span> Methylation patter of the maternal allele = unmethylated so enhancers act on H19 and Igf2 is silenced. In Wilm's tumor, there is hypermethylation and both alleles act like the paternal so no H19 is expressed. Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer because it is involved in growth (in the case of Wilm's tumor, it is growth promoting). </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">By restoring DNA methylation, it may be possible to restore the normal function; that is to say the tumor suppressor genes stay active and the oncogenes remain inactive.  The sensitive period is when we must consider context and the stage of the disease before using epigenetics to diagnose/prognoses/treat. Sensitive  periods of development = gestation and germ cell development. It is inadvisable because genes functions/epigenetic functions differ in time and space during these periods. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNMTi epigenetic inhibitor class. Decitabine targets an enzyme to inhibit DNA methyltransferase and thus it has an anti-tumour effect because it helps to combat hypermethylation.   </div>
