    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation functions at CpG islands and CpG island shores as tumour suppressor genes. Disruption of DNA methylation exhibits locus specific DNA hypermethylation or genome-wide DNA hypomethylation in cancer. Loss of imprinting thus leads to cancer.<br /><br />DNA methylation occurs at CpG islands usually unmethylated, while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. Hypomethylation and disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements results in genomic transposition and instability, and oncogene activation. D<span>isruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which altered to hypermethylation and hypomethylation, can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, and overexpression of growth promoting genes.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 is expressed in the methylation of the paternal and maternal allele. Epigenetic disruption for loss of imprinting results in overdose and overexpression of H19/Igf2 clusters and causes Wilm's tumour and cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, in the form of  DNA-demethylating agents, <span>are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.<br /><br /></span><span>Decitabine slowed tumour growth in some people. It is the drug that has been deployed successfully against a solid tumour, rather than a leukaemia or a lymphoma. </span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, since <span>epigenetic changes have been passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.<br /><br />A sensitive period when exposed and altered environments (temperature, diet, maternal care, chemical exposure...)  has an effect on epigenetic inheritance. </span></div>
