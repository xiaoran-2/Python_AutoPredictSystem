    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is one of the most
effective epigenetic mechanisms for regulating gene expression. At genome level,
DNA methylation can be found mainly in intergenic regions and repetitive
elements, so that they remain silenced  and
genomic instability is avoided.</span></p>

<p>Other site of action of DNA
methylation are CpG islands. CpG islands are mainly located in the promoter region
of genes. Normally CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation since if
they got methylated, the gene will be silenced.</p>

<p>However, in cancer there’s a genome-wide
hypomethylation plus a hypermethylation of CpG islands. The consequences of DNA
hypomethylation are mainly activation or expression of intergenic regions and
repetitive elements, promoting this way genetic instability: illegitimate
recombination, activation of cryptic promoters, gene disruption, etc.</p>

<p><span>Hypermethylation of CpG islands
leads to gene silencing. In cáncer, the affected genes are usually tumor-supressor
genes. In this context, proliferation, gain of genetic mutations and cell overgrowth are promoted because of oncogen expression, tumor-supressor gene silencing and genomic instability, resulting in cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting disruption affects expression
of the genes within the cluster. It is well known that many imprinted genes are
involved in growth, so imprinting loss might lead to tumour formation and cancer.</p>

<p>This is how in the case of Beckwith
Wiedemann Syndrome, there’s an overexpression of igf2 oncogen, which leads to
alterations such as fetal and postnatal overgrowth, macroglosia and tumour
predisposition as Wilm tumour (kidney). </p>

<p>Normally at H19/Igf2 cluster, the
patern allele is methylated at the imprinting control región (ICR) and the maternal
allele’s ICR remains unmethylated. When the ICR is unmethylated, CTCF -who acts
as an insulator protein- binds to ICR and blocks Igf2 enhancement by downstream
enhancers, leading to the expression of H19 instead of Igf2.</p>

<p>In the case of the paternal allele,
the ICR is methylated and CTCF binding is avoided, leading to methylation of
H19 (by DNA methylation spreading) and enhancement by downstream enhancers and
subsequent expression of Igf2.</p>

<p><span>This "balance" is impaired in Beckwith
Wiedemann Syndrome, previously mentioned, in which maternal allele behaves like
paternal allele, producing an overexpression of Igf2 oncogen and thus leading to
tumour formation and cancer predisposition.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug used for
myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia treatment. Decitabine has
been approved by FDA and belongs to DNA methyltranferase inhibitors (DNMTi).
Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue (cytidine analog) and hypomethylates DNA by
irreversible binding of DNMT after being incorporated into DNA sequence
(replication dependent).</p>

<p><span>Decitabine’s therapeutic effect
lies in CpG islands hypomethylation, which are hypermethylated in cancer context.
After mitosis, DNA starts to demethylate passively by dilution because of
Decitabine binding of DNMTs. This way, many CpG islands located in promoters
that were methylated, demethylates with a subsequent activation of genes such
as tumor supresor genes, allowing them to oppose to cancer progression.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As an epigenetic mark, DNA
methylation is mitotically heritable. Drugs which alter DNA methylation do so
through hypomethylation of hypermethylated regions of cancer cells (CpG
islands). These epigenetic changes are passed on to daughter and granddaughter
cell and finally once the epigenetic mark (methylation) disappears, never
return. This changes are stable and explains why these drugs can have effects
that last beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>

<p>However, these kind of drugs are
not specific and alter DNA methylation in both tumour cells and healthy cells.
In elderly patients who go through cancer this isn’t a problem because the
purpose of therapy is just expanding lifespan and improving life quality.</p>

<p>The risk is when young people
goes through therapy and is exposed to side effects of drugs in other tissues
which are under sensitive periods with active epigenetic resseting. The
sensitive periods occur in spermatogenesis and oogenesis in puberty, and could
be even worse if a pregant women takes the drug (preimplantation period and
germ cell develpment are sensitive periods).</p>

<p>Damage in germ cells could lead
to epigenome disruptions and impact on both individual and it’s offspring.</p></div>
