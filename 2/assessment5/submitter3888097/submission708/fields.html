    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG island repress gene expression, unmethylated CpG island are associated with active transcription. <br />Locus specific DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands can occur in cancer, thus DNA methylation can silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer. <br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated, and this contributes to maintaining genomic stability and silencing of repeats to prevent transposition. <br />Cancer is associated with genome-wide hypomethylation and progresses with tumorigenicity. The consequence of hypomethylation depends on location, but can lead to genomic instability resulting in recombination between repeats, activation of transposition and activation of cryptic promotors and disruption of genes.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal ICR is methylated and block binding of CTCF. DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence the gene and and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate gene expression in the paternal allele. In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and can bind CTCF. H19 promotor is not methylated and the gene gets transcribed. The CTCF binding blocks enhancers from reaching and Igf2 and the gene is not transcribed. <br />In Wilms tumor the ICR is hypermethylated, and both the paternal and maternal Igf2 is expressed. Increased Igf2 cause increased cell growth and cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company is a DNA-demethylating agents, and, are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase and is a chemical analogue of cytidine. Removal of the DNA methylation may weaken the effects of gene silencing mechanisms that occurred in cancer. Demethylation may reduce the stability of silencing signals and thus confer relative gene activation<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes, which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. <br />Sensitive periods are during early development, and specifically during primordial germ cell development and shortly after fertilization before the epioblast stage. During epigenetig programming in these periods treatment would not be advised since it can potentially affect the reprogramming and thus the global epigenetic pattern. Also the neonatal period may be a sensitive period. Epigenetic drugs might cause large epigenetic changes also in healthy cells during these periods. <br /><br /></div>
