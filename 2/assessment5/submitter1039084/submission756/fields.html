    <div class="field-value">When cancer is present, epigenetic differences in DNA methylation of the genome are observed. In a normal cell, the typical condition of most CpG islands is unmethylated allowing the promoter to activate gene expression. In a cell with cancer, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated at the promoter region of the tumor suppressor gene, disrupting its function by inhibiting gene expression (gene examples: RB, MLH1, BRCA1). When the tumor suppressor gene is not expressed because of the hypermethylated CpG islands in the promoter region, the cells are less effective at inhibiting cancer progression. While CpG islands at the promoter region are typically unmethylated in a normal cell, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements contain methylated sites that inhibit function and prevent genomic instability. This methylation in the intergenic regions may contribute to genomic stability by silencing the cryptic promoters or cryptic splice sites found in the intergenic regions. The normally methylated repetitive element regions maintains genomic integrity and prevents mutagenic transposition by silencing the repeats, preventing transcriptional interference from strong promoters in these regions and may also prevent illegitimate recombination. When the normal DNA methylation patterns are disrupted with hypomethylation in these regions, the genomic integrity is compromised and the cell may experience divergent gene expression, transcriptional interference, mutation by transposition, and transcriptional interference which can all contribute to cancer by over expressing oncogenes and lack of or under expression of tumor suppressor genes. Global DNA methylation decreases in a cell as cancer develops and progresses while methylation at CpGI’s, specifically tumor suppressor promoter regions becomes denser.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting in the H19/Igf2 gene cluster leads to fetal and postnatal overgrowth causing embryonic and childhood tumor growth. The normal methylation pattern of paternal alleles of the H19/Igf2 gene cluster present with methylated imprint control regions (ICR). The CTCF insulator protein cannot bind the methylated ICR and the downstream enhancers increase Igf2 gene expression on the paternal chromosome. On the maternal H19/Igf2 gene cluster, the ICR is not methylated and is therefore bound by the CTCF insulator protein, insulating the maternal Igf2 gene from the downstream enhancers, inhibiting expression of the maternal Igf2 gene. In Beckwith Widemann syndrome, a Wilm’s tumor of the kidney originates from fetal/postnatal overgrowth caused by an overdose of paternal gene expression patterns in this gene cluster and can be exacerbated by issues with both the H19/Igf2 gene cluster and the Kcnq1 cluster. The paternal Igf2 gene dose is upregulated through either the maternal allele behaving like a paternal allele due to a mutation/deletion, uniparental paternal disomy, or by epigenetic disruption of imprinting. Overgrowth through overexpression of the oncogene Igf2 and the additional loss of the maternal Cdkn1c tumor suppressor gene function leads to the Wilm’s tumor development.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an epigenetic enzymatic regulator, a DNA-demethylating class agent sold to treat cancer under the name Dacogen. The decitabine is used to treat the myelodysplastic syndromes that are precursors of acute myeloid leukemia. Decitabine impacts DNA methylation by irreversibly binding to DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and inhibiting its DNA methylation function. Decitabine can inhibit DNA methylation typically imposed by DNMT1 at the CpG islands at the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes. This would prevent the cancerous cell from shutting off the expression of the tumor suppressor genes, thereby resulting in an anti-tumor effect that would otherwise be inhibited. This mechanism, in cancers that are activated more by the repression of the tumor suppressor genes, would be slowed down, ideally mitigated, and perhaps treated in additional ways such as chemotherapy more effectively.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic drugs that altered the tumor cells and made them more susceptible to chemotherapy could be a result of the epigenegic changes that are heritable and passed on during cell division. Because the tumor cells are dividing faster than normal cells, the treatment affects the tumor cells to a greater degree and in many cases slows down the tumor growth. The chemotherapy is likely more effective on the treated tumors because the growth is less aggressive making the cancer cells more susceptible to the chemotherapy treatment. A sensitive period is where epigenetic reprogramming is occurring during develpment. It is highly important that this sensitive period is not disrupted for continuity of the epigenetic marks. The sensitive time period is when the primordial germ cell development begins through the production of mature germ cells and during the preimplantation period and early postimplantation periods due to the active remodeling taking place in the epigenome and is most vulnerable to insults from the environment during these times. It would be inadvisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during the sensitive period because of the epigenomic imprinting that occurs helps maintain genomic stability, interference with imprinting can lead to additional cancers.</div>
