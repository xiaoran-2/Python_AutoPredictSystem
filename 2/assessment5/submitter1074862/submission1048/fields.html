    <h1>Submission 1048 from Anon (session_user_id: eab3e3674a9c490da6d0528ea015a050e8b96845)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent.  It works by removing the methyl groups from tumor supressor genes - the methyl groups having silenced these genes, thereby allowing tumors to form.  The methlyation is on the histones in the area of the genes themselves, causing the DNA in this region to be more compacted and not able to be expressed.  By removing this methlation, the gene is able to be expressed and the tumor supression activity is able to take place.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the embryonic period of a mammal, there are periods where epigenetic marks are laid down or removed, and these are the sensitive periods.  Soon after fertilization, methlation is removed, and then laid down again, and in the formation of the early germ cells, methlytion is removed and then a little later on, restored.  This methlyation is important in the maintenance of certain cell lines in the differentiation which occurs in embryonic development.<br /><br /> If these demethylation drugs are used in this period, this laying down of the methyl groups would be interrupted.  I would guess that the embryo would not be able to institute cellular differentiation and of course, this would certainly lead to fetal demise.   Also, for animals such as us, with x inactivation in females - use of this type of drug might interfere with the inactivation, resulting in an overdose of whatever genes are on the X chromosome.<br /><br /> If methlyation is removed, it does not come back, so of course, one would not want to use anti methlyation drugs during this period.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands correlate positively with gene promoters, and are un-methylated regardless of the activity of the promoter.  Often, in cancer states, these CpG islands are over methylated which causes silencing of the promoter and therefore the gene it promotes.  If the gene in question is a tumor supressor gene, then it will not be able to act to supress tumors and cancer might be the result.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">I haven't had the chance to watch the videos for this week, I was only able to read the papers, and I don't think that this information was in the readings.  Sorry.</div>
