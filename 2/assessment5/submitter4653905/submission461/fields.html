    <div class="field-value"><span>In <b>normal cells</b> <b>most CpG islands</b> are hypomethylated allowing the expression of related genes, whereas when CGI's are methylated, they are involved with silencing of genes by condensing  the
chromatin with methylated CpG binding proteins (MecP1/2)  which bind the methylated
dinucleotides, block transcription factors, repress transcription
of genes occluding their expression.  This is mainly seen at x chromosome inactivation.  <br /><br />However, <b>in cancer </b>the opposite occurs<b>-promoter CpG islands</b> are noticeably hypermethylated causing the related genes to become silenced while instead, the genome becomes hypomethylated leading to genomic instability.<br />CGI's methylation differs with tumour type but epigenetic silencing of tumour-suppressing genes, the hypermethylation of CGI's increasing over time and the global hypomethylation decreasing over time is a feature of them all. For tumourigenesis to occur more than one tumour-suppressing gene would have to be suppressed.  DNA hypermethylation of CGI's are mitotically heritable and rapidly proliferate but unlike mutations they are reversible which gives hope for treatment. <br /><br />The disruption of the methylation of CpG Islands is one of the contributing factors for tumourigenesis to occur, along other features like the development of oncogenes for instance.  The function of methylation within the genomic structure is to preserve stability of the system.  So if CpG islands become hypermethylated instead of being hypomethylated, and the remainder of the genome hypomethylated when it's usually heterochromatized and impervious to transcription factors, there can be interruptions to the transcription factors, loss or gaining of chromosomes, incorrect recombinations between chromosomes, recombinations between repeats in the intergenic regions and reciprocal translocations between chromosomes.<br /><br />So methylation change permits evasion of growth suppression, indefinite proliferation and active invasion of other tissue, resistance of cell death and
ability to draw more blood vessels to itself for nutrients.  Additionally methylation change also causes, inflammation, genomic
instability, and of course mutations<br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Using the H19/Igf2  cluster to contrast normal &amp; abnormal expression of imprinting. </p><p>The normal methylation pattern of the paternal allele is for the ICR to be methylated which not only stops the binding of the insulator protein but also allows for the paternal imprint  of Igf2 but also blocks the action of H19 lcRNA because of heterochromatin spreading. </p><p>The maternal allele has an unmethylated ICR but it is bound by CTCF which insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers thereby blocking the expression of Igf2 - this action is probably because of chromatin looping. But downstream enhancers can act on H19 instead. So Igf2 is only expressed on the paternal allele not the maternal allele.</p><p>But if there is an imprint disorder and the maternal ICR is also hypermethylated as well as the paternal ICR (becoming in effect 2 paternal alleles), then CTCF does not bind to the ICR inhibiting it, and the enhancers are able to act on the maternal Igf2 and the paternal Igf2 as is usual, resulting in an overexpression of the Igf2 growth enhancer (oncogene) - dosing from both paternal and maternal instead of only the paternal allele,leading to Wilms tumour.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (Dacogen 5-aza-2′-deoxyazacitidine
) is a DNA demethylating agent - a hypomethylating agent, which is a nucleoside analogue and which is used to treat AML.  <br /><br />It appears to be successful in AML because it's possible that it may be dependent on CpG Islands. <br />When replication takes place, Decitabine is absorbed into the DNA and when DNMT1 methyltransferase attempts to bind and copy the methylation to the daughter cells, it is bound completely and the methylation is blocked from release. <br /><br />However, the process is dependent on there being a cell replication but as tumour cells replicate more rapidly than normal cells this speeds the hypomethylation process.<br /><br />As the methylation is blocked on replication of the cells, the CpG's return to their hypomethylated state and the tumour-suppressor genes silencing unblocked and become expressed again.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">If the DNA hypermethylation at CpG Islands can be hypomethylated and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the genome hypermethylated again it would stabilise the epigenome &amp; reverse the silencing of the tumour-suppressor genes. Epigenetic marks are reversible and are mitotically heritable lasting indefinitely so once the changes in switching are made, the marks are passed on to daughter &amp; grandaughter cells .  <br /><br />However changes to epigenetic marks would not be made in sensitive periods in the development of the embryo.  Sensitive periods are developmental times when active remodelling of the epigenetic marks are occuring.  These sensitive times include primordial germ cell maturation in mid-gestation, the pre-implantation period - a time for imprinting and clearance , <br /><br />So it would be inadvisable to change epigenetic marks during these sensitive periods due to the likelihood of negative epigenetic effects for instance in erronious transcription factors or incorrect recombinations which would lead to genomic instability.<br /></div>
