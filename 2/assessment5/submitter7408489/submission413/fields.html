    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>CpG islands and shores of the normal cells tend to remain hypomethylated. The hypomethylated state allows for transcription factors to access DNA and allows for gene transcription to occur. While in cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated, leading to 'turning off' of the tumour suppressor genes, allowing rapid cell proloferation.<br /></li><li>However, at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, the reverse seems to occur. The cancer cells seem to be exhibit hypomethylation at these regions, while the normal cells exhibit hypermethylation. Hypermethylation at this region prevents genomic instability. The global hypomethylation in cancer cells leads to genomic instability, consequently, further chromosomal abberations like deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.</li><li>Although it is believed that this hypomethylation impacts chromosomal instability, the extent of repetitive sequence hypomethylation in contribution to the development and progression of human cancers is yet to be understood. </li></ul><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Most imprinted genes are involved in cell growth. Therefore disruption of these imprinted genes lead to either increased expression from both parental alleles or complete silencing from both the alleles. An example that best explains this is H19/Igf2 cluster. <br /></li><li>In normal cells, the imprint control region (ICR) of H19/IGF2 cluster, at maternal allele is unmethylated, allowing the binding of a transcriptional repressor, CTCF to ICR, allowing enhancers to act at H19 cluster and thereby not allowing IGF2 expression. </li><li>However the ICR at paternal allele is hypermethylated, which allows enhancers to act at IGF2 gene, leading to expression of IGF2. <br /></li><li>In case of cancer cells, loss of imprinting occurs and therefore ICR's at both paternal and maternal allele are hypermethylated and enhancers act at IGF2 locus leading to overexpression of IGF2, abberant cellular growth and proliferation, resulting in a cancerous condition called wilm's tumor. <br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine, is one among the first set of FDA approved drugs designed to target epigenetic machinery. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine belongs to the class DNA Methyl Transferase inhibitors (DNMTi). <br /></li><li>It is a nucleoside analogue which gets incorporated into DNA upon replication. When DNA Methyl Transferases (DNMT) bind at that specific region of DNA, to copy DNA methylation to daughter strand, these analogues irreversibly binds to DNMT and it can no longer be released and therefore they can no longer function. </li><li>The function of DNMTi is cell division dependent. Therefore cancer cells which are rapidly diving in the body are much severely affected than the normal cells, (as they are replicating at a comparatively much higher rate).</li><li>Decitabine exerts its anti-tumour effect by reactivating the tumor supressor genes which are silenced epigenetically.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altered DNA methylation patterns are a result of genome-wide loss or a regional gain of DNA methylation. The DNA methylation once manupulated, seems to have enduring effects on the epigenome, as the methyl signatures are maintained by the enzyme DNA Methyl Transferase (DNMT). It is beleived <span>that epigenetic changes may </span>endure<span> in at least four subsequent generations of organisms.</span><br />The drugs that alter DNA methylation may have a long lasting consequences and it is very important to consider this, particularly in case of Pregnant mothers and younger patients, those who are developing germ cells. This period of development, where extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs is considered as the sensitive period. The drug that functions to inhibit the epigenetic machinery could be the large environmental insult and thereby affects development to a large extent. Therefore treating patients during this sensitive period would be inadvisable.</div>
