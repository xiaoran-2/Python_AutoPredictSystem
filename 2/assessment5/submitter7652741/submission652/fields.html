    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation of CPG islands normally limits gene activity<br />DNA methylation of CpG islands may be hypermethylated. This is particularly important with tumour suppressors that if then not active limits their ability to restrict growth and may lead to cancer. Examples include hypermethylation of RB, MLH1, BRCA1 and MGMT.<br />Generally intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells. In Cancer cells the opposite tends to be true with hypomethylation of these regions. <br />This is important for example as hypomethylation of these regions can lead to increased genomic instability with hypomethylation of repeat regions (may lead to increased splicing/translocations); As well hypomethylation of CpG poor oncogenes can lead to increased growth and subsequently cancer if they lose their normal methylation. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations in imprinted regions (hypo or hypermethylation) can cause increased growth and thus cancer.<br />Normally the paternal allele is hypermethylated in the case of H19/IgF2 and the maternal is not. This shuts off expression of IgF2 from the maternal allele. In the paternal, enhancers may function and you get a normal expression pattern of IgF2 and thus growth. However, when the maternal allele ICR  is hypermethylated, this allows the downstream enhancers on the maternal allele to also stimulate IgF2. This leads to IgF2 hyper-expression from both alleles, increased growth and results in Wilm's Tumor. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue. It is a member of the DNA-demethylating epigenetic inhibitors. <br />Decitabine acts to decrease DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methytransferases.<br />In areas that are hypermethylated, for example CpG islands, by removing these methyl groups, the hope is that you allow increased expression of crucial genes that will allow regulation of growth. For example, if certain tumour suppressors promoters are hypermethylated, this won't allow their expression and may lead to increased growth and cancer. By removing the methyl groups, normal expression levels will hopefully be attained and the growth process shut off or minimised. This is the basis for future CIMP+ tumour classes that have very few genetic changes but clear epigenetic disruption. Recent research on ependymoma shows these tumours due worse and are not sensitive to traditional chemotherapy. Using agents like this are proposed for the next clinical trials. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">All cells in our body are under control of epigenetics. By using systemic agents that alter DNA methylation there is the possibility that normal controls are disrupted. In cancer cells, we know this to be the case but the concern is that critical normal controls would be changed in cells required for normal growth and development, particularly sensitive periods for this. This might include in critical periods such as fertilisation and implantation of an embryo or in the further maturation of embryonic stem cells to the differentiated final forms. Periods of sensitivity would include those where epigenetic changes are being erased or laid down, including germ cell development and embryonic development. Methylation changes occur in these sensitive periods and are mitotically heritable. Thus, if you remove these marks it is likely that daughter cells and their epigenetic changes may have changed controllers that otherwise would have been remained. This is why drugs like this in pregnancy or in those sexually active are closely regulated to insure not given during at risk periods. </div>
