    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a mechanism that controls the expression of genes. DNA methylation at the CpG islands regulates the activity of genes like tumor suppressor genes. As a general rule, in cancer, there is a decrease in methylation throughout the whole genome. This decrease in methylation is mostly evident in the repetitive elements and in the intergenic regions of the genome. However there are some areas in the genome that show an increase in methylation in cancer and these are the CpG islands. The increase in methylation in the CpG islands inhibits the activity of tumour suppressor genes and results in an increase in cancers. DNA methylation in the intergenic regions and in the repetitive elements are responsible for decreasing the activity of genes like the oncogenes. Decrease in methylation in the repetitive elements and in the intergenic areas leads to an increase in activity of oncogenes and results in an increase in cancers. <strong>In conclusion, changes in DNA methylation in the genome can lead to cancers in two ways</strong>: increased expression of oncogenes through reduced methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements or decreased expression of tumour suppressor genes because of increased methylation in the CpG islands. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The term imprinting refers to the mechanisms whereby the expression of genes belonging to one parent is affected. Imprinting is the mechanism for parent - of - origin specific inheritance. <strong>Loss of methylation in the DNA of the imprint control region is a common feature of cancers</strong>. In the case of the genes referred to as the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is not methylated while the maternal allele is methylated. This means that the maternal allele is imprinted while the paternal allele is not. Imprinting of the maternal allele in the H19/Igf2 cluster results in changes that prevent enhancers from expressing Igf2 (an oncogene) while promoting the expression of the gene Kcnq1ot1 (a tumour suppressor gene). Loss of methylation in the H19/Igf2 cluster in the maternal allele results in a disruption of imprinting and allows the maternal allele to behave like the paternal allele by expressing the Igf2 gene and suppressing the Kcnq1ot1 gene. This loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster in the maternal allele results in cancers like Wilm's tumour because of unrestricted activity of the oncogene Igf2 by both alleles. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug that belongs to the class of drugs called <strong>DNA demethylating agents</strong>. Decitabine is therefore a drug that will decrease the amount of methylation in certain parts of the genome. We know that increased methylation in the CpG islands is a feature of cancer cells and that such increased methylation in CpG islands cause decreased activity of tumour suppressor genes. Drugs like Decitabine are probably effective by reducing the excess methylation in the CpG islands and restoring the potency of the tumour suppressor genes. Decitabine is a drug that has an anticancer effect by acting at the epigenetic level, not at the genetic level. This drug has been used for treatment of myelodysplasia. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes can be transmitted through gametes. This is the mechanism for trans-generational transmission of epigenetic changes. Changes in DNA methylation affect the epigenome in one of two ways: either the affected gene is silenced or the affected gene is expressed.Changes in DNA methylation are most prominently seen during two sensitive periods of life. <strong>The term "sensitive period" refers to those periods which show prominent loss of DNA methylation in the genome</strong>. During these sensitive periods epigenetic marks are being reorganised. The first sensitive period is the pre-implantation period which refers to the period after fertilisation but before implantation of the fertilised egg in the placenta. The second sensitive period is the period when primordial germ cells develop in the gonads as a prelude to the formation of gametes. This occurs during the reproductive years.  Drugs that affect the epigenetic state must be used with extreme caution during these sensitive periods of life because the epigenetic changes that take place during these periods have profound effects on the individual genome and the genome of the progeny.    </div>
