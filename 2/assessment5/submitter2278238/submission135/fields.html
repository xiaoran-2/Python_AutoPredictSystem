    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands often occur at promoters of tumour suppressor
genes. Tumour suppressor genes code for proteins which trigger cell death and
thus control aberrant tumour growth. Usually, CpG islands are unmethylated. In
cancer cells however, they are often aberrantly methylated. This leads to silencing
of the tumour suppressor genes by preventing the transcription machinery from
binding. With a resulting lack of tumour suppressor proteins, the cancerous cells
escape cell death and grow in an uncontrolled manner. </p>

<p>In a normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive
elements are usually methylated and thus silenced. The purpose of these
methylations is to maintain genomic integrity by preventing transposition and
by counteracting strong promoters. The methylation in repetitive elements may
also protect against recombination. In Cancer, this is inversed, and
genome-wide hypomethylation is often found, including in intergenic regions and
repetitive elements, thus removing these protective features.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster works by enhancer blocking. In
the paternal allele, the imprinted control region between Igf2 and H19 is
methylated. This methylation can spread to CpG islands of the H19 promoter,
thus silencing H19. Downstream of H19 there are enhancers which act on Igf2,
thus activating Igf2. </p>

<p>In the maternal allele on the other hand, the
imprinted control region is unmethylated, as is the CpG island of the H19
promoter. Due to the unmethylated state of this ICR, an insulator protein, CTCF,
can bind to it. This insulates the ICR from the downstream enhancer, which
instead act on H19. So while in the paternal allele, Igf2 is expressed, in the maternal
allele H19 is expressed. </p>

<span>Igf2 is an oncogene,
so if imprinting is disrupted at the H19/Igf2 cluster in a way that the
maternal allele aberrantly expresses Igf2, the resulting upregulation of Igf2
promotes cancer. This is what happens in Wilm’s tumour, in which the ICR is
aberrantly methylated, thus leading to double expression of Igf2.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor
(DNMTi), used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. DNMTis are
nucleoside analogues which get incorporated into DNA during replication. They
can then bind DNA methyltransferases, making them less available for
methylating DNA. DNMTis are replication-dependent and therefore act more
efficiently on cancer cells because they are more rapidly replicating than
normal cells. Myelodysplastic syndromes are associated with hypermethylations
at CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes, so by the above-mentioned mode of
action of DNMTis, including decitabine, the action of tumour suppressor
proteins can be restored.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, so an
altered state of DNA methylation will also be present in daughter cells after
cell division. Therefore, the effect of drugs on epigenetic marks can have a
continued effect on progeny cells. </p>

<p>In germ cells and at early development epigenetic
reprogramming occurs, when epigenetic marks are removed. During
differentiation, the epigenetic marks are then remodeled. These periods of
development are therefore sensitive with regard to external events which could
impact epigenetics, for example causing imcomplete erasure or defective remodeling,
both of which could have devastating effects on the organism.This is also why younger
patients who have developing germ cells in sensitive periods should not be
treated with drugs which affect the epigenetic machinery. </p></div>
