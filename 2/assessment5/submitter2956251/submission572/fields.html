    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are found in about 60% of promoters.  These islands are usually kept demethylated whether they are active or inactive.  This is an exception to the general rule that most (70-80%) of all CpG dinucleotides are methylated in mammalian somatic cells.  In cancer cells, CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated.  The exact role of DNA methylation is context dependent, however in general, cancer would select for CpG island hypermethylation if it silenced a tumor suppressor gene and allowed the tumor to grow faster.<br /><br />Intergenic DNA and repetitive elements (LINE, SINE and microsatellite repeats) are normally kept methylated.  The purposes of the methylation include silencing transposons, maintaining genomic integrity, silencing any cryptic transcription start sites or splice sites, and to prevent illegitimate recombination.  In contrast to local DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands, the hallmark of cancer is global hypomethylation elsewhere.  This occurs in virtually all known tumors and progresses with increasing tumorigenicity.  Loss of intergenic methylation allows reciprocal translocations due to illegitimate recombination.  Cryptic promoters may become activated.  Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters may cause oncogene activation, as is seen in r-ras in gastric cancer.  Hypomethylation at imprint control regions causes loss of imprinting.  All of these changes contribute to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 is a growth factor that may behave like an oncogene when overexpressed.  On the paternal allele, the ICR for the Igf2/H19 cluster is methylated.  This prohibits CTCF, an insulator protein, from binding.  Also, methylation spreading silences the H19 lncRNA.  As a result, downstream enhancers can target the Igf2 due to chromatin looping, causing expression of this oncogene.<br /><br />In contrast, the Igf/H19 cluster is demethylated in the maternal allele.  This allows binding of the CTCF insulator protein, which blocks the downstream enhancers from interacting with the Igf2 gene.  Instead the enhancers target the H19 lncRNA which is expressed.<br /><br />Loss of imprinting may result in silencing or overexpression of Igf2.  In Wilm's tumor there is hypermethylation of the ICR on both maternal and paternal alleles.  H19 is not expressed and the enhancers on both chromosomes target the Igf2 protein.  Overexpression of Igf2 promotes tumor growth. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic drugs called DNMT inhibitors.  These drugs are nucleoside analogues that are incorporated into cancer cell DNA and then irreversibly bind DNMT (DNA methyltransferase) enzymes. DNMT maintains epigenetic marks during cell division by methylating the daughter DNA strand.  Decitabine halts the activity of DNMT and prevents methylation of DNA.  This can enhance or suppress tumorigenesis depending on context.  Older studies used high doses of DNMT inhibitors, which had a toxic, nonspecific effect on cells.  Newer studies show promise using lower doses of the drug.  A possible anti-tumor effect is unmethylation and activation of tumor suppressor genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can be mitotically heritable, thus treatment of a tumor with a short course of an epigenetic drug can affect all future daughter cells.  These long term effects have important implications for treating younger patients.  There are sensitive periods during a patient's life where epigenetic marks are being reset and may be altered by the environment or drugs.  The two waves of reprogramming are during the pre-implantation period of early development, and later during primordial germ cell development.  Using epigenetic drugs during these periods could have disastrous consequences for the health of a developing fetus.  Also men should avoid fathering a child while on these drugs due to possible disruption of epigenetic marks during spermatogenesis.  In fact these warnings appear on the FDA prescribing information for Decitabine and Azacitadine.</div>
