    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are usually located at promoters of genes. DNA methylation at those CpG islands is commonly synonimous of silencing of the expression of these genes. This DNA methylation is related with the formation of a more condensed chromatin structure, which difficults the binding of the transcription factors to the DNA. Silencing transposon and retrotransposon genes prevent transposition and prevent illegitimate recombination, maintaining genome integrity.<br />Despite, CpG islands are usually unmethylated. There are the intergenic regions and repetitive elements that are usually methylated. In cancer, in contrast, CpG islands in the promoter regions are heavily methylated and intergenic regions and repetitive elements tent to be unmethylated. This alters the expression pattern of the genes whose promoter region has change the methylation status, which can be specially crucial if they are suppressor tumor genes. The unmethylation of repetitive elements can induce genomic instabilyty.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 is a cluster of genes that´s usually paternally imprinted. In the maternal alelle the ICR is unmethylated and it is bind by the CTCF insulator protein. This protein insulates Igf2 gene from the downstream enhancers and preventing its expression. The downstream enhancers acts then over the H19 gene inducing its expressión. Then in the maternal chromosome we have expressión of H19 and no expression of Igf2. <br />The paternal ICR is methylated, and the CTCF insulator protein can´t bind to this ICR. Then the downstream enhancers can now act over the Igf2 gene promoving its expression. The methylation of the ICR region is spread over the neighbouring region and this includes the promoter region of the H19 gene, silencing it. Then in the paternal chromosome we have no expression of H19 and expression of Igf2. <br /> In the case that the maternal allele is also methylated, like it were two paternal alleles. This individual has double Igf2 dose, which is a grow factor, inducing the Wilm´s tumour formation. <br /> Most imprinted genes are related with grow and that´s why the loss of imprinting marks is related with tumours specially in childhood. It occurs as a very early event, in preneoplastic tissues. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that acts as DNMT inhibitor. It binds ireversible to DNMTs after they are incorporated to DNA and avoid the DNA methylation. Like they binds DNMTs after they are in the DNA, they are replication depedent. Cancer cells are more actively dividing, so they will be more severely affected by this drug. Anyway, the mechanism of action is still unclear. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Many epigenetic marks are determined by DNA methylation. Maternal and paternal genome imprinting is erased and reseted during early development and during germ cell development. Imprinted genes are also erased and its methylation is restored during primordial germ cell development. This makes this two periods sensitive periods, because if something alters the reseting of the methylation during them, this will alter the epigenome, and the further expression of imprinted genes will be altered. <br /> Altering the DNA methylation we can change the expression pattern of multitude of genes, having different effects in different cell types. Like DNA methylation patterns are heritable through cell division this changes of the expression are herited by daughter cells, having long lasting effects. If those changes are produced during sensitive periods the change on the epigenome is even bigger because the DNA methilation is being reseting.<br /></div>
