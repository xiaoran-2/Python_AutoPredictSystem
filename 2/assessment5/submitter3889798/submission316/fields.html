    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><b>CpG islands</b>, which are found in about 60% of promoters, are <b>unmethylated </b>in healthy cells.</span> Methylation of CpGs is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure that leads to silencing.</p><p>In <b>cancer</b> cells, promoters tend to become <b>hypermethylated</b>. This hypermethylation provokes the silencing of tumor supressor genes, that is, genes controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. </p><p><br /></p><p><b>Intergenic regions </b>and <b>repetitive elements,</b> such as satellite repeats or LINEs and SINEs in human DNA,<b> </b>are usually <b>methylated</b>. This methylation helps to maintain genomic integrity. <br /></p><p>In <b>cancer </b>cells, these regions become <b>hypomethylated</b>, causing genomic instability. This instability allows illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">CTCF is an isulator protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers, allowing these enhancers to activate unmethylated H19 expression.<br /><br />In healthy cells, the <b>paternal </b>allele of H19 is methylated, which allows the expression of Igf2. Instead, the no-methylation of the <b>maternal </b>allele allows the transcription of H19, preventing the activation of Igf2.<br /><br />In <b>Wilm's tumor</b>, the maternal allele is methylated, allowing the Igf2 expression. This means that there will be double expression of Igf2, from both paternal and maternal alleles. This high expression of Igf2 due to the loss of imprinting is a main factor contributing to cancer because Igf2 is a growth promoter.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>Decitabine </b>is a <b>DNMT inhibitor</b>, so it inhibites DNA methylatransferase activity in mammalian cells. <br /><br />Decitabine is a <b>DNA-demethylation agent</b>, meaning that it induces demethylation of hypermethylated regions of DNA in cancer cells. So, Decitabine is able to recover the original methylation status. <br /><br />DNMT inhibitors are nucleoside analogues. This means that they are incorporated to the DNA upon <strong>replication</strong>, so when DNA methyltransferases come to bind it, it copies the methylation status to the daughter strand. Therefore, the action of DNMT inhibitors is division dependant. Consequently, cancer cells, which replicate much more rapidly than most other cells, will be more sensitive to the effect of Decitabine. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The alteration of the DNA methylation state can have <strong>enduring effects </strong>on the epigenome because epigenetics changes are passed on during cell division to daugther cells.<br /><br />A <strong>sensitive period </strong>is the time when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control. We know two important sensitive periods of development, pre-implantation period in early development and primordial germ cell development.<br /><br />Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the effect of the drug would not be maintained throughout the time, allowing cells to recover their cancer epigenetic status. </div>
