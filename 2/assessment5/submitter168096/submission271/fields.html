    <div class="field-value">When talking about DNA methylation in cancer, we can broadly divide the genome into CpG islands and "the rest". <br />CpG islands are a marker of promoters and as such, are often unmethylated and signal active genes. In cancer cells CpG islands are more likely methylated, effectively silencing all the genes not necessary for survival of the cancer. This is especially important for Tumor Suppressor Genes and silencing them via methylation of their promotes' CpG islands can count as one of the two necessary hits of the Knudson hypothesis.<br />Conversely, the "rest" of the genome is methylated: repetitive elements, intergenic regions and even introns inside active genes. This methylation ensures genome stability, because a lot of repetitive sequences are not unique sequences and, if active, could cause dramatic mutations (e.g. large deletions, translocations). In cancer cells hypomethylation begins early and progresses over time. Activation of the intergenic regions causes genome instability: increases the likelihood of illegitimate recombinations, deletions and duplications. Such mutations may cause more disruption in genes, especially Tumor Suppressor Genes and Oncoges, both of which are crucial for cancer development.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the maternal copy the H19 and IRC upstream of it are not methylated, which means that the enhancers downstream of H19 affect a more proximal insulator element site, H19 is expressed and IGF2 remains largely inactive. The paternal copy has got the H19 and IRC methylated and this makes the enhancers work on IGF2. As IGF2 is important for the size of the growing foetus, maternal copy works to slow the growth and paternal copy to enhance the growth.<br />In Wilm's Tumour the maternal copy becomes methylated similarly to paternal copy, so the cells produce twice as much IGF2, which in turn, supports their growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It means that it removes methyl groups from the DNA, or, more precisely, removes the methylated cytosines, so that the holes can be repaired by normal DNA-repair machinery with un-methylated cytosines. If a tumour, like Wilm's, displays hypermethylation, this drug can push the methylation balance towards the normal side of the spectrum, effectively silencing oncogenes or promoting the expression of previously silenced Tumour Suppresor Genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is maintained through mitosis, so a modification of epigenome at some point may well be kept for the whole life of modified line of cells. The drug may disrupt the epigenome of the cancer cell, and while it is still a cancer cell, it will be more susceptible to all kinds of treatments.<br />In earlier weeks we learned that overfeeding mothers with methyl group donors (or removing them) influences the methylation state of the children, because all organisms go through de-methylation and re-methylation stages. These happen during the early embryo development in somatic cells and somewhat later in the reproductive cells. The time when methylation reprogramming occurs is called "a sensitive period". If a patient was given a drug that disrupts methylation during those sensitive periods, his cells might not be able to write appropriate methylation patterns. This will hinder the normal development of the organism and may even lead to death or cancers.</div>
