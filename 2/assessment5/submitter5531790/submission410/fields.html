    <h1>Submission 410 from Anon (session_user_id: 5fc7ea02a6643fa6890e9d20a02447015850dcc9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating or hypomethylating (antineoplastic or cytotoxic) drug that are used to treat  myelodysplastic syndromes and finally , acute myelogenous leukaemia  (AML).Decitabine hypomethylates the double strand of DNA and inhibiting DNA methyltransferase and show that exposure transient low doses in cultured and primary leukemic and 
epithelial tumor cells will produce an antitumor "memory" response, 
including inhibition of subpopulations of cancer stem-like cells. These 
effects are accompanied by sustained decreases in gene reexpression ,genomewide promoter 
DNA methylation, , and finally antitumor changes in key 
cellular regulatory pathways.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands in normal cells are protected from DNA- methylation by unclear mechanisms, howerver, the DNA-methylation is essential for x inactivation , imprinting ,suppresion of parasitic DNA sequences and regulation of growth cell.In cancer ,the normal methylation patterns are altered in cancer with global 
hyphometilation and region-specific hypermethylation in CpG islands.The Global hypomethylation due to disruption in DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) may promote mitotic recombination and chromosome rearrangement ultimately resulting in aneuploidy  when the chromosomes fail to separate properly during mitosis .When the hypermethylation events occur within the promoter of a tumor suppresor genes, and will silence the gene and provide a growth instability , altered chromatin structure and cancer. The mechanism of cancer is demostrated in methylated CpG within the coding region and predispose this region to mutation due to deamination and failure to repair resulting in a point mutation.<br /><br />In the other hand, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contribute in normal conditions at genomic stability, regulation of telomere lengh repression of transposable elements and imprinted genes, otherwise,In cancer, the intergenic regions are hyphomethylated (promoters , enhancers and non-coding RNA)  and provide deregulation of genetic expression, in the other side, the repetitive elements (SINEs , LINEs ,Alu sequences, centromere sequences , and telomere sequences) also are hypomethylated and contribute in alterations of DNA sequences that finally lead to cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal individuals, IGF2 (insuline growth factor 2) expression is from the paternal allele and H19 is from the maternal allele.,IC1 (Imprint control region 1) and DMR0 (Differentialy methylated region 0) are methylated on the paternal chromosome. In BWS (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome) , the epigenotype and expression pattern of the maternal chromosome are converted to paternal and in SRS (Silver-Russell syndrome), the epigenotype and expression pattern of the paternal chromosome are converted to maternal (imprint switching). In the Wilms tumour, IGF2 activation and H19 silencing are associated with disruption of both maternal and paternal imprints (somatic loss of imprinting).<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> DNA methylation alterations can long-term effects and may be mediated by epigenetic modification to the promoter regions of steroid receptor genes that control the maternal care and behavioral.DNA methylation may be critical to maternal effects on<div>gene expression and thus generate phenotypic differentiation of offspring and, through effects on maternal behavior of offspring, mediate the transmission of these effects across generations.The sensitive period indicate that the treatment with a drug that modify the DNA methylation have a little rank tolerance in a certain age , thus , can have adverse effects. In embryo-development,childhood and adolescence, DNA methylation is in a sensitive period and the overexpression  of DNA methylation can have adverse effects such as early cancer ,distinct types of lymphoma and blood cancer but the overdose of drug for the treatment in sensitive periods also can have adverse effects for example, cytotoxicity and rapid DNA damage, so that's why,  treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
