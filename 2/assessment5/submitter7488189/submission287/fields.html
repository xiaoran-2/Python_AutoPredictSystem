    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG
islands are usually located at promoter region of the gene. In normal cells,
only small portion of CpG islands are methylated between
cell types, but most retain unmethylated. CpG island methylation is associated
with X-chromosome inactivation. In cancer cell, CpG islands become hypermethylated in promoters, which cause silencing of gene expression, especially tumor suppressors; in turn
cause uncontrolled tumor cells grow. </p>

<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements
in the gene are usually methylated. DNA methylation in the intergenic regions
maintains genomic integrity by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or
cryptic splice sites. DNA methylation at the repetitive elements also maintains
genomic integrity by silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, avoid
transcriptional interference from strong promoter and prevent unwanted
recombination. In cancer cells, DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive
elements become hypomethylated, which cause more active gene expression, less
genomic integrity, more cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In Maternal allele, imprinting control
region (ICR) are non-methylated on H19/Igf2 cluster, CTCF
binds ICR, which blocks the downstream enhancer to activate igf2 gene
expression.</p>

<p><span>In paternal
allele: DNA methylation at ICR blocks the binding of CTCF to ICR region and DNA methylation
spreads to <i>H19 </i>promoter. Without CTCF binding, the downstream enhancers access and activate <i>Igf2.</i></span></p>

<p>In Wilm’s
tumour, hypermethylation of ICR also occurs in maternal allele to lead Igf2
overexpression. Ifg2 regulates cell growth and differentiation. Especially in
the embryo growth and development, therefore the lost of imprinting in H19/Igf2 ICR
causes overexpression of Igf2 and leads to fetal overgrowth, results Wilm's tumor, a type of pediatric
kidney cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decytitabine is a DNA-demethylating agents, which target
DNMTs (DNA methyltransferase).  DNMTs
transfer methyl group to DNA and causes DNA methylation. DNMT3a and 3b are de
novo DNA methyltransferase, while DNMT1 maintains DNA methylation with the
newly synthesized DNA. In tumor cells, CpG islands become hypermethylated and decytitabine
reduce DNA methylation by inhibiting DNMTs function, and most importantly, the reduced methylation on CpG islands passed on to new generation of cells. Therefore, Decytitabine
has anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Stephen Baylin et al have shown that a combination of a
histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine (demethylation agent) slowed
tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. Both agents cause epigenetic changes in epigenome. Since <span>DNA
methylation are mitotically heritable due to the DNMT1, and the epigenetic changes </span>will be able to pass on
with cell division until the tumor cells are completely killed. Therefore, combining
those drugs with standard chemotherapy, once those tumor cells are killed, they do
not come back.</p><p>Cancer
are fasting grow cells, but those epigenetic drugs are not selective, cautions are needed when using those epigenetic treatment with pregnant women or younger
patients.Sensitive
period refers to the early development and primordial germ cells development
during embryo development. Those two periods are the major stages of epigenetic
reprogramming, meaning
DNA methylation is low and epigenetic marks are
removed. If the drugs given during the sensitive periods, they will prevent
methylation during reprogramming from happening in embryo, therefore, can cause more damage.</p></div>
