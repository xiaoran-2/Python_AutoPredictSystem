    <div class="field-value">Normally, the function at CpG islands of DNA methylation is to silence the genes. The basic idea is when you have cancer, the genes wiil be hypermethylated at tumor-suppressor genes and hypomethylated at other genes included oncogenes, so the suppressor is silenced while the oncogene is activated. The consequences of disrupting DNA methylation at CpG islands are the oncogenes can become hyperplasia then cancer because they are hyper-regulated and also their suppressor genes were "suppressed". DNA methylation also affect on ICRs: on one hand, they decrease expression of tumor- restricting genes, on the other hand, they overwhelming our body with genes that promote growth. <br />As for intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation is usually occurs. They keep the genes, more specific, the chromosomes from reconstruction or recombination. In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated, so the chromosomes are more fragile and unstable, When there are problems with DNA hypomethylation in those regions, the chromosomes are not densed anymore, they move around or be deleted etc. The result is the tumor have chance to grow when you have problems with your genome, as well as the oncogenes are enhanced and the suppressors are no longer around.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">For the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is methylated at ICR blocks so that the CTCF can't bind it, then the methylation spread to silent H19 promoter, the result is the enhancers can now activate Igf2. In maternal allele, ICR are unmethylated, so CTCF protein can bind it, then H19 promoter is transcript lead to inactivation of Igf2. Loss of imprinting of the Igf2 gene cause activation of the maternal allele lead to increase Ifg2 then Wilm's tumour appears. An increased amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 may stimulate the 
growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells from being destroyed.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine inhibits the enzyms which attach methyl groups to histone proteins. Decitabine has effect of a DNA-demethylated drug. Normally, when the methylation process is overexpressed, the tumor-suppressor genes are also down-regulated, this lead to the developement of cancer and tumor. Decitabine have demethylation effect so it can help with anti-tumour effect by reducing supression effect on tumour-suppressor genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The long-lasting effect of DNA demethylation drugs on the epigenome is due to the mitotic heritability of daughter cells, the effects are transfered continously through many cell generations until the epigenetic marks are erased then they never return. A sensitive period is the time when the genome is easily affected by drugs, rays, etc. Sensitive periods of development is from week 3ed to week 8th. Treating patients during this periods may have bad effect on gastrulation process, lead to mutation etc.<br /></div>
