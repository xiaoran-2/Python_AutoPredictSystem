    <h1>Submission 455 from Anon (session_user_id: fa82dac7fcf9c93c688b3d4e7bb04b0b7873402b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA Methyltransferase
inhibitors (DNMTi). </p>

<p>It is an
analogue of nucleosides that bind permanently to the active site of the
methyltransferases once they are incorporated into the DNA. This means that
they only become functional when the DNA is undergoing replication. The result
is the DNMTs being unable to lay down the methylation marks on the newly
forming DNA strand. </p>

<p>Decitabine
can have an anti-tumour effect in cancers where tumour suppressor genes have
been hypermethylated, silencing them. These genes usually defend the cell from
becoming cancerous so this drug works well in these cases as it blocks DMNTs
from adding excessive methyl groups onto the replicating DNA strand. Decitabine
has shown good outcomes in patients with blood cancers and is even being
trialled on solid tumours. <br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the
H19/Igf2 cluster, the methylation patterns differ between the paternal and
maternal alleles. In the paternal allele, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is
methylated. This means that the H19 non-coding (nc)RNA located downstream of the ICR is not expressed, and the enhancers located further downstream act on the Igf2 locus, allowing its expression. In addition, a protein called the CTCF protein is unable to bind to the ICR when it is methylated.<br /></p><p>In the
maternal allele, the CTCF protein binds to the ICR preventing methylation. This
results in the enhancers acting on the H19 ncRNA, leading to its expression.
The ncRNA in turn suppresses the expression of the Igf2 locus. 

</p><p>In Wilm’s
tumor, the ICR of the maternal allele becomes methylated, just like the
paternal allele. This results in a double dose of Igf2 expression. Igf2 is a
growth promoting gene. This uncontrolled growth is what causes the Wilm's tumour phenotype. <br /></p>

<p>Disrupting
the imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer because it results
in the over-expression of a growth promoting gene. Normal cells have a very
tightly regulated balance of growth promoting and suppressing genes. An imbalance in this system could lead to uncontrolled growth, i.e. cancer. <br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands in normal cells are
usually hypomethylated. On the other hand, there is often a hypermethylation
of CpG islands in cancer cells.The 2kb of genome neighbouring the
CpG island also show hypermethylation in cancer compared to normal cells. This disruption in DNA methylation
patterns in the CpG islands can contribute to cancer because it can lead to the
silencing of important genes such as tumor suppressor genes. These disruptions
are mitotically heritable and are rapidly selected for. This means that they
can contribute to the formation of a tumor more rapidly than a genetic
mutation. 

</p>

<p>Imprint control regions (ICR) can also be
hypermethylated in some cancers. This can result in the over-expression of
growth promoting genes or decreased expression of growth restriction genes. For
example, in the case of Wilm’s Tumor, there is a loss of imprinting on the
maternal allele, resulting in the methylation of the ICR in this allele.  This leads to a double dose of Igf2 product, a growth promoting
factor.</p>

<p>In normal cells, the intergenic and
repetitive elements in the genome are hypermethylated, whereas in cancer they
are hypomethylated.This disruption can lead to genomic
instability. This can include the activation of repeats and transposition of
them. For example, the Axin fused allele in mice is the result of a
transposable element (an intracisternic A particle) being inserted into a gene,
disrupting its function, which results in a kinked tail phenotype. A similar
event can occur in human cells, where a transposable element inserts into
important tumor suppressing genes, or activates growth promoting genes,
resulting in cancer formation.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic
mark that is mitotically heritable. There is also evidence of transgenerational
inheritance through the gametes. Any changes to DNA methylation patterns could
be long lasting through cell lines and through gamete transmission. Many cases of this have been documented in humans, where grandchildren are affected by the womb environment of the grandmother due to the developing gametes in the foetus. <br /></p>

<p>Sensitive periods occur during
various stages in mammalian development when an alteration in environmental
factors has an effect on epigenetic regulation. This corresponds with the resetting of epigenetic marks, otherwise known as epigenetic reprogramming. The maternal and paternal genome are stripped of their methylation marks at different rates, but added again at a similar rate. <br /></p><p>These periods occur in the
pre-implantation stage (from zygote formation until epiblast stage) and during
primordial germ cell development. </p>



<p>Treating patients during these
stages would be inadvisable because the effects could be long lasting, and even cause downstream problems in future generations<br /></p></div>
