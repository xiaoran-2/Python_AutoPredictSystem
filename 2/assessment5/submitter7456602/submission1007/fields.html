    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA is normally unmethylated in CpG islands, with the exception of the inactive X chromosome, which shows DNA methylation at this site. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements on the other hand, are generally hypermethylated as a way to protect the genome integrity from transposable elements.</p>
<p>In a cancer cell, methylation at CpG islands tend to increase over time, causing silencing of tumour suppressor genes and therefore facilitate the action of oncogenes in the transformation of normal cells into an abnormal growth tissue. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements, are unmethylated in a cancer cell, causing genome instability and therefore deletions, reciprocal translocations insertions and duplications. Aberrant epigenetic control can have an effect on all of hallmarks of Cancer.</p><div><span><br /></span></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is normally unmethylated in the maternal allele, so the CTCF can binds the ICR and therefore prevent the action of the downstream enhancers on Igf2, they go for H19 instead. The paternal allele, on the other hand, is methylated in the imprinted control region (ICR), in other words is imprinted preventing the binding of the CTCF insulator protein and therefore allowing the action of the enhancers on the Igf2.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span>Wilm’s tumour or nephroblastoma is often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue. In this case paternal as well as maternal are imprinted, so enhancers can act on  Both alleles, producing an overexpression of the Igf2 gene, which is associated with Wilm’s tumour. This alteration in DNA methylation, hypo or hypermethylations at ICR can lead to the loss of expression of growth restricting genes or the overexpression of growth promoting genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) a nucleoside analogue that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. After decitabine is incorporated into the DNA, it binds irreversibly to DNMT so it can no longer be release. </p>
<p>DNMT inhibitors are division or replication dependent, that produce DNA demethylation.</p>
<p><span>Haematological malignancies are dependent on tumour suppressor genes hypermethylation (silencing) on the CpG islands, therefore the demethylation of these sites, generates a reactivation of the epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor genes, consequently generating a tumour suppressor effect.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that can alter DNA methylation have enduring effects beyond the period of the drug, as epigenetic changes in DNA methylation are mitotically heritable from one cell to the next generation tanks to the action of the methyltransferases which preserve the methyl marks during cell division. </p>
<p>There are some periods during development when one would avoid the use of drugs that can change DNA methylation on patients. These are the periods of epigenetic reprogramming, the sensitive periods, when marks are established rather than maintained and this happens during embryogenesis and gametogenesis. So one should not use these drugs on <span>pregnant females to prevent any interference cause by this drug on the correct epigenetic reprogramming during embryogenesis as well as during the formation of gametes.</span></p></div>
