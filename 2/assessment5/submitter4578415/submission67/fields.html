    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>1.      
The normal function of DNA methylation is to
maintain genomic stability; However, at CpG islands, which constitute a very
small part of DNA, methylation occurs rarely: generally CpG islands are
unmethylated.  If methylation happens,
its function is transcriptional repression. </p>

<p>2.      
Cancer-related disruptions of CpG islands occur
through increasing methylation intensity in CpG islands.  Methylation of CpG Islands collaborates with
histone modifications stimulating accumulation of silencing marks.</p>

<p>3.      
DNA methylation in CpG islands contributes to
cancer by inactivation of surrounding tumor suppressing genes.</p>

<p>4.      
The normal function of DNA methylation in
intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to block expression of genes in
these loci.</p>

<p>5.      
The normal  DNA methylation in intergenic regions and
repetitive elements is disrupted by unmethylating these regions in cancer.<br />
The normal density of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive
elements is lowered in cells affected by cancer.</p>

<p>6.      
Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic
regions and repetitive elements contributes to cancer by giving a competitive
advantage to the cells affected by redistribution of methylation to divide more
rapidly  and  to lengthen their life-time.<br />
Disruption of DNA methylation increases probability of onco gene and repetitive
elements expression in these loci.  It
also decreases genetic stability of the DNA.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.      
The normal methylation pattern of the paternal
allele is the following: ICR is methylated, H19 is methylated and therefore
silent, Igf2 is expressed (the expression is stimulated by the enhancer ).</p>

<p>2.      
In the normal maternal allele, the ICR is
unmethylated, H19 is expressed and Igf2 is silent because CTCF bounded to the ICR
region blocks influence of the enhancer.</p>

<p>3.      
In cancer cells affected by Wilm's syndrome genes
do not display monoallelic parent-of-origin specific expression: the ICR region
is methylated in both paternal and maternal alleles preventing expression of
H19 and allowing expression of Igf2.</p>

<p>4.      
The disrupted imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster
contributes to cancer by doubling the normal expression dose of Igf2, which is
a growth-promoting gene and by blocking expression of H19, which is believed to
be a tumor suppressor.</p><p><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.      
the class of epigenetic inhibitors that
Decitabine belongs to is "epigenetic drug", in particular DNMT1
inhibitor.</p>

<p>2.      
The impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation: It
acts as DNA-demethylating agent.</p>

<p>3.      
Decitabine enables expression of tumor suppressing
genes that were blocked by methylation; alters tumor cells so that they become
more susceptible to standard chemeotherapy.  Acts as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (inhibit
DNMT1).  In particular, the anti-tumour
effect of decitabine is achieved by inducing degradation of DNA
methyltransferase and acting upon replicating cancer cells.  Approved for treating Myelodisplastic syndrome
progressed to AML.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.      
An established state of DNA methylation is
stable within the life-time of the organism and therefore altering the DNA
methylation state is persistent (has enduring effects) on the epigenome</p>

<p>2.      
Sensitive period is the period when epigenetic
marks are established.</p>

<p>3.      
The following identifies sensitive periods of
development: the time after fertilization including early development ending by
formation of epiblast and the period of germ cell development, egg  and sperm maturation. Taking into account
that drug treatment is an environmental effect, the sensitive periods are
inadvisable for 9-to-12 years old boys, and for 8-to-10 years old girls.</p>

<p>4.      
Treating patients during sensitive periods is
inadvisable because it may cause epigenetic abnormalities, such as aberrant
imprinting. </p><p><br /></p></div>
