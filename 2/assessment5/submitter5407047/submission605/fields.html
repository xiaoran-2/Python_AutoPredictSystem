    <div class="field-value">There are 2 types of aberration of DNA methylation found in cancer; locus specific DNA hypermethylation and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. <br /><br />Normally, at CpG islands, DNA are hypomethylated to allow expression of active genes. In cancer, it is found that CpG islands are hypermethylated that leads to silencing tumor suppressor genes and that can be the second hit according to the Knudson hypothesis which also allow suppression of active gene especially tumor suppressor genes. In addition, it is found that cells with alteration of DNA methylation may have competitive advantage to normal cells in term of growth, proliferation as well as survival can that can leaf to tumorigenesis. <br /><br />Interestingly, it is often found genome-wide hypomethylation in intergenic region and repetitive elements in cancer cells or less methylation compared to normal cells. The hypomethylation in the intergenic region and repetitive elements results in genomic instability and can lead to oncogene activation. Once hypomethylation causes the genomic instability, it can lead to an aberrant events like illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition which can jump between genome into promotor region that leads to activation of oncogene.  And that would lead to abnormal cells and develop to cancer cells as consequence. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There is an example of disruption of imprinting in H19/Igf2 cluster that contributes to cancer. Normally, in the paternal allele,  there is DNA methylation to imprint control region (ICR) that block binding of CTCF insulator. Without binding of the insulator, DNA methylation can also spread and silence H19 promotor and also allow downstream enhancers to access and activate Igf2 gene. However, in maternal allele, ICR is not methylated then it allows CTCF binding. Then H19 promotor is activated by enhancers in stead of Igf2 gene. So the result from normal situation is that there the expression of Igf2 gene from paternal allele but there is not expression of Igf2 from maternal allele. <br /><br />However, in case of <span>Wilm’s tumour, there is DNA methylation also in ICR of maternal alleles so it causes loss of imprinting. This loss of imprinting results in excessed expression of Igf2 genes as sum of both paternal and additional maternal alleles. The result is overexpression of Igf2 which is growth promoting genes and that contributes to cancer development.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a FDA-approved drug to treat MDS and it is catergorized as DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). This drug acts as nucleoside analogues that incorporated into DNA and irreversibly bind to the enzyme methyltransferase. It exhibits the anti-tumor effect because once it binds to the enzyme, it inactivates the enzyme and leads to hypomethylation in newly synthesized DNA strand. And that can lead to reactivation tumor suppressor genes, previously quiescent, to slow down the growth of tumor, lead to cell death or apoptosis and may enhance sensitivity to other chemotherapeutic agents as treatment to solid tumor as well.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Epigenetic drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because the change of DNA methylation can be passed on during cell devision (mitotic inheritable), even to next or later generation. So the effect of the drug is maintained. In addition, this kind of changes caused by epigenetic drugs can be actively erased during epigenetic reprogramming and they will not return. <br /><br />Anyhow, there is such a period called 'sensitive periods' which occur during embryogenesis and gametogenesis that epigenetic marks are established and will be carried out through lifetime and following generations. So patient should not be treated during this time because it will alter epigenetic profile permanently and that can lead to unpredictable adverse events and might be inherited to later generations.  </span></div>
