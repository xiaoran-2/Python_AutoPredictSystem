    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are regions of DNA with high percentage of CG dinucleotides. Usually, this regions are not methylated and they are present in 60% of promoters. It is known that DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. In cancer cells, CpG islands are frecuently hypermethylated causing silencing of the underlying genes. The genes silenciated by hypermethylation in cancer cells tend to be<span> tumor suppressor genes and this causes cell cycle desregulation.  <br />Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences and generally this regions are methylated in highly expressed genes. A role of methylated intragenic sequences has been suggested, this regions</span> may repress transcriptional noise, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing. <span> Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells generally suffer a loss of methylation. This hipomethylation usually causes genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes. <br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19 and Igf2 expression is coupled. On the paternal allele the H19 promoter is hypermethylated whereas on the maternal allele the H19 promoter is hipomethylated. The hypermethylation on H19 promoter of the paternal allele alllows the expression of Igf2 from the same cromosome and inhibits the expression of H19. In contrast, the hipomethylation on H19 promoter of the maternal allele inhibits Igf2 expression from the maternal allele and allows the expression of H19. <span>In conclussion, in normal cells the paternal Igf2 and maternal H19 genes are expressed.  </span><span> <br /></span>Wilm’s tumour i<span><span>s a type of cancer that affects the kidneys and typically occurs only in children. In this king of tumor cells, </span><span>the maternal H19 promoter is hypermethylated causing an equivalence of epigenetic regulation between maternal and paternal allele of this particular locus. The effect is an overexpression of Igf2 and a lost of H19 expression. This missregulation is supose to increases cell growth generating a cancer fenotype. </span><br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a new </span>epigenetic drug used in cancer treatments. It corresponds to a DNA-demethylating agent that inhibits DNA methyltransferases generating a genome-wide hipomethylation effect. Since many of epigenetic desregulations in cancer cells are generated by DNA hypermethylation in specific regions, treatment with a demethylating agent can revert the increase in DNA methylation and stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. <br />For example, Decitabine can reverts the hypermethylation on the maternal H19 promoter and, at the same time, reverts hypermethylation on promoter CpG island of <span>tumour-suppressor genes inducing it expression. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Since epigenetic changes as DNA methylation can be passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells, any alteration on DNA methylation will have enduring effects on the epigenome. That is the explanation of why drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment. <br />However there are some sensitive periods </span>of development when treating patients with such drugs should be avoided. A sensitive period of development is considered when the epigenome is most vulnerable to environmental insults. This periods present extensive epigenetic reprogramming. The most important <span>sensitive period of development is</span> during early embryonic development. <br />In the case of treatment with this drug during sensitive periods, many changes in DNA methylation would be generated. This changes could induce gene expression desregulation and can generate or improve cancer dissease instead of stop it. </div>
