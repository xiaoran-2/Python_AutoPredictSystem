    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with the compactification of the chromatin and hence  with silenced genes. In cancer, previously unmethylated CpG islands become hypermethylated which will silence normally active genes, in general, tumor suppressor genes. By silencing the tumor suppressor genes, cells can escape apoptosis and over proliferate.<br /><br />DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements prevents chromosome interactions, unlike in cancer where the hypomethylation of these regions drives the genomic instability by permitting deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions. Any of these three transformation can lead to an aberrant functioning of the cell that will lead to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Sometimes genes can show the parent of origin by having different methylation patterns on the chromosome from each parent. This can be seen in the cluster H19/Igf2.<br /><br />On the paternal allele, the CTCF site - which controls expression of Igf2 - is methylated. The methylation will not permit CTCF binding and hence Igf2 will be expressed. Also, H19 is methylated which will permit the enhancers to boost the expression of Igf2. <br /><br />On the contrary, on the maternal allele, the CTCF site is unmethylated which will silence the Igf2. Also, H19 is unmethylated which will occupy the enhancers.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, these differences in the methylation patterns is disrupted and the two alleles have the same methylation pattern as the paternal allele. This will lead to overexpression of Igf2, and, since Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, it will lead to overproliferation, and hence to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that can demethylate, if properly targetted, the hypermethylated CpG islands in cancer. So, it can have an anti-tumor effect by restoring a normal methylation pattern at some genes in a cancer cell. This in turn will reactivate the tumor suppressor genes, and the cell will be able to fight back with other anomalies present in the cell by choosing, for example, to trigger apoptosis.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, when the DNA methylation is altered the new methylation pattern will be transmitted to the daughter cells if cell death will be prevented. So, a drug that alters DNA methylation can show his effect throughout generations of cells. <br /><br />More sensitive to such drugs are cells where DNA methylation patterns are being put into place by the normal molecular machinery. Two telling examples of the sensitive periods, where the epigenetic marks are being written, are shortly after fecundation, and after the appearance of primordial germ cells where the DNA methylation patterns are wiped down and rewritten in the whole organism for the first example, and only in the cells destined to become the gametes in the second case.<br /><br />If a drug would be administered in a sensitive period, the DNA methylation pattern would be highly aberrant. For example, inserting DNA methylation enzymes in a wipe down phase, can lead to remethylation in unwanted places that can deturn the normal development. So, it is highly inadvisable to use epigenetic drugs during pregnancy especially in the sensitive periods.</div>
