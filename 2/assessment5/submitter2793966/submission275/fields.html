    <div class="field-value">    As a general rule, CpG islands, which are regions of the DNA that contain a lot of cytosine and guanine bases, and that are normally unmethylated in normal cells, become progressively more and more methylated as cancer develops. These islands, when methylated, suppress gene expression in neighboring cis regions of the genome. In cancer cells, CpG islands near tumor suppressor genes tend to be prefferentially methylated, which means that the cell lacks the ability to suppress mechanisms that lead to tumor development. <br />    Another way that DNA methylation is altered in cancer is in the DNA found between genes. Because the DNA between genes is generally not transcribed, these areas are silenced in normal cells and maintained as heterochromatin. One of the reasons for this is that during cell division, translocations between chromosomes can occur, which is when a piece of one chromosome becomes stuck to another. This disrupts the genetic architecture of the genome, which can lead to overexpression or silencing of the genes in the vicinity of the location of the translocation. <br />    A disruption of the genetic architecture is also likely (sometimes even more so) because intergenic regions include areas with repetitive elements. Repetitive elements are sequences of DNA that are repeated numerous times, and are often found in numerous places across the genome. These elements are normally methylated in cells because the sequence similarity between different areas with these repetitive elements increase the likelihood that a chromosomal translocation will occur. In addition, repetitive elements include "parasitic" pieces of DNA such as transposons and retrotransposons, the silencing of which is necessary because these sequences code for a mechanism that copies and/or cuts the DNA of the transposon/retrotransposon and inserts it elsewhere on the genome. This can lead to over/under-expression of genes, causing cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, there is a region in the igf2 cluster that is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. In the maternal allele, this lack of methylation allows a protein to bind that blocks the enhancers found nearby from looping and increasing the expression of igf2, a gene which promotes cell growth. Thus, expression of igf2 on the maternal allele is suppressed. On the paternal allele, however, the area which was unmethylated in the maternal allele is methylated, which blocks the protein from binding to it. Since there is nothing preventing the enhancers from looping to increase the expression of igf2, the paternal allele does express this cell growth protein. <br />In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele is methylated like the paternal allele (that, or the individual with the tumor inherited two paternal copies), leading to an overexpression of igf2, creating a situation of overgrowth and therefore tumor/cancer development. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, which means that it is involved in the removal of methyl groups from DNA. DNA methylation is involved in silencing the genes in its vicinity. If tumor suppressor genes are being silenced through DNA methylation (perhaps of CpG islands upstream of the tumor suppressor genes), decitabine would remove the methyl groups and therefore restore the expression of tumor suppressor genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">    DNA methylation is involved in silencing genes as well as in compacting chromatin into heterochromatin. By altering it, you are either increasing or decreasing expression of the neighboring genes. The effects of this on the cells completely depend on the genes affected, which could include genes that are involved in resistance against chemotherapy drugs, thus affecting the sensitivity of tumor cells to such drugs. Alternatively, the genes involved could be part of the epigenetic machinery itself, which could increase or decrease the expression of enzymes involved in methylating DNA or histones, and this could have an enduring effect on the epigenome. <br />    This epigenetic machinery is especially active during certain periods of development, namely during the production of gametes and during embryonic development. A great deal of epigenetic remodeling occurs during these periods that has lasting effects throughout the rest of the organism's lifetime. Because alterations of this remodeling can have such lasting consequences (such as is the case with gene imprinting and with cancer), these periods are called sensitive periods. It is therefore inadvisable to alter the epigenetic processes of patients that contain cells during these sensitive periods (such as in individuals that are producing gametes or in pregnant females) . <br /></div>
