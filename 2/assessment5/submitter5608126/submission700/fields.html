    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as 
imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of 
heterochromatin. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state.
 However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become 
hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene.
 Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as 
satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs 
and SINEs in human DNA.
 Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has 
been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from 
alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA 
splicing and relates to replication timing. Comparison of the methylome of different hematopoietic lineages has 
identified a large number of hypomethylated regions (HMRs), which can be
 constitutive or lineage-specific and colocalize with transcription 
factor binding sites.  <br />Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional 
gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability and
 deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other 
hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, 
apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG 
islands. Another target of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer are CpG island 
shores, defined as approximately 2 kb regions surrounding CpG islands. 
These regions were initially identified hypermethylated in colorectal 
cancer and represent regions of tissue specific methylation in normal 
tissues<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The longest-known examples for this are lncRNAs involved in epigenetic 
silencing and imprinting, such as the X-inactivation promoting lncRNA 
XIST, which recruits the Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) to silence 
the X chromosome from which it is transcribed  and TSIX, which is transcribed from the opposite strand and regulates XIST levels during X-inactivation.
 Other lncRNAs involved in imprinting processes are the paternally 
expressed lncRNA AIR, which is required for silencing the maternally 
expressed protein-coding genes Igf2r/Slc22a2/Slc22a3 and inhibits expression by targeting the H3K9 histone methyltransferase G9a to the Slc22a3 promoter,
 and paternally expressed lncRNA Kcnq1ot1, which mediates 
lineage-specific silencing of the Kcnq1 locus by interaction with the 
PRC2 complex and G9a HMT in placenta, but not in fetal liver.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agents,which is available in the form of azacitidine. They  are histone-deacetylase inhibitors and used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia ,cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.  <br />Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription 
factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell 
division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively 
erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be 
that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing
 without having to kill all its cells.<br />This epigenetic drugs also deployed successfully against a solid tumour.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription

that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing
 without having to kill all its cells.A combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. This show an unexpectedly good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them next.<br /></div>
