    <h1>Submission 790 from Anon (session_user_id: a02d2d37417bdabd563fd5fffbfb61ca9e7c86d8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>A current
definition of epigenetics is: “The study of mitotically and/or meiotically
heritable changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in DNA
sequence” (Russo et al., 1996</b><b><span>). There are
two epigenetic systems that affect animal development and fulfill the criterion
of heritability: DNA methylation and the Pc-G/trx protein complexes.  By altering DNA methylation through
medication or cancerous transformations (i.e., by altering the expression of the
DNMT family of enzymes) the epigenome can suffer enduring modifications that last through generations of cells.</span></b></p><p><b>The sensitive period is a
      period of undefined duration often associated with development and early
      life, during which the organism is more susceptible to epigenetic changes
      through environmental influences.</b></p><b>Early
      embrionic and germ cell development. But since "<i>each organ system develops
      at different stages and then undergoes some form of remodeling later in
      development there are likely to be more sensitive periods"</i> than those enumerated (dr. Marnie Blewitt).</b> <br /><b><br />Exposure
      to drugs during sensitive periods can have profound implications on organ
      systems structures and functions. Early drug exposure can produce hyper- or
      hyporesponsiveness to environmental or pharmacological stimuli later in
      life. Children exposed to drugs pre- or postnatally might respond
      abnormally to other medications later in life.</b></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>Decitabine
belongs to the class of <em>DNA methyltransferase inhibitors</em></b>.<br /><b><br />Decitabine
      is an analogue of the nucleoside cytosine found in DNA (and in RNA,
      but Decitabine has no effect on it) and exerts its effects via two pathways </b><b><span>after
being incorporated into the DNA strand</span></b><b>:
      inhibition of DNA methyltransferase (DNA hypomethylation) at low dose and
      direct cytotoxicity by covalently binding to DNA methyltransferase.<br /></b><br /><strong>By
      inhibiting DNA methyltransferase Decitabine can </strong><em><strong>reactivate </strong></em><strong>epigenetically
      silenced (by methylation) </strong><em><strong>tumor suppressor genes</strong></em><strong>. Decitabine also has a
      </strong><em><strong>direct cytotoxic effect</strong></em><strong> on abnormal hematopoietic cells arising from the
      bone marrow by being heavily incorporated into the DNA strand and causing
      direct cell death.</strong></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>The
imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele and prohibits its binding to the insulator protein CTCF that insulates Igf2 from the
downstream enhancers. Consequently the
downstream enhancers are now free <em>to act on and activate the Igf2 gene</em>. </b><b>The DNA methylation process is also spreading downstream to silence the H19 gene. </b></p><p><b>The
ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele and is bounded
by CTCF that insulates Igf2 from the downstream
enhancers. <em>Igf2 is not expressed.</em> H19 gene expression is enhanced.</b></p><p><b>Wilm’s tumour can appear
      in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, characterized by overexpression of paternally expressed growth
      promoter genes - Igf2 - and loss of maternally expressed growth
      suppressor genes - CDKN1C. In the case of uniparental paternal disomy for 11p15.5 there is overexpression of Igf2, gain of
      methylation at the H19 promoter and loss of the maternally expressed
      CDKN1C.</b></p><p><b>Imprinting
      disruption at the H19/Igf2 cluster creates an imbalance between the
      activity of oncogenes and the activity of antioncogenes. As such, there is an overexpression of the oncongene Igf2  and a lack of expression of the antioncogene CDKN1C. Overexpression of Igf2 and lack of sensitivity to
      antigrowth signals will lead to a limitless cell replication pattern that
      will finally lead to cancer.</b></p></div>

    <div class="field-value"><p><b>DNA methylation – which
is carried out in mammalian cells by the DNMT family of enzymes - plays
critical roles in the maintenance of chromatin integrity and regulation of gene
expression: methylation of CpGs islands (CPGI) can directly impede the binding of
transcription factors to their target sites, thus <em>prohibiting the transcription
of speciﬁc genes</em>. Methylation of CPGI also promotes a <em>highly
condensed heterochromatin structure</em>, where active transcription does not occur.
Methylation of CPGI naturally takes place during X chromosome
inactivation and imprinting. Extensive changes in DNA
methylation during the processes of differentiation are known to take place at
CpG island shores.</b></p><p><b><em>Hypermethylation
during oncogenesis</em> usually occurs at CpGs located in CpG islands of promoters
and usually leads to <em>silencing of gene activity</em>, while the expression of a few
genes may be activated by DNA methylation.</b></p><p><b>DNA hypermethylation at the
      CpG islands of promoters <em>silences speciﬁc genes</em>, including
      tumor-suppressor genes such as CDKN2A, CDKN2B, MLH1, BRCA1, MGMT, VHL, and contributes to<em> evading apoptosis, insensitivity to antigrowth
      signals, sustained angiogenesis, limitless replicative potential, and
      tissue evasion and metastasis</em>. </b><b>DNA hypermethylation of tumor-suppressor genes frequently becomes the second hit for driver events in accordance with Knudson’s two-hit theory.</b></p><p><b>Almost half of
      the mammalian genome is comprised of transposable and viral elements that
      are as such inactivated by DNA methylation. </b><b>In DNA isolated from normal healthy tissue, the methylated domain comprises  sattelite and interspersed repeat sequences, intragenic sequences and single-copy sequences. </b><b>If expressed, these elements
      could be harmful because they could lead to <em>gene disruption</em> and <em>DNA
      mutation</em>.</b></p><p><b>The methylated compartment of
      the genome becomes <em>hypomethylated in cancer </em>and includes all classes of
      repeated sequence, intergenic sequences, the inactive X chromosome and
      imprinted regions.</b></p><p><b>As such transposable elements or endogenous viruses can be activated, <em>fostering DNA rearrangements
and translocations</em>, thus leading to genomic instability.</b></p></div>
