<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">Methylation at CpG island is associated with silencing gene expression. Firstly, meCpG in a CpG island is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure. Secondly, meCpG can prohibit transcription factor binding and alter gene expression. In addition, DNA methylation helps to maintain genomic stability. The hypermethylation of regulatory regions called CpG islands in some tumour suppressor genes causes their inactivation. <span> In cancer, this idealistic scenario is disrupted.</span>DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer. genetic mutation will contribute to cancer. In addition, DNA methylation may affect chromosome irregulation, like loss or duplicate genome, which will lead to canser.<br /><br />DNA methylation is associated<span> in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</span> Firstly, DNA methylation silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites in intergenic regions to maintain genomic integrity. Secondly, methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination at repetitive elements to maintain genomic integrity. Also, DNA methylation is a Genome defense model because DNA methylation is mutagenic, so must also be a benefit i.e. protect the genome from transposable elements.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">the imprinted control region is methylated on the paternal allele. H19 is actually has a role in being a resevoir for a particular micro RNA. It's role as a long non coding RNA which is not bind epigenetic modifier.the imprinted control region is unmethylated on the maternal allele. H19 is bound by a protein called CTCF, CTCF is an insulator protein which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding and without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate.<br /><br /> Igf2 does promote growth, it's an oncogene. So at the bottom of these two clusters and their linkage. What happens is that an effectively appearance of two paternal like alleles and loss of the maternal like allele. Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome is caused by maternal allele behaving like paternal allele, thus, H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.Loss of DNA methylation at ICRs is common in cancer and aberrant expression of imprinted genes results in specific diseases<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span><span><span>Decitabine is an epigenetic modifier that inhibits DNA methyltransferase activity which results in DNA demethylation (hypomethylation) and gene activation by remodeling chromatin.</span><span> Genes are synergistically reactivated when demethylation is combined with histone hyperacetylation.  Biochem/physiolctions 5′-Azadeoxycytidine causes DNA demethylation or hemi-demethylation. DNA demethylation can regulate gene expression and contribute to cancer.</span><br /></span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
