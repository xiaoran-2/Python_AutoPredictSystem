    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is altered in cancer at different places:<br /><br />The normal state is DNA hypomethylation at CpG islands, which allows expression of tumour suppressor genes. However, when the DNA methylation state at CpG islands is disrupted in cancer there is a hypermethylation occuring and this plays a part contributing to cancer development as tumour suppressor genes are silenced. The cancer spreads as the aberrent trait is passed mitotically down to new cells.<br /><br />The normal state is DNA hypermethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In cancer this is disrupted and a genome-wide hypomethylation occurs in these places, as a general rule in all cancers. This allows opportunities for Illegitimate recombinations to occur as the repeats can align when DNA stabilizing hypermethylation is lacking and DNA is exposed as euchromatin. Repeats can also be activated to make copies of themselves, which then get inserted in different parts of the genome and may influence function negatively. Activation of cryptic promoters can also cause gene disruption. All this mayhem in gene processes may influence critical processes and lead to uncontrolled growth, in other words, cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting as illustrated by the H19/Igf2 cluster: <br /><br />The paternal allele normally has methylation at the ICR and H19 and enhancers then act on Igf2, which is expressed. The maternal allele normally is unmethylated at the ICR and an insulator CTCF then binds there and the enhancers instead act on H19, which is expressed, and Igf2 is silent.  <br />Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour as even the maternal allele has methylation at the ICR and H19, like the paternal allele. Igf2 is even expressed from there and you end up with a double amount of Igf2 expressed. This abnormal growth influence leads to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a member of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor class of epigenetic inhibitors. It acts on DNA methylation in that it is a nucleoside analogue which becomes part of DNA during replication and thereafter will bind DNA methyltransferases irreversibly that are met during replication. Cancer cells, which have more active replication than normal cells, are then affected most and hypomethylated.. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome through the possibility of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. The sensitive periods in human development are defined as periods when signals coming from the environment can influence how development progresses. These are the pre-implantation period and the germ cell development period. Treating patients during such sensitive periods would be inadvisable because development or developmental potential might be greatly and negatively influenced away from the normal and affect future individuals.  <br /></div>
