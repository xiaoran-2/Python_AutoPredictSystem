    <div class="field-value">In cancer there is genome-wide hypomethylation and hypermethylation of CpG islands (of tumour suppressor genes) that both contribute to genomic instability and increased rate of mutation. <br />There is usually little DNA methylation at CpG islands at the promoters of genes in a normal cell, DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with gene silencing and helps to maintain genomic stability in a normal cell. <br />In cancer cells there is hypermethylation of CpG islands specifically at the promoters of tumour suppressor genes.<br />In cancer hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes is associated with tumorigenesis and unregulated growth, since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and therefore epimutations in cancer cells will be rapidly selected. This also may result in aberrant transcription from incorrect start sites causing further genomic instability.<br />Genome wide hypermethylation in normal cells provides genomic stability and integrity by preventing illegitimate recombination between repetitive elements, preventing activation of repeats and transpositions, preventing activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.<br />There is global hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells.<br />This genome-wide hypomethylation causes genomic instability due to the activation of repeats that can replicate and transpose, disrupting coding regions and activating other genes (oncogenes). Due to the activation of usually heterochomatised and heavily methylated repeats (now hypomethylated and euchromatised) and the resultant genomic instability there are also deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations found in cancerous cells. The hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters also contributes to cancer since it can result in the activation of oncogenes (growth promoting genes). This increased genomic instability causes aberrant transcription, unregulated growth and further mutation thus contributing to cancer development.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer there can be either hypermethylation or hypomethylation at imprint control regions (ICRs) that can result in the overexpression of growth promoting genes (oncogenes) or loss of expression of growth restricting genes (tumour suppressor genes) an example of this is in the H19/Igf2 cluster. The paternal allele has a methylated imprint control region which prevents the binding of CTCF (insulator protein), stopping it from insulating Igf2 from the enhancers further upstream. This lack of CTCF insulation means that the enhancers can act of Igf2 and activate it, resulting in Igf2 expression. Methylation of the ICR spreads to H19 due to heterochromatin spread meaning H19 in silenced. The maternal allele has an unmethylated ICR that allows CTCF to bind to it. This insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers preventing the activation of Igf2 meaning there is no Igf2 expression (enhancers act on H19 instead). In Wilm's tumour there is hypermethylation of the ICRs (both maternal and paternal ICRs methylated) so CTCF can't bind and there is a double dose and therefore overexpression of Igf2, a growth promoting gene. The overexpression of Igf2 results in increased growth (since Igf2 is an oncogene) and tumorigenesis thus contributing to unregulated growth in cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is drug that is a DNA methylatransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It acts as a nucleoside analogue and binds irreversibly to the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) after it has been incorperated in to the DNA, preventing the DNMT from methylating more DNA. The inhibition of DNMTs reduces the amount of DNA methylation and therefore decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect since it reduces the hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes found in cancer, meaning they will be reactivated and prevent uncontrolled growth. This is due to DNMTi action being division dependent, since cancer cells are replicating more than normal cells they will be more severely affected by DNMTi and more DNA will be hypomethylated (only will have a beneficial effect if tumour growth is dependent on hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic drugs that alter DNA methylation in cells have effects lasting beyond the period of drug treatment since DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable epigenetic mark. Therefore any change to DNA methylation will be transferred to daughter cells in cell division. A sensitive period is when there is a period of epigenetic reprogramming, where all epigenetic marks are removed and then re-established. There are two sensitive periods and therefore two waves of epigenetic reprogramming during early development. The first wave of epigenetic reprogramming occurs in the pre-implantation embryo during early development, where there is demethylation of the maternal and paternal genomes that reaches a global low at the blastocyst stage allowing epigenetic marks to be restored according to cell lineage; the second wave occurs in primordial germ cell development. There are also sensitive periods during germ cell maturation in slow growth period of 9-12 years in males and 8-10 years in females, and in tissue specific differentiation. Treating patients in sensitive periods could alter the epigenetic marks laid down particularly in germ cell development, due to the global impacts changes in epigenetic machinery (could result in infertility) on all cells in the body (current epigenetic drugs lack specificity).</div>
