    <div class="field-value"><div>According to bio-molecular  science (research), DNA methylation, is one of the epigenetic mitotically heritable machinery acting on the chromatin, and is recognised by the addition of a methyl group at Cytosine.  Cytosine is exclusively paired with Guanine (in Mammals),  referred to as a CpG nucleotide, and in clusters are known as CpG islands,  associated with promoter regions- namely, tumour suppressor genes.  The addition of this methyl group at the Cytosine makes for an effective chemical switch,  turning genes off by interfering with transcription factors, such as binding proteins MEcP 1&amp;2, resulting with a repressive chromatin structure- namely heterochromatin.  DNA methylation  at a CpG island, is therefore,   an epigenetic mark that is silencing gene expression.  <br /><br /></div><div>However, according to research, DNA methylation is not always found at CpG islands, and in general, are normally un-methylated.  Moreover, DNA methylation is context dependent. For example, DNA methylation is the bases for X-inactivation.   But when hyper-methylated promoter genes at CpGs  are observed,  cancer is frequently implicated.  <br />DNA methylation  is therefore observed in mutations, increases in density over time as the cancer progresses- from hyper-plastic, neoplastic to  becoming most dense at the  invasion stage. Therefore, this locus specific<i> gain of methylation,</i>  at CpGs, contributes to cancer  by switching off  tumour suppressor genes.  <br /><br />Additionally, when cancer is present, the  genome-wide DNA methylation at the intergenic regions and  repetitive elements, which is normal for genome stability, <i>is  lost.</i>  Genome -wide loss of methylation, consequentially hypo-methylated, results with genomic instability, a frequent observation in cancer, identified early in the development of cancer.  Genomic instability, contributes to cancer by enhancing tumorigenesis, resulting from the abnormal karyotype  due to open chromatin- namely euchromatin, therefore abnormal access and  disruption to the gene, which should be closed- namely heterochromatin for genome stability.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div> (Blewitt, 2014, W1-L4; W7-L2,3 &amp;4 )</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According to bio-molecular  science, in a normal cell, Igf2  is paternally expressed, which means that DNA methylation is a normal mark on the paternal allele imprint control region (ICR). As a result, the  insulator protein, CTCF,  which sits between Igf2 and H19 promoter, is blocked from binding to the ICR, giving way to the downstream ‘enhancers’ to  engage and promote the expression of Igf2. This is the normal and  preferred ‘chromatin loop’ —between  ‘the enhancers’ and ‘Igf2’, furthermore, demonstrating the 'insulator model of imprinting"  The maternal allele, on the other hand, would  therefore see H19 expressed in a normal cell because  the ICR is un-methylated, thus allowing the CTCF to bind, insulating the preferred  ‘chromatin loop’   appropriately   blocking the  ‘enhancers’ from engaging and promoting Igf2.   In Wilms tumour, hyper-methylation is present, the consequence of both  the paternal and maternal  ICRs being imprinted.  In this instance,  Igf2 is being over-expressed because DNA methylation is found on both the paternal and maternal ICRs respectively.  Here the  chromatin loop is engaging and promoting  Igf2 on both alleles, hence the over-expression  Igf2— a known growth factor highly expressed in tumours, therefore promoting tumorigenesis- the creation of cancer. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, is  a DNA-Methyltransferase inhibitor, a demethylating agent that acts on the nucleoside analogues, where  it is directly taken up into DNA upon cell replication, which it is  dependent upon.  Decitabine therefore impacts upon the mitotically heritability of DNA methylation, by binding to DNMT1, which would normally restore DNA methylation  from parent to daughter strand.  From inside the cell, Decitabine becomes irreversibly bound to the DNMT1, and during normal cell division,  it’s copied from the parent to daughter cell, continually  inhibiting DNMT1. </p>
<p>Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect because it targets rapid cell division, which is a normal feature of cancer cells. Additionally, because DNA hyper-methylation is observed at the cytosine analogue- CpG tumour suppressor genes, in a variety of human cancers, but specifically in Myelodysplastic-Syndrome, the precursor to Acute Myelogenous-Leukemia.  Decitabine can therefore potentially reverse, reactivate, thus re-express the tumour suppressor gene.   </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Enduring effects on the epigenome, as a result from altering the  DNA methylation with drugs seem apparent given how the drug alters the mitotically heritable epigenetic machinery when it goes wrong in cancers.  As described at Q3. a drug such as Decitabine is incorporated into the nucleoside analogues, binding itself to DNA methlytransferase, and  copied thereafter onto the daughter strand during cell division.  For that reason, the epigenome may be  altered indefinitely, due to the drugs actions, an inhibitor degrading the DNA methlytransferase, continually altering DNA methylation, given the mitotically heritable epigenetic machinery mark in this instance.  Hence the regard for sensitive periods of development, which is when <em>active reprogramming</em> is taking place, and therefore when 'altered environments' can  have an affect on epigenetic control.   <br />There are two sensitive periods in epigenetic control, the first is   primordial germ cell development during embryonic development right through to the production of mature eggs and sperm; the second is preimplantation and early post implantation.  During these times, the active erasure and resetting of epigenetics marks can be influenced. It therefore would be inadvisable to treat patients, for example, when pregnant; or planning to get pregnant, and for a young man during his pre-puberty-years.</div>
