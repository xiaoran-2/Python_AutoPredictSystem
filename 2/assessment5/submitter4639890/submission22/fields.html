    <div class="field-value">Mutations in the DNA and/or histone-modifying enzymes leads to cancer,  <br /><br />1. The Normal function of DNA methylation is to limit a cells function i.e. for an example a muscle cell can't really secrete and produce insulin this is because of the methylation of the CPG islands close to the gene which is responsible for producing insulin.<br /><br />2. Disrupted may not be the appropriate word to use as several apoptosis genes is silenced in most cancers however it is disrupted at several oncogenes (telomerase is an example of this however telomerase is not a 100% oncogene) And the lack of methylation is due to either a mutation in DNA-methyltransferase or the Methylation promoter infact disrupted is not the right word to use at all since it actually increases within the cancerous cells.<br /><br />3. firstly we have the problem with the off-switching op the apoptosis genes. Secondly we have the problem that it removes the cancer cells functions and thirdly we have the problem that it allows the cancer cells to do things that a normal cell wouldn't be able to do, for an example there are certain cancers that produces and secretes cortisol. As well as it allows the cancerous cells to maintain a high level of mobility.<br /><br />4. The normal function of methylation in these regions is to de-promote the non coding RNA they produce even though we don't really understand their function as of yet. <br /><br />5. The methylation that is disrupted within the cancerous cells is a hyper-methylation (2 much methylation) of the intergenic regions.<br /><br />6. It helps the cancer cells to grow faster as the RNA-polymerase enzyme will be more free to work with the genes that cancerous cells wants to have expressed. By stiffling the expression of the non-coding RNA's that becomes of the intergenic regions.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Insulin like growth factor 2 helps the cancerous cells to survive and grow. By further inhibiting the apoptosis inducing proteins, and by helping the cells speed up their mitosis process. While H19 is a gene that should only be active in the gestation period outside of the muscular tissues<br /><br />1.  On the paternal allele the IGF2 gene is normally expressed much more then on the maternal alelle <br /><br />2. On the maternal allele however the IGF2 gene is normally underexpressed due to methylation of the promoter region thus causing this histone to be packed more densely around the gene.<br /><br />3. In Wilm's tumor IGF2 is overexpressed on both the maternal and paternal allele while H19 is underexpressed at both allele's <br /><br />4. Firstly we have the IGF2 which helps the cells to grow out of control and secondly we have the H19 whose product encourages the formation of cell cluster's however this gene can also be an oncogene if it is overexpressed, due to the tumor forming effects of large cell clusters. However cancerous are dependant on high mobility in order to spread and be lethal and the job of the H19 is to ensure the formation of organs in the body.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">This drug Decitabine inhibits the enzyme DNA-methyltransferase which prevents the cancer cell from silencing several genes including of course the tumor suppressor/apoptosis genes which will make the cells commit suicide if they should grow out of control.<br /><br />1. Decitabine belongs to the cytidine analogues (which means it will bind to the active site of the DNA-methyltransferase enzyme)<br /><br />2. It inhibits the DNA-methylation <br /><br />3. It will prevent the cancer cells from silencing unwanted genes. I.e. apoptosis proteins. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The drugs that alter DNA-methylation can have effects that extends beyond the treatment period because of they might bind covalently and permanent to the active side of the enzyme, and also it may be due to that the epigenetic regulation inside a cancer cell helps the genes to be spliced alternatively spliced. Or perhaps it is due to that the proteins will already have been synthesized when the drugs expires in the body. Or perhaps DNA mutations has to do with failed epigenetic regulation attempt I.e. that Cytosine becomes Thymine by de-amination, after methylation And that then results in genomic instabilty Which causes mutations.  <br /><br />And the periods where I wouldn't treat no patients with Epigenetic drugs is during periods of high stem cell differentiation or during a sensitive period.<br /><br />1. see above.<br /><br />2. A sensitive period is a period of high epigenetic activity i.e. the removal and adding of epigenetic marks in the genome.<br /><br />3. Whenever there is mitosis it is a sensitive period and also during fetal development.<br /><br />4. Because that would inhibit the epigenetic programming of all the cells that is affected by the drug. And may cause unwanted side effects <br /><br /><br /></div>
