    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">during a sensitive period of development is sufficient to induce epigenetic modifications that alter HPA activity. <span>all cells in our bodies have the same DNA, but differ by phenotype. This happens because of epigenetic marks. Different cells, express different genes. These epigenetic marks (in this case DNA methylation), are mitotically heritable, thats why muscle cells divide into other muscle cells, and not neurons. Same happens when using drug treatment that alter DNA methylation. The epigenetic marks will still be present even after cell division. The methyl groups will be passed on continuously, leaving long lasting effects in individuals. However, treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable. Sensitive periods are phases of active remodeling of the epigenome. Epigenetic marks get removed, and new epigenetic marks laid down. We have sensitive periods during germ cell development and during early development. If we alter DNA methylation during these sensitive periods, it would have a large effect on patients, leading to altered epigenomes, messed up gene expression, </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Throughout the genome, methylation tends to occur at intergenic regions (IGRs), repetitive elements, and even in introns. However, in cancer cells, the regions mentioned before become less methylated, than in normal cells. Genome-wide Hypomethylation is a common epigenetic abnormality found in almost all tumours. It happens especially at repetitive elements, enabling them to jump from one location of the genome to another, increasing the risk of reciprocal translocation between chromosomes, disrupting neighboring genes, and endangering genomic stability. In contrast to repetitive elements, intergenic regions, and introns, CpG islands in cancer become hypermethylated, thus increasing the risk of silencing the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. Hyper methylation is also a common epigenetic abnormality, which is found in almost all tumor types. <span>genome disruptions of epigenetic marks can be fatal for cells, leading to uncontrolled cell division, increased mutation rates, and genomic instability.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div> H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted genes, is located at chromosome 11 and is controlled by enhancer blocking. Since the imprinted control region of this cluster is methylated on the paternal allele, but unmethylated on the maternal allele, we can conclude that it is paternally imprinted  In this cluster, a long noncoding RNA (IncRNA) called H19, is produced at the maternal allele.</div><div>When the imprinted control region at the maternal allele is unmethylated, an insulator protein binds to it. This proteins insulates Igf2 from the enhancers, thus allowing the now free enhancers to act on H19, improving its expression.</div><div>However, if an individual suffers from an disorder where he/she has two paternal alleles, but no maternal alleles they have an increased risk of childhood rumors.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, a hypomethylating agent that allows for the re-expression of tumor suppressor genes, represents an exciting new treatment option for MDS patients. In phase 2 and 3 studies, decitabine has been associated with durable responses in MDS patients and delayed time to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation or death compared with supportive care. Decitabine has been shown to be well tolerated with a toxicity profile expected for this class of agent. Recent studies also suggest that lower dose schedules of decitabine may result in additional improvements in response. As more is learned about the mechanism of hypomethylating agents, new roles are emerging for decitabine in combination therapy for MDS and in other hematologic malignancies such as AML. <span>Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of bone marrow disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis resulting in anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia (<a>American Cancer Society 2005</a>; <a>Myelodysplastic syndromes  Foundation 2006</a>; <a>American Cancer Society 2006</a>).</span></div>
