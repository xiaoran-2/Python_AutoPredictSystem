    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">CpG Islands are usually unmethylated in a normal cell, protected from methylation, tend to be found in the 5' promoter region of regulatory genes, and general function for turning on or active gene expression. <br /><br />When CpG islands become abnormally methylated the result is transcriptional silencing of tumour suppressor genes that can lead to cancer. This type of methylated CpG island is called CIMP and is described for many different types of cancer.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in a normal cell, this tends to function for turning off or gene silencing, Methylation at intergenic region is thought to maintain genomic stability by silencing crytic transcription start sites or splice sites. <br /><br />When intergenic regions and repetitive elements become unmethylated there is gene activation at oncogene sites that also contributes to cancer. <br /><br />From this point the DNA methylation of CpG Islands and unmethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is mitotically heritable. These epimutations are also repidly selected for as these cells are resistant to death causing increasing number of cells and spreading. <br /><br />Cancer cells are generally characterized by genome wide methylation loss affecting activation of oncogenes at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, and regional gain of DNA methylation at CpG islands silencing tumour suppressor genes. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell the paternal allele is methylated at the ICR H19, leading to enhancers binding the Igf2 gene and activating expression of Igf2.<br /><br />In a normal cell the maternal allele is unmthylated at H19, leading to enhancers binding the H19 and not binding the Igf2 gene thus decreasing or silencing expression of Igf2. <br /><br />In Wilm's tumour both parental alleles are methylated as paternal alleles resulting in an overexpression of Igf2. Hypermethylation at the ICR of the maternal allele disrupts imprinting and leads to overexpression of Igf2.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs that are described as hypomethylating agents by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. As tumor cells divide Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase from methylating genes after cell division. The result is daughter tumor cells that have are unmethylated and resulting in tumor suppressing genes being turned back on. By using decitabine the epigenetic marks are being altered and the cancer cells are having their tumour surpressor genes effectively turned off. Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia</p><p><b><br /></b></p><p>.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation are altering marks that are being carried down mitotically. These methylation marks will then be passed down to all the daughter cells which will then be easier to treat because the appropriate genes for that particular tumor have been turned on or off. The sensitive periods when you do not want to alter existing epigenetic marks or interfere with the clearing and reprogramming of epigenetic marks is during development of gametes, preimplantation period, and Primordial Germ cell development. </div>
