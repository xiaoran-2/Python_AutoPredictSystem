    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>As a generalization, in normal healthy cells, DNA is hypermethylated in intergenic regions and at repetitive elements, and is hypomethylated at CpG islands.  The effect of this arrangement is that CpG islands in the normal state do not inhibit the promoter regions of their corresponding genes while repeated elements are suppressed and genomic structure is maintained.  The progression of cancer (and of normal aging) shows a reduction in methylation "genome-wide" (e.g. at intergenic regions and at repetitive elements) and an increase in methylation at CpG islands.  </span></p><p>These changes increase the chances for cancer developing in several ways, principally: 1) hypermethylated CpG islands may turn off tumor suppressor and cell-death genes that are needed for normal cell function; 2) hypomethylation of Repeats/Intergenic regions across the genome contributes to genetic instability, opening the door to oncogenic mutations; and 3) genome-wide hypomethylation may lead to demethylation of CpG poor promoters that can in turn allow activation of oncogenes that are normally suppressed.   Every instance of cancer has it's own particular genomic and epigenetic signature, which evolves over time, but the potencies of all cancers depend on the accumulation of oncogene activation and tumor suppressor deactivation, both of which are controlled to a significant degree by DNA methylation epigenetics.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal methylation pattern for the H19/Igf2 cluster is characterized by monoallelic differentiation between the paternal and maternal alleles. In the paternal allele, methylation at the imprint control region (ICR)  of the H19/Igf2 cluster blocks the binding of an insulator protein, CTCF, resulting in inactivation of the H19 gene and activation by downstream enhancers of the growth promoter gene, Igf2.  In the maternal allele, the opposite occurs: the CTCF insulator protein binds to the ICR, enabling activation of H19 by downstream enhancers and leaving Igf2 inactivated.  </p>
<p>In the childhood kidney cancer, Wilm's Disease, this normal ICR pattern in the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted resulting in the maternal allele having the same profile as the paternal allele.  The ICR regions on both alleles are hypermethylated, resulting in overexpression of the growth promoter oncogene Igf2.  This contributes to accelerated cell growth and cell division, a common element in all cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is one of four cancer therapeutic drugs currently approved by the US FDA for which the mechanism of action is to regulate  or modify the epigenetic machinery.  Decitabine is in the class of DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi) that act by reactivating tumor suppressor genes that had been epigenetically silenced by hypermethylation.  The reactivation of tumor suppressor genes serves to modify cellular phenotype away from being cancerous, such as by reversing genome-wide hypomethylation but also, possibly, by reactivating genes responsible for inducing normal programmed cell death (apoptosis).</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic markers such as DNA methylation are mitotically heritable.  Consequently, systemic administration of drugs that change the epigenome, such as the DNMTi drug class, are expected to result in an enduring rather than temporary reprogramming of the epigenome, for diseased and normal cells alike. While clinical trials have shown generally high tolerance of these agents among older cancer patients, much is unknown about the effects of widespread demethylization.<br /><br />A particular concern would be administration of epigenome modifying drugs during sensitive development periods in younger patients.  Sensitive periods include, in particular: the period of gamete development from primordial germ cells (mid-gestation embryo for females) to mature gametes (varies by gender, but effectively should be thought to include the period to the end of reproductive age); and the period of embryonic pre-implantation development.  The concern is any manipulation of the epigenome may cause harmful outcomes.  It is the equivalent to inserting untested code into a computer application that should solve one problem but may create others.</div>
