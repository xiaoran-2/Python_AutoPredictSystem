    <div class="field-value"><p> </p><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer
in two ways: Hypermethylation and hypomethylation. Hypermethylation affects CpG
islands, CpG island shores of tumour suupressor genes and Imprint Control
Regions (ICRs) leading to loss of imprinting. Hypomethylation affects
repetitive regions, CpG poor promoters and again ICRs. </p>

<p><span>Generally DNA methylation of promoter
regions leads to silencing. CpG island, which are found in the majority of the
promoters tend to remain unmethylated. Their methylation is succeeded with the
methylation of 5’ group of cytosines within the CpG dinucleotides. Normally, DNA
methylation in CpG island results in gene silencing with two mechanisms. First,
meCpG is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin
structure and second, meCpG can prohibit transcription factor
binding and alters the gene expression.</span></p>

<p>DNA methylation also occurs in
intergenic regions and repetitive elements which, unlike CpG islands tend to be
methylated. The main function of DNA methylation in these regions and elements
is to maintain genomic integrity. </p>

<p>In cancer cells, CpG islands tend to
become hypermethylated leading to the silence of tumour suppressor genes. On
the contrary, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to become
hypomethylated. </p>

<p>These aberrations in DNA methylation
usually result in overexpression to genes which in combination with the
silencing of tumour suppressors end up to the alteration of normal to cancer
cells and the formation of a tumour.</p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p><p><span>One
of the clusters in Imprint Control Regions (ICRs) is the H19/Igf2 one. The
function of the H19 long non coding RNA and the expression of the <i>Igf2</i> gene differs between the maternal
and paternal allele. </span></p>

<p><span>In
the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated. This means that an insulator
protein called CTCF can bind to it, blocking so the action of the enhancers to
the <i>Igf2</i> gene which remains silent.
On the contrary, in the paternal allele, ICR is methylated and so CTCF is not
able to bind on it. The enhancers can act to the <i>Igf2</i> gene, which is then expressed.</span></p>

<p>In
cancer cell, alterations in DNA methylation occur at ICRs resulting in the loss
of expression of growth restring genes and/or overexpression of growth
promoting genes. </p>

<p><span>An
example is shown in Wilm’s tumour cancer cells, where in both maternal and
paternal allele the ICR is methylated, a fact that leads to expression of the <i>Igf2</i> gene from both of the alleles
(over- and uncontrolled expression of the gene), and the formation of a tumour.</span></p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is an anti-cancer chemotherapy drug, used as a demethylation agent. In other
words, it is classified as one of the DNA methyltransferases inhibitors DNMTi).
These kinds of inhibitors are nucleoside analogues, which tend to be
incorporated to DNA and be replication dependent. Consequently, the cancer
cells that are replicated more rapidly, they are affected more severely. </p>

<p>The
action of DNMTi still remains unclear and it has been shown that their use in
high doses is not effective, since they become very toxic. However, when used in
much lower doses appear to have anti-neoplastic effects in cancer, at least in
some cases, because they seem to cause DNA methylation. </p><span>

<span>Decitabine has been
approved and used for the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndromes, which are the
precursors of myelogenous leukaemia</span></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p><p>Aberrations in DNA methylation can
lead to tumorigenesis. Particularly, DNA hypomethylation which occurs in
repetitive elements, CpG poor promoters and intergenic regions lead to genomic
instability, by activation of repeats and transposition, disruption of the
expression of the neighbouring genes or oncogene activation. In other words,
depletion of DNA methylation seems to enhance tumorigenesis.</p>

<p>Drugs which alter the DNA
methylation, used in cancer may have last beyond the period of drug treatment,
since DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark, which is mitotically
heritable. It is plausible then that some epigenetic therapies based on
altering the stage of DNA methylation, could stop the aberrant cell division in
cancer.</p>

<p>During the sensitive periods of
development, the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks occur. These two
periods, that is the primordial cell developmet and early embryonic
development, are very crucial. Reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during
gametogenesis and after fertilization. </p>

<p>Based on those, it is plausible that
patients who pass one of these sensitive periods should avoid cancer treatment
using drugs for DNA methylation. Such patients may be, for example, the younger
ones or those who undergo an IVF treatment for baby conception.</p><span>
