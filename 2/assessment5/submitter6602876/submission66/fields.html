    <div class="field-value"><b>In general, DNA methylation is apparently "inverted" in cancer: regions that are normally un-methylated, are methylated, and vice versa. </b> in cancer; often regions that are normally methylated  are unmethylated in cancer cells, disinhibiting tumour suppression. Specifically, to answer each question:<br /><br />(1) CpG islands, which are often found at promoter sites, are normally<i> protected </i>from methylation, which allows <i>expression</i> of the gene(s) under control of the respective promoter.<br /><br />(2) The<i> normally </i><i>unmethylated</i> CpG islands of normal cells are often found to be <i>hypermethylated </i>in cancers.This <i>silences</i> the genes under the control of the CpG islands. Research to date has identified<i> tumour suppressor genes as being silenced by this hypermethylation of CG islands in cancer</i>. [CpG island methylation  silences what ever gene the CpG island promotor is associated with..]<br /><br />(3) The hypermethylation of CpG islands, in contrast to their normal state of non-methylation, often leads to<b> silencing of tumour suppression genes, allowing the tumours to grow.</b><br /><br />(4) Normally,<i> intergenic and repetitive regions of DNA are methylated.</i> <br /><br />(5) Again, it seems from the lectures that the normal methylation pattern is disrupted, even inverted, in cancer. Intergenic and repetitive elements that are <i>normally methylated are often unmethylated or hypomethylated</i> in cancer.<br /><br />(6) This <i>aberrant pattern of methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive regions of DNA l</i>eads to several dysfunctions. One is that regions that <i>would not be translated (intergenic regions) may be translated, leading to problems</i>. Repetitive elements, by definition, have many<i> repeating nucleotide base sequences which <b>can pair in a rather random manner with any sequence that is nearly, or identically, similar</b>. </i>This leads to <b>genomic instability</b>: reciprocal translocations, deletions, insertions,chromatin changes, and areas of the chromosomes that are now are active OR repressed, and that normally would have the  opposite function, or be not involved at all.<b>Gene expression patterns are changed</b>.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a general sense,<strong> disruption of imprinting encourages overgrowth of cells, which may lead to cancer</strong>, as many of the imprinted genes in mammals are involved in growth.<br /><strong>"ICR" means "imprinting control region"</strong><br /><br />The H19/Igf2 gene cluster is schematically represented as: -<strong>[Igf2 gene]-[CTCF gene (insulator)]-[H19 ICR region]-[H19 gene]-enhancer1]-[enhancer2]-<br /><br />(1) </strong>I<strong>n the paternal allele the H19/Igf2 ICR is methylated</strong>, which <em>silences H19</em> ; the <em>CTCF gene is methylated</em>, silencing the expression of this insulator..This <em>allows the enhancers to act on the IGf2 gene</em> and IGf2 is abundantly expressed, promoting cellular growth.<br /><br />(2) <strong>In the maternal allele the ICR of H19 is not methylated, and the CTCF protein is expressed;</strong> <em>which inhibits</em> both the enhancers from acting on the Igf2 gene. Igf2 is not expressed.<br /><br />(3) In Wilm's tumour, a childhood cancer of the kidney, the<strong> normal imprinting of the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is extended to the maternal allele (ie it is methylated)</strong>,<em> leading to double expression of Igf2,</em> driving cellular growth.<br /><br />(4) The <strong>double expression of Igf2 in Wilm's tumour cells lead to overgrowth of cells, which is part of cance</strong>r. There may be additional dysfunctions in other pathways, like removal of apoptosis, that also contribute to this cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>Decitabine is approved by the FDA (USA) to treat Myelodysplasia syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloleukemia</b>. This cancer is one where too many blood cells are being produced. Decitabine is a <i>nucleotide analog, and is incorporated into DNA while  DNA replication is occurring</i>. Thus, in the diseases above,<i> where the cells are very rapidly dividing, it can be effective as a treatment</i>. It is not incorporated into RNA,(Reference:Wikipedia), and is being studied for use in other tumour types.<br />To answer the specific questions:<br /><br />(1) <b>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi)</b>. After<i> being incorporated into the DNA, it irreversibly binds to the enzyme</i>(s),<b> ending methylation of DNA at the site.</b> <br /><br />(2) <b>Decitabine induces DNA hypomethylation.<br /><br /></b>(3)  Decitabine results in <b>a reversal of the hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes,</b> <i>allowing tumour suppressor genes to activate, and stop the production of cancer cells</i>.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The article did not elaborate on the enhanced susceptibility to standard chemotherapy, nor what the standard chemotherapy was, so I can only hazard a guess to a mechanism: <strong>After treatment with the epigenetic drug, the cancer's rate of cell growth may have slowed, making it more easily killed by standard chemotherapy</strong>.<br /><br />(1) <strong>The definition of epigenetic includes mitotically inheritable</strong>: DNA methylation removal that allows tumour suppressor genes to reactivate, for example, <em>would be passed on to daughter cells and could drastically reverse the cancer phenotype towards slower growth</em>.<strong>The change could be permanent (enduring).</strong><br /><br />(2) A <strong>sensitive period is one where crucial imprinting occurs</strong>, <em>and environmental effects can have profound consequences later.</em><br /><br />(3) <strong>Two of the most important sensitive periods in mammals are when the cells first begin dividing after fertilization, and when primordial germ cells are imprinted.</strong> Other periods<em> may</em> include;oocyte development which continues as the female matures, and possibly pre-puberty in boys.<em><strong>Additionally,each organ has its own specific sensitive period for development</strong>,</em> with the brain perhaps having the slowest over all development and the longest sensitivity. There may be many sensitive periods.<br /><br />(4) <strong>Disrupting methylation</strong> <em>could erase or distort imprinting, or organ development</em> .Adults are less susceptible (somatic maintenance).</div>
