    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are normally not methylated, but in cancer cells they can be hypermethylated (too much methylation). Methylation acts to silence tumour suppressor genes that normally inhibit growth of cells. So if these genes become hypermethylated, these genes are inactivated when they shouldn't be, DNA repair is reduced and cancer cells can keep growing. <br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated, but in cancer cells they are hypomethylated (not methylated enough). Methylation of repetitive elements normally silences them and this helps to prevent potentially harmful changes to the DNA. Methylated Cytosine converts easily to Thymine, so this along with silencing of the repeats, can prevent sections of DNA being transposed or recombined to areas of the genome that they shouldn't be. The methylation of repeats also reduces the potential for strong promoters to interfere with transcription. Silencing intergenic regions with methylation may also avoid cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites causing structural changes to the DNA like insertions, deletions or translocations that can be seen in the abnormal karyotypes of cancer cells.<br /><br /><div>According to the Knudson hypothesis (Knudson, 1971), it takes 2 changes to the tumour suppressor genes for a cancer to result. Because we usually have 2 alleles for each gene, if one is already defective, (eg. genetically inherited mutation), it only takes one more mutation to mean that both copies behave abnormally, resulting in cancer. Disruption of the the normal DNA methylation can contribute to cancer by acting as the second "hit". And when the cells divide by mitosis, these epimutations are heritable, so these cells will grow at the expense of other normal cells. The cancer cells are at a selective advantage; they divide rapidly and moreover, they don't die, so they grow and unfortunately can take over normal tissues in the body.<br /><br /></div><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC389051/" title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC389051/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC389051/</a><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG methylation spreads to CpG island shores 20kb around the CpG islands; these can be imprint control regions which are often associated with growth control.<br /> <br />Maternal alleles are not normally methylated; CTCF, an insulator protein, binds to the insulator element of the imprint control region, preventing downstream enhancers from acting on Igf2. This allows the enhancers to act on H19 instead, so H19 is expressed and Igf2 is silenced, inhibiting growth.<br /><br />Paternal alleles are normally methylated. This stops CTCF from binding with the insulator element and the methylation spreads to the promotor of the H19 gene, so H19 is silenced. Enhancers preferentially act on Igf2, allowing Igf2 expression. This promotes growth in a cell; only one allele for this growth promoting gene is active when cells are normally imprinted. In this case, normally the paternal allele for H19 is silenced and Igf2 is active.<br /><br />If the imprint control region is hypermethylated, (where both the maternal and paternal alleles of the imprint control region become methylated), then both H19 alleles will be silenced. Igf2 will be expressed on both alleles, (double dose of Igf2), causing excessive growth of the kidney cells in Wilm's tumour.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are proteins that lay down and maintain methylation marks on DNA. DNMT3a and 3b are de novo transferases that methylate CpGs in mammals. When DNA is replicated during cell division, DNMT1 then maintains this methylation pattern by methylating the new single strands (which are hemimethylated DNA) to match the original strands. Hence the new double strand DNA in daughter cells will have the same methylation marks as a parent cell after cell division; methylation can be mitotically heritable.<br /><br />Decitabine is a DNA <b>demethylating agent</b> that gets incorporated into the DNA when cells are replicating (acting as a cytosine nucleoside analogue). It prevents methylation as it irreversibly binds with DNA methyl transferase (acting as a <b>DNMT inhibitor</b>). <br /><br />Because cancer cells divide so rapidly, they are more vulnerable (possibly because the CpG islands are often hypermethylated in cancer). Thus Decitabine is anti-neoplastic (inhibits the growth of tumours).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can be mitotically heritable; changes to DNA methylation could be passed on to the daughter cells when a cell divides, so potentially could affect all cells subsequently produced.<br /><br />During times of rapid growth and development, such as in utero there are <b>sensitive periods</b> during which <b>epigenetic reprogramming</b> occurs. These are periods when changes to the environment have the largest effect: during formation of germ cells (egg/sperm) and in early embryonic development.<br /><br />Drugs that affect cancer cells by altering the methylation patterns may also affect any other dividing cells in the body. For a younger person, cells that are undergoing or may in future undergo mitosis or meiosis, would be vulnerable. For example, if a woman was exposed to a particular drug in very early pregnancy, the cells of her embryo may be affected, but also the germ cells within that embryo. Thus her child and the future potential grandchildren may also be affected.<br /><br />At this stage scientists do not fully understand what proportion of a person's genome and which people are sensitive to these drugs; also it is not clear what percentage of these changes are heritable both mitotically and/or meiotically. </div>
