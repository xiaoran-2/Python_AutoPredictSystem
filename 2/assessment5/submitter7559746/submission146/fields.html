    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cel the <b>CpG islands</b> are protected from methylation so the gene can be transcribed. Methylation of a CpG Island results in gene silencing by creating a repressive chromatine structure and prohibiting TF from binding. In a cancer cel the CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes are methylated resulting in silencing which leads to underexpression of this polypeptide resulting in abnormal cell growth. </p><p><b>Intergenic regions</b> are methylated in normal cells which maintains genomic integrity by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. <b>Repetitive elements</b> are also methylated in normal cells which maintains genomic integrity by preventing transposition and illegitimate recombination. In cancer the Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated resulting in genomic instability. Heterochromatin is transformed in euchromatin permitting illegitimate recombination, deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations and activation of repeats and transposition. on CpG poor promotors this hypomethylation results in oncogene activation. (course notes). </p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is parent of origin specific gene expression by clustered genes, each cluster has it's own ICR and mechnism of action. H19/Igf2 works by enhancer blocking of CTCF, a protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. DNA methylation at the ICR bindingsite blocks CTCF binding. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promotor to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate. This is paternaly imprinted. The <b>maternal allele</b> is unmethylated, CTCF binds and the enhancers activate H19. The <b>paternal allele</b> is methylated the methylation spreads to the ICR and the enhancers can acces Igf2. This is chromatine looping. The preferred loop is between enhancers and Igf 2, when CTCF blocks this the secondary mechanism is H19. </p><p>Loss of imprinting of Igf2 is linked to reduced expression and abnormal methylation of <i>H19</i> in Wilms' tumour (M. Steenman, nature genetics 7) Igf2 is an oncogene that promotes growth. If this is overexpressed, like in <b>Wilms' tumor</b>, when the maternal allele acts like a paternal allele, there will be fetal and postnatal overgrowh and it results in a predisposition to childhood but not adult tumors (course notes). </p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a <b>DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) inhibitor</b>. It is a nucleoside analogue and gets incorporeted into the DNA upon replication. When DNMT1 comes along to bind to copy the DNA methylation to the daughter strand the DNMT is bound irreversibly and can no longer be released (coursera video). This proces <b>prevents DNA methylation </b>in daughter cells at CpG islands. Since some haematological malignancies are dependant on hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes Decitabine might slow down the growth in these tumors. Since this proccess needs cel replication it affects cancer cells more then normal cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is one of the specific epigenetic modifications made to the genome to turn on or switches off gene expression. This turned on/off state can be <b>passed on mitoticaly</b> and will be present in all daughter cells. If the methylation is altered (by drugs or otherwhise) it is altered in all the cell's offspring. <br />DNA methylation is one of the mechanisms in <b>epigenetic reprogramming </b>and<b> genomic imprinting</b> that happens in the 2 <b>sensitive periods:</b><b> early embrionic environment </b>and <b>PGC development. </b>During a <b>sensitive period </b>epigenetic clearing takes place and the genetic marks are reprogrammed for the future generation. <br />If you would treat a patient in a sensitive period, the epigenetic reprogramming which depends on DNA methylation would be disturbed and genetic abnormalities might occur due to incorrect methylated genes resuting in abnormal gene expression patterns which would have longterm effects as it would affect all daughter cells. <br /><br /></div>
