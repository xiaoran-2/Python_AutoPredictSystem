    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation was found to be one of the contributing factor to the accumulation of the many genetic and epigenetic abnormalities that lead to cancer. In the normal state, CpG islands  which are usually located at the promoter region of genes are unmethylated which allow the gene it is associated with to be expressed. However, in the cancer, the CpG islands become hypermethylated which causes silencing of genes especially the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. The disruption of the normal unmethylated state of the CpG island to a hypermethylated state contributes to cancer as one of the many hits in the DNA as part of the Knudson hypothesis to cancer. It is also another route by which tumor suppressor genes can be silenced besides genetic mutation thus the uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells. The daughter cells of cancer also carry the same hypermethylated state since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and the epigenetic mutation are rapidly selected for further tumorigenesis. <br />There is also the observed abnormal genome wide hypomethylation in the cancer. In normal cells, the CpG sites at repetitive regions and intergenic regions are methylated in order to maintain genomic stability. However in cancer cells, these sites become hypomethylated and leads to genomic instability by illegitimate recombinations between repeat regions, activation of repeats and their transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and the disruption of neighboring genes. The result of genomic instability is abnormal cancer karyotype which has chromosomal deletions, insertions and translocations. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The disruption of imprinting at can result to loss of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes which are contributing cancer factors and this commonly occurs in pre-neoplastic tissue. In the case of normal H19/IgF2 cluster, the gene IgF2 is expressed only in the paternal allele because the ICR (imprint control region) at this allele has imprinted methylation and it blocks the binding of the CTCF protein. Without the CTCF, the DNA methylation spreads towards the H19 RNA promoter which is silenced and allows the downstream enhancers to activate expression of IgF2. The normal maternal allele is silenced by the presence of the binding of CTCF on the ICR in the cluster because it is unmethylated, the presence of the CTCF at the site will prevent the interaction of the enhancers and IgF2 thereby silencing its expression.<br />In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele has abnormal hypermethylation at the ICR, in this case both alleles are expressed because the CTCF cannot bind unto the ICRs and stop the enhancers from activating the IgF2. This means there is double dose of IgF2 in the cells, since IgF2 is a growth promoting gene would result to tumorigenesis.<br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. This type of inhibitor incorporates to the DNA during replication and irreversibly binds to DNMT, stopping its methylation activity towards the other areas of the DNA. The inhibition of DNMT activity would lower the methylation level of hypermethylated DNA, allowing the expression of previously silenced tumor suppressor genes. The drug would also be able to slow down or even stop the progress of hypermethylation dependent tumorigenesis by passing the new unmethylated state to the next generation of daughter cells by mitotic heritability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic drugs which target DNA methylation enzymes like DNMT can have enduring effects on epigenome because once the epigenetic marks such as abnormal hypermethylation is erased, the resulting unmethylated state will be passed on to the next daughter cells due to mitotic heritability, and may contribute to cancer cells vulnerability to standard chemotherapy. However, the use of epigenetic drugs should be done with caution as epigenetic marks are integral for cell differentiation, gene expression and silencing and higher chromosome order.  It is very important for normal growth that epigenetic marks are cleared during the sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming, in early embryo and primordial germ cell development. Disruption of the normal epigenetic reprogramming by an epigenetic drug during the sensitive stage would cause severe damage to important imprinted genes responsible for cell differentiation and growth.  It can also cause a genome wide hypomethylation which causes genomic instability also leading to cancer. It would be inadvisable to treat young patients and pregnant mothers with these type of drugs because they are at the sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming and primordial cell development and would only worsen their cancer prognosis rather than help them. </div>
