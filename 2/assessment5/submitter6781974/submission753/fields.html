<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA
methylation is changed and often inverted compared with the situation in a
normal cell. But because epigenetic marks are reversible it is possible to
design drugs which alter the epigenetic state and by this cure cancer.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">CpG-island
hypermethylation in cancer: Normal</span><span lang="en-au" xml:lang="en-au">l</span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">y, CpG-islands
are unmethylated but in cancer cells they are often methylated. This
methylation of CpG-islands progresses with time. The CpG-islands are found in
the promoters of tumor suppressor genes and if they are methylated they are
inactive, so the tumor suppressor genes are down-regulated.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Hypomethylation
in the ´rest´ of the genome (intergenic regions and repetitive elements): In
contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal
cells and unmethylated in cancer cells. The unmethylated intergenic regions and
repetitive elements are active which causes genomic instability by jumping
around of repeats or recombination between chromosomes. It is also possible
that oncogenes are activated because of this hypomethylation and they are no longer silenced.<br /></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because of
cancer there can be changes in the DNA methylation at imprinting control
regions (ICR). This can be hyper- or hypomethylation. That means a loss of
imprinting and the genes are either expressed from both alleles (growth
promoting genes) or silenced on both alleles (growth restricting genes) and
this leads to cancer. The most imprinted genes are involved in growth. </p>

<p>In a normal
cell the ICR of the paternal allele is methylated and the enhancers can bind to
Igf2 and it is expressed. The ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated and
the enhancers activate the expression of H19 and the Igf2 will be
silenced.</p>

<p>In case of
the H19/Igf2 cluster it is hypermethylation of the ICR that causes cancer, the
so-called Wilm´s tumour. The ICR of both alleles is methylated and thus the
Igf2 is active on both alleles whereat the H19 is silenced twice. That results
in a dose of the growth promoting factor Igf2 twice as high as normal and this
leads to childhood kidney cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine
belongs to the group of DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor). Drugs like
Decitabine are DNA-demethylating agents, so they prevent the methylation of the
DNA by binding the DNA methyltransferase irreversibly. These
epigenetic marks are passed on to the daughter cells until they are actively
removed. Once they are erased they do not come back and the cancer is cured/
beaten. So changing the methylation marks is a very effective way to treat
cancer.</span><span> These DNMTi are dependent on replication because
the binding of the DNA methyltransferase takes place during the duplication of
DNA in the cell cycle. Cancer cells replicate themselves faster and so they are
more prone to be unmethylated.</span> In cancer cells the tumour suppressor genes are methylated and inactive but with these DNMTi they are reactivated and can ´fight´ against the cancer cells.<br /></p><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The
epigenetic marks are set and are inherited to the next generation of cells
(daughter cells). Unless they are actively changed or erased they stay the
same. Through these drugs the methylation-marks are changed/removed and
accordingly inherited (passed on to the daughter cells). But there are some
sensitive periods during development. You will find these sensitive periods of
reprogramming during pre-implantation period (early development) and primordial
germ cell development. In these periods the epigenetic marks are removed and
reset. If there are any changes in the environment they will have a very great
impact on the epigenome. Normally, it is really important that these marks are
reset correctly. But with these drugs the DNA is demethylated and so the marks
are gone. This can have really negative effects on the offspring because the
epigenetic marks are set differently.  So
if a woman is pregnant or if the patient wants to have a baby it is inadvisable
to use that kind of drugs because they alter the epigenome of the unborn child which is in a sensitive period during the development in the mother.<br /></span></p>
