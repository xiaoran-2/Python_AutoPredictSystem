    <h1>Submission 167 from Anon (session_user_id: 1babc1bf5ef534b949df441ad3bd972f814a6470)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia it´s a histone-deacetylase inhibitors.Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent<u>.</u> It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase<u>.</u><span> Experimentally, high doses induce rapid DNA damage and cytotoxicity.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the transfer of methyl groups (-CH3) to cytosine some bases (C) of DNA located upon and adjacent to a guanine (G). These CpG islands are regions between 0.5 and 5.5 kb containing CG dinucleotides at least 55% (assume 1% of the genome and are usually not methylated). Are particularly concentrated in the promoter region of the genes. Promoters are specific DNA sequences located at the 5'-terminal ends of the gene and contains the information necessary to enable or disable the gene it regulates. RNA polymerase binds to the sequences of such promoters initiating transcription process.<br />In Cancer , Malignant cells are accompanied by an overall hypomethylation is associated with the activation of genes required for invasion and metastasis, via oncogenetics-(quantization techniques of methylation) and a local hypermethylation (CpG islands) related to the suppression of tumor suppressor genes suppressing-path-(techniques for the detection of certain genes CpG)<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The absence of any DNA methylation on the silent <i>Igf2</i><span> gene forced us to consider alternative models to explain its imprinting. In fact, it is the expressed paternal allele of </span><i>Igf2</i><span> that is specifically methylated in two locations: within the gene itself and in its 5′ flank </span><span>. Furthermore, this correlation between methylation and expression of </span><i>Igf2</i>extends to the choroid plexus, a tissue that expresses both alleles of<i>Igf2</i><span> and exhibits biallelic methylation</span>, and to mutations at<i>H19</i><span> that activate </span><i>Igf2</i> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is a particularly attractive form of regulation to target in treatments because it can be manipulated once, and enduring effects are ensured as the DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis. However, these global interventions may interfere with ordinary functioning of the system, especially during critical periods ­­ periods of time where extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs. In particular, it would be inadvisable to prescribe these treatments to pregnant mothers (including a few months before conception) as a lot of reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the formation of gametes (both male and female) </div></div>
