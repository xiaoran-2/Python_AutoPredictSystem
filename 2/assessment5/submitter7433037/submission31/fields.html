    <div class="field-value"><p>To enable <b>normal tissue-specific gene expression</b>, the <b>CpG islands </b>(CGIs) in these gene </p><p>promoter regions, are usually <b>kept free of DNA methylation</b>.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In this epigenetic imprinting on the H19/Igf2 cluster, we have the additional entities involved in this process. These are the Enhancers down stream, CTCF an insulator protein and ICR the imprint control region. </p><p>  </p><p>On the maternal allele, CTCF can bind to the unmethylated ICR. This results in the blockage </p><p>of the Igf2 gene from the Enhancers. So the DNA methylation spreads to ncRNA H19. So H19 is </p><p>silenced. </p><p>   </p><p>On the paternal allele CTCF insulator protein cannot bind to the methylated ICR. <br />So the Igf2 allele on the paternal autosome is not blocked from its Enhancer. So the down </p><p>stream Enhancer can access Igf2 to activate and express it. Therefore Igf2 is not </p><p>methylated.  </p><p>   </p><p>Because of DNA methylation spreading in the cluster, H19 on the paternal allele and Igf2 on </p><p>the maternal allele also become methylated and hence silenced.</p><p>    </p><p>Imprinting in the H19/Igf2 cluster can be disrupted by a mutation in ICR.</p><p>    </p><p>Should this happen, the previously described ICR blockage on the maternal autosome will </p><p>open up, resulting in Enhancer access to the maternal Igf2 allele and its consequent </p><p>activation.</p><p>   </p><p>So now we have overexpression of Igf2, growth-promoting gene from both maternal and </p><p>paternal alleles contributing to Wilm’s tumour cancer.</p><p>    </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value"><b></b>FDA approved Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that is a DNMT inhibitor and also a chemotherapy agent and used in treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia.<br />  <br />DNA methylation regulates gene expression in cells. When there is an increase in this methylation it can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth. When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer.<br /><br />Decitabine works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. This demethylation process restores normal function to the tumor suppressor genes, thus restoring control over cell growth.<br />  <br />Decitabine also a chemotherapy agent called antimetabolites. When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine.<br />   <br />Reference:<br /><a title="Link: http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx" href="http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx">http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx</a><br /><a title="Link: http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01262" href="http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01262">http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01262</a><br /><a title="Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine</a><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In non-cancerous cells there would be active tumour suppressing genes that would prevent the growth of tumours in these cells. The epigenome would therefore need to provide a DNA hypomethylation on the promoter of these genes to retain their active state, whilst maintaining an internal equilibrium on the whole genome. DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent cell generations and in combination with constraints of internal epigenome coherence, the methylation is enduring.</p><p>  </p><p>In cancerous cells the promoter of tumour suppressing genes is hypermethylated so that the    tumour suppressing genes are silenced and tumours can proliferate.  As indicated in question 3, epigenetic drugs can alter hypermethylation to hypomethylation so that tumour suppression genes are active again and progressively target and eliminate the cancer cells and replace them with normal cells that would mitotically be passed on to subsequent cell generations.</p><p>  </p><p>So the altered DNA methylation is again enduring as indicated above and would last beyond the period of drug treatment.</p><p>  </p><p>A sensitive period is when epigenetic programming or reprogramming is carried out.</p><p>  </p><p>Early embryonic and primordial germ cell developments are sensitive periods.</p><p>  </p><p>Medical and IVF treatment of patients may interfere with epigenetic programming. </p><p>  </p></div>
