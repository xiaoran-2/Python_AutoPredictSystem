    <div class="field-value"><p><b><u>DNA methylation</u></b><u> </u><u><span>is addition of </span>methyl group</u><u> </u><u>to the cytosine DNA nucleotide</u><u><span>. </span></u><u><span>Methylation
mostly occurs at the C-5 position of the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides and
plays important roles in gene activity, transposon silencing, genomic
imprinting, embryonic development, aging, differentiation and carcinogenesis.

methylation is essential during embryonic development, and patterns of DNA
methylation are generally transmitted to daughter cells with high accuracy. </u><u>The resulting change is normally permanent.</u><u> Genes with high levels of 5-methylcytosine</u><u> in their promoter <a title="Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"></a></u><u> region are transcriptionally silent.</u></p>

<p><u><span>Genome in general is methylated in their
repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and in the introns of genes.
Human repetitive elements make up more than half of the human genome and
contain approximately 52% of all CpG dinucleotides in the human genome. In
adult cells, human REs are generally highly methylated and this status is
associated with maintenance of chromosome structure and genome integrity.  </span></u></p>

<p><u>In contrast, in cancer cell, the CpG
islands are more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell. </u><u>Hypermethylation and hypomethylation
compared to normal tissue have been associated with a large number of human malignancies.
Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and
progression of cancer through different mechanisms.<a title="Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation#cite_note-CraigJMWongNC-18" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation#cite_note-CraigJMWongNC-18">.</a></u><u> </u><u></u></p>

<p><u>There
is hypermethylation of tumor suppressor </u><u> genes and hypomethylation of oncogenes</u><u>. </u><u>Cancer involves activation of
oncogenes, that are involved in growth promotion. </u><u>A
cancer cell may inherit DNA methylation mitotically or it may happen
epigenetically that inactivates the tumor suppressor genes. As multiple hits
are required for cancer to occur that takes out both copies of the tumor
suppressor genes and it also activate an oncogene, so that the cell rather ending
up dying, will go on to form a tumor. </u></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>

<p>If
the embryo is a male, then there is methylation of the paternally imprinted
locus, but no methylation of the maternally imprinted locus. <span>In humans, several genes are imprinted and expressed monoallelically.
 IGF2 and H19, are oppositely imprinted such
that IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele while H19 is expressed only from
the maternal allele.IGF2 is an embryonal growth factor.</span></p>

<p> Cancer cells display loss of imprinting. Their genes
no longer show imprint of expression but rather express both parental alleles
or are silent from both parental alleles. We can have either of hypermethylation
or hypomethylation in imprint control regions. </p>

<p><span>The IGF2 H19<b> </b>cluster
is methylated on the paternal allele, and it's unmethylated <b>on</b> the maternal allele. When it's
unmethylated CTCF binds its insulator element, and the enhancers act on H19. On the
paternal </span><span><span>methylated </span>allele, the enhancers act on IGF2,
because CTCF is not binding to inhibit this, and IGF2 is expressed from the
paternal allele. However, with loss of imprinting and having hypermethylation
of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. Maternal allele,
express Igf2 to double the dose of Igf2<b> </b>which<b> </b>promote growth and is associated with
Wilm's tumour. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating  drug that inhibits DNA
methylation and it can reactivate tumor suppressor genes silenced by aberrant
DNA methylation. The
DNMT inhibitors that are currently marketed include Decitabine. It is a
cytidine analog that is phosphorylated after entering cells and are
incorporated into DNA strands. This phosphorylation is brought about by
deoxycytidine kinase to it monophosphate form and by other kinases to its
triphosphate form, which is then incorporated into DNA by DNA polymerase. The
inhibition of DNA methylation is due to formation of a covalent complex between
Decitabine and DNA methyl transferase (DNMT1) at CpG methylation sites,
resulting in inactivation of this enzyme. Regions of DNA containing these
non-natural cytidine analogs form stable complexes with DNMTs and trap
sufficient enzyme to decrease overall methylation of CpG islands. DNMT1
inhibition results in DNA hypomethylation, gene activation and the induction of
cellular differences, senescence and or apoptosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;color:#000000;background:#FFFFFF;">Epigenetic processes
are essential to many functions. If they occur improperly, there can be major
adverse health effects. Imprinting describes where one of the two alleles of a
typical gene pair is silenced by an epigenetic process by methylation. This
becomes a problem if the expressed allele is damaged or contains a variant that
increases the organism’s vulnerability to microbes, toxic agents, etc. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">The sensitive period is when epigenetic imprinting takes
place. Class of genes called the imprinted genes is programmed between
generations. This wipes off the marks that were laid out in the somatic cells to
ensure totipotency in the subsequent generations. The first phase of epigenetic
reprogramming are during preimplantation development and the second is during
primordial germ cell development. After this point, much of the DNA methylation
and the histone marks throughout the genome are removed and resetting of
epigenetic marks happens in a cell type specific manner. The primordial germ
cells go on to become the germ cells, either the egg or the sperm.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">The effect of DNMT inhibitors is on the replicating cells,
cancer cells greater than other cells in the body. .
