    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands  are protected from methylation. CpG islands are found at the promoters of genes, such as tumor suppressors. Methylation of CpG islands leads to the silencing of gene expression<br />In cancer cells CpG islands  are hypermethylated.<br />The hypermethylation of DNA at CpG islands could contribute to cancer by inactivating  or silencing tumor suppressor genes, thus allowing cancer cells to grow unchecked. .<br />The normal function of DNA methylation is to methylate intergenic regions and repetitive elements, thus silencing them. . This enhances genomic integrity by preventing transposition, illegitimate recombination, and transcriptional interference from strong promoters.<br />In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements whose DNA is  normally methylated are unmethylated or hypomethylated. <br />The disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to cancer by activating oncogenes, activating genes that promote angiogenesis and metastasis, and activating transposons that will increase genomic instability and mutations. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele is methylated at the imprinting control region (ICR) and the H19 promoter. Paternal Igf2 is expressed and paternal  H19 is not expressed in normal cells.<br />Because the paternal  ICR is methylated, it cannot bind the ICR binding protein (CTCF).. The methylated H19 promoter cannot be transcribed.  As a result, the Igf2 enhancer activates  Igf2 gene expression on the paternal allele under normal circumstances..<br />The maternal allele is unmethylated, so the H19 gene is activated by the enhancer, and CTCF binds to the ICR, and the maternal Igf2 allele is not transcribed in normal cells.<br />In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele is methylated too, so maternal H19 is turned off and Igf2 is turned on.<br />The disrupted imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancers because now both the maternal and paternal Igf2 alleles are expressed. Igf2 has been associated with many cancers, and its overexpression due to the disrupted imprinting contributes to cancer development.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating drug. <br />According to Uptodate,  decitabine is phosphorylated and then  incorporated into DNA, where it  inhibits DNA methyltransferase which causes hypomethylation and leads to subsequent cell death (within the S-phase of the cell cycle).<div><br /></div>Decitabine decreases the amount of DNA that is methylated. In cancer, tumor suppressor genes are methylated which silences them. By demethylating tumor suppressor genes, and allowing their expression, decitabine could have an anti-tumor effect. <br /><br />In addition, decitabine could induce cell death because DNA methylation is essential for viability and in week one we learned that DNMT knockouts die in utero. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can either activate or inactivate genes.This effect would be permanent and last beyond the period of drug activity.<br />Increasing DNA methylation can silence repetitive elements  that disrupt the genome's integrity.<br /> It could also silence genes involved in metastasis or angiogenesis. <br />Decreasing DNA methylation at CpG islands could activate tumour suppressor genes. <br /><br />Sensitive periods of development are periods when epigenetic marks such as methylation are reprogrammed,first  removed and then added. X chromosome inactivation happens during sensitive periods<br /><br />Two such sensitive periods occur during early development. <br />From the fertilized egg stage to the blastocyst stage, first the paternal genome and then the maternal genome is demethylated. <br />Then from the blastocyst to the epiblast stage the genome is remethylated. <br />A second sensitive period is during primordial germ cell and germ cell development, when the genome is  first demethylated and then remethylated.<br /><br />Treatment of patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as it could lead to severe side effects and interfere with normal epigenetic programming that is essential to normal development. </div>
