    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression
by adding methyl groups to cytosine nucleotides, which is laid down by DNA
methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes. It can occur at CpG-islands, leading to
silencing of gene expression, and at intergenic regions, or repetitive
elements. </p>

<p>DNA methylation is vital for healthy cell growth and functioning.
Abnormalities in DNA methylation, such as Locus specific DNA hypermethylation,
or Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, are linked to cancer and were found to
progress with tumorogenicity.</p>

<p>Locus specific DNA hypermethylation can either occur at CpG-islands and
CpG-island shores, or at imprinting control regions (ICRs). </p>

<p>In general, CpG-islands are found at the promoters of tumor-supressor
genes. In normal cells, CpG-islands are hypomethylated so that the
tumor-supressor genes can be expressed. In cancer cells, CpG-islands were seen to be hypermethylated. Thus, CpG-island
hypermethylation leads to silencing of tumor-supressor genes, and this way it allows tumor cells to survive and proliferate. This is how it contributes to cancer.<br /></p><p>Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation can occur at repetitive regions, CpG poor
promoters and ICRs.<br /></p><p>In normal cells, repeats and intergenic regions are methylated i.e.
silenced in order to maintain genomic stability and prevent the genome from
illegitimate recombination to occur. Normally repetitive elements are heterochromatinized, since illegitimate recombination is only
possible in open chromatin (euchromatin). 

</p><p>In cancer cells, repetitive elements are found to be hypomethylated, which
leads to illegitimate recombination between repeats. </p>

<p>When repeats are hypomethylated i.e not silenced, these identical
elements can align and cause recombination to occur. Hypomethylated repeats can
also be activated and transpose throughout the genome, i.e. jump into the
coding region of a gene disrupting its coding sequence. Hypomethylation of the
repeats also may activate neighboring genes. Thus, hypomethylation of the
repeats contributes to cancer by causing transcriptional aberrations in the surrounding regions. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic
imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism that maintains parent-specific
monoallelic gene expression. Imprinting is associated with DNA methylation at
the imprinting control regions (ICRs).</p>

<p><span>A lot of
imprinted genes are involved in growth – either in growth promotion or
suppression.  </span></p>

<p>In the
H19/Igf2 cluster the ICR is hypermethylated on the paternal allele, which blocks
insulator protein CTCF from binding to the ICR. Without CTCF, DNA methylation
spreads to H19 promoter to silence, which allows the down-stream enhancers to
access Igf2 to activate. Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele, i.e. it is
paternally imprinted.</p>

<p>On the
maternal allele the ICR is hypomethylated which allows binding of CTCF to the
ICR, and CTCF insulates Igf2 from the down-stream enhancers. Therefore, Igf2 is
not expressed from the maternal allele.</p>

<p>In Wilm’s
tumour, both the maternal and the paternal alleles of the H19/Igf2 cluster are
hypermethylated, which prevents CTCF from binding to the ICR allowing
down-stream enhancers to activate expression of Igf2. Hence, Igf2 is expressed
from both alleles.</p>

<p>Disrupted
imprinting in Wilm’s tumour causes overexpression of growth promoting gene Igf2,
so it leads to abnormal cell growth and can promote tumorgenesis, therefore it
is one of the factors that lead to cancer. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug that belongs to a class of DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi).<br /><br />This drug demethylates (hypomethylates) DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT).<br />Decitabine targets DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA and binds them irreversibly so that the DNMTs can no longer be released. <br /><br />The action of Decitabine is replication-dependend, and as cells replicate the DNA methylation reduces.<br />Decitabine has to be used in very low doses so that it can result in DNA demethylation. <br />It is effective in treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, probably because it might be dependent on CpG-island hypermethylation. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic state that is maintained during cell division by DNMT1, i.e. it is mitotically heritable.<br />Once the DNA methylation state is altered, it will be passed on to next generations during mitosis.<br /><br />Action of drugs that alter DNA methylation is replication-dependent, so with each replication every next 
generation of cells will get the altered DNA methylation state.<br /><br />However, it is important to avoid using such drugs in sensitive periods. <br />Sensitive
 period can be described as aa period when epigenome is most vulnerable to environmental 
changes, which occurs during epigenetic reprogramming, i.e. period when 
epigenetic marks are being established, cleared or reset.<br /><br />Such 
periods are primordial germ cell development and early embryonic 
development (pre-implantation, early post-implantation and 
periconceptional periods). <br /><br />It would be inadvisable to treat with
 such kind of drugs patients in above-mentioned sensitive periods, 
particularly pregnant mothers as in this period the epigenetic marks undergo extensive epigenetic reprogramming and are 
being only established as well as children during 
formation of the gametes..<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
