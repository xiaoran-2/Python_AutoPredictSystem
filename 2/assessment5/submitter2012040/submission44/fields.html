    <div class="field-value">CpG islands promote the expression of genes. If they are methylated their  linked genes do not express. These genes can silence tumor supression genes. If these genes are inhibited the whole cell replication can become uninhibited. In cancer some CpG islands can be hypermehylated.  This can be linked with the absence of regulation in cell growth and replication. Since the methylation can be mitotically  inherited, this fact could produce accumulation of errors that can eventually drive to malignancy. Epigenetic abnormalities can be an advantage of the malignant cells over their normal neighbourhood cells,   so they can be selected and proliferate even more. <br /><br />The main difference between epigenetic and genetic mutations affecting critical regions of genome is the reversibility of the epigenetic ones. Epigenetic hypermethylation seems to be at least partly specific for each type of tumor. DNA methylation can be evaluated in the whole genome. Also  hypermethylated evaluation can be used as biomarkers to check different properties of tumors. Hypermethylated islands  can also affect regions surrounding them<br /><br />On the other side, normal cells use methylation to avoid the expression of intergenic and repetitive regions. In cancer these regions are often unmethylated. When  regions (intergenic and repetitive) are methylated, they give stability to the whole genome.  If they are unmethylated, this can produce deletion, translocations or insertions due to misalignment and loss of packaging of DNA . Hypomethylated repetitive regions can act as transposomes.   Hypomethylation is very common in tumors, it happens early in tumors and progresses with time. Hypomethylation of repetitive regions can also act as promoters. Regions of low density GpC  can become active and activate related genes.<br /><br />Since we have mechanisms linked to hypo and hypermethylation, therapy can be addressed to one mechanisms or the other. It seems that one of these mechanisms predominate. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Cancer cells can show loss of imprinting by expressing or silencing paternal and maternal alleles simultaneously. Since imprinting genes are often involved in promoting of limiting growth they can be often affected by cancer. Hyper and hypo methylation can occur . <br /><br />In normal cells, imprinting Igf2 region is methylated at the paternal allele and unmethylated at the maternal allele. If the maternal allele unmethylated  enhancers active H19 and the expression of Igf2 which will be silenced. In the paternal allele Imprinting region is methylated and H19 is methylated too. So the enhancers act on Igf2 allowing their expression. The net result is that only one copy of Igf2 is expressed. <br /><br />If you have both alleles methylated (maternal and paternal) Igf2 is over-expressed  (double dose of Igf2). Igf is a growth promoting gene associated with Wilm's tumor.<br /><br />These modifications can be seen in pre neoplastic tissue so it is an early mechanism that promotes tumor appearance. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It inhibites DNA MTase. <br /><br />Source <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520204">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520204</a><br />Decitabine (5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine or 5-Aza-Cdr) is a cytosine analogue  that at low doses,  induced differentiation by reversing DNA methylation-induced gene silencing. It promotes cellular 
differentiation by reversing epigenetic suppression of genes, and has 
shown efficacy in producing remissions lasting several months in a 
subset of elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.<br /><br />In summary it is an agent that eliminates methylation of genes involved in tumor growth. Since the DNA methyl transferase is involved in maintaining the methylation of the unmethylated allele after the replication in few divisions the methylation associated with the expression of the tumor clears. In this way cell differentiation can reappear.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome since it is mitotically inheritable. In this way a methylation of a region can be transmitted to its descending cells. <br /><br />Epigenetic reprogramming happens in early development and in primordial germ cell development. In these periods epigenetic alterations can be produced since the mechanisms of epigenetic modification are active. Every mechanism altering normal epigenetic reprogramming can act more intensely in these periods. Carencial states can modify methylation and also drugs altering DNA methylation can have permanent effects. <br /><br /><br /></div>
