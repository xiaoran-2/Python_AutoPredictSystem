    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of DNA segments contributes to the silencing of
the affected genes.  CpG islands in DNA often
occur in the promoters of tumor- suppressing genes. In normal chromosomes these
islands are not very methylated, allowing those genes to be expressed to
fulfill their function of keeping the number of tumor cells low. In cancer,
those CpG islands become methylated to a far greater degree, that is,  hypermethylated, which silences the
tumor-suppressing genes from generating the necessary proteins and which allows
the growth and mitotic replication of cancer cells.</p>

<p>In contrast to the normally lightly methylated CpG islands,
much of the rest of the genome, particularly the stretches between the genes,
the intergenic regions, and even more so, the repetitive elements, are heavily
methylated in normal DNA. This helps maintain genomic stability because it
prevents illegitimate reciprocal chromosomal recombinations and aberrant
numbers of repetitive elements. In cancerous cells these regions become
undermethylated (hypomethylated) allowing the aberrant chromosomal
recombinations and repetitive elements to proliferate in cells that mitotically
replicate and thus the cancer grows.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since many imprinted genes are involved in the growth
process, either enhancing or restricting it, aberrant gene expression can
result in abnormal cell replication rates. Imprinting is regulated by Imprint
Control Regions (ICRs) in the DNA. Loss of imprinting as a result of ICR aberrant
methylation can result in tumor growths, 
and depending on the ICR for specific genes,  can be a result of either the hyper-  or hypomethylation of the ICR(s) in question.</p><p>As an example, in the normal cell the ICR at the relevant locus
for IGF2 in the paternal allele is methylated while it is unmethylated in the
maternal allele. The CTCF insulator binds to unmethylated regions, silencing
IGF2 expression. Therefore, in the in the normal cell only the paternal allele expresses  IGF2 while the maternal allele is silent.
However, if the relevant ICR in the maternal allele also becomes methylated,
disrupting the imprinting, thus not allowing the binding of CTCF, then the
maternal allele will also express IGF2, resulting in a double dose of a growth
enhancing gene which can give rise to tumors. 
An abnormality known as Wilm’s tumor.</p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Enzyme EZH2 attaches methyl groups to the DNA histone
proteins. Certain mutations in EZH2 cause that enzyme to become overactive and to
hypermethylate the histone which, in turn, silences the expression of tumor
suppressor genes, allowing tumors to develop and grow unregulated. Decitabine
is member of a DNA demethylating class of drugs whose objective it is to reduce
the histone’s hypermethylation.  Decreased methylation reduces the silencing of
the tumor-suppressor genes and with more of these genes expressed tumor growth
is more highly regulated and reduced.</p><p>Reference:   Cancer's Epicentre, The Economist, April 7, 2012</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>

<p>Reprogramming DNA methylation epigenetically results in
mitotically inherited epigenetic marks in the chromosome structure. Care needs
to be exercised to avoid such treatment, however, if an embryo in the
blastocyst or primordial cell development stages, the “sensitive” periods, is or
can be present. During these stages epigenetic reprogramming of DNA methylation
occurs and interference of that reprogramming with DNA demethylating treatments
can have unforeseen and drastic results. Such treatments should be limited to the
somatic maintenance phase when the epigenetic reprogramming no longer takes
place.</p><p>Reference:   Lecture 4.2</p></div>
