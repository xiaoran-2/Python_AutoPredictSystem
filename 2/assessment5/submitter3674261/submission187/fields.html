    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG
islands are generally hypomethylated (not methylated).  This allows normal expression of associated
genes.    In cancer, CpG islands associated with some
genes become hypermethylated (that is heavily methylated) which has the effect of silencing the associated gene.   This silencing occurs because the methylation of CpG islands forms a condensed chromatin structure.  If the gene that becomes supressed happens to be a tumor
suppressor gene,  then this CpG methylation will impair the gene's tumor suppressor
function.   This, of course, can contribute to cancer.  <br /><br />The methylation pattern of repetitive elements (repeats) and intergenic
regions is different.  Normally, they are heavily methylated. 
In repeats, this methylation acts to silence the repeat to prevent transposition, repeat mutation, and transcriptional interference from strong promoters.  In intergenic regions the methylation maintains genomic integrity.  In
cancer, these regions can become hypomethylated (non-methylated).   This can activate the repeats and intergenic regions which leads to genomic instability.  Changes to the genome can include: genetic
deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations. 

Of course, these serious mutations can lead to cancer.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprint control regions (ICR) can be either methylated or unmethylated. Methylated ICRs are associated with gene expression while unmethylated ICRs are associated with gene suppression.  In the case of the H19//Igf2 cluster, normally only one of the 2 alleles is methylated.  Specifically, the ICR around the H19/Igf2 cluster on the Paternal allele is normally methylated. 
This allows the expression of Igf2. 
On the Maternal allele, the ICR around the H19/Igf2 cluster is normally unmethylated.  Thus, Ifg2 is not expressed from the maternal allele.  (Again, only 1 of the 2 Igf2 genes is normally expressed- the one from the paternal allele). <br /><br />In the case of patients with Wilm’s tumor, the ICR around the H19/Igf2 cluster on the maternal
allele is also methylated (that is, the ICR around H19/Igf2 clusters on BOTH alleles are methylated).  Thus, Igf2 is expressed from both alleles which effectively leads to a ‘double dose’ of Igf2.   Igf2 is a growth promoting gene and so the
‘double dose’ can lead to faster cell growth and thus to cancer.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor (DNA-methyltransferase
inhibitor). (Note that these drugs are also called DNA-demethylating agents in the article).  Decitabine acts by inhibiting the DNA
methylation of CpG islands. This is important because methylated CpG islands prevent the expression of the associated genes. Thus, by removing the methylation, Decitabine allows the associated gene(s) to be expressed. <br /><br />This is important for patients with cancer because, in cancer, CpG islands associated with tumor suppression gene become hypermethylated.  Thus those genes are NOT expressed.  This leads to tumor development and growth.  Therefore, Decitabine acts by removing the methylation of the CpG islands and thus the tumor suppression genes are able to be expressed. This, of
course,  allows the cell's normal tumor suppression function to work and this has an anti-tumor effect. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an example of an epigenetic mark that is mitotically heritable.  (that is, passed down through cell division).  Therefore, any drug induced DNA methylation changes will be passed on to daughter cells and will in essence become 'permanent'.  This explains how a drug that changes DNA methylation can have effects that last longer than the period of treatment. <br /><br />Sensitive periods are the times during an organism’s
life that epigenetic changes naturally occur. 
Sensitive periods include early development as well as
during germ cell development (which lasts into adolescence).  Since drug treatments that permanently effect
epigenetic action last thru the life of the patient, using those drugs during
sensitive periods may have profound (and currently not well understood) side
effects.  Therefore these drugs should
only be used on adult patients (and female patients on these drugs should not
become pregnant!)   <br /><br /><br /></div>
