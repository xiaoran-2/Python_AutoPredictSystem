    <h1>Submission 768 from Anon (session_user_id: 3777edae918560acb29b390afc3487032fc24cc3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine it´s a DNA-demethylating agent and acts by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases, thus allowing the activation of the gene that was silenced. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by preventing the addition of methyl molecules to the newly synthesized DNA strand by means of the DNMT, specially in cancer cells because of their fast replication rate. This drug can avoid the silencing of tumour suppressor genes by this mechanism. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell the CpG islands are not methylated while in a cancer cell they are. Cancer usually arises from hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes causing its silencing.<br /><br />In a normal cell the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated while in a cancer cell they are hypomethylated. This can result in recombination events and transposition, leading to inactivation or activation of the genes where these repeats are inserted, thus producing genetic instability. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele has the imprint control region methylated that prevents the binding of CTCF, and also has H19 methylated. This leads to the enhancers acting on Igf2 allowing its expression. In contrast, the maternal allele doesn´t have these regions methylated and CTCF can bind to the imprint control region and the enhancers will act on H19, while Igf2 will remain silenced. <br /><br />In Wilm´s tumour there is hypermethylation in the maternal allele and expresses Igf2 like the paternal allele, thus producing a double douse of Igf2, which is a growth promoter associated with cancer development. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes on the methylation pattern of the DNA are mitotically inherited, so interfering with the enzymes that regulate the methylation and demethylation will have lasting effects on the patient. <br /><br />A sensitive period refers to the time when epigenetic reprogramming is taking place in the cell and is very sensitive to the environment. These periods occur in the primordial germ cell development and in early development. Treating the patients in these periods would be inadvisable because of the genetic instability that can happen if the genome is not methylated correctly or if others epigenetic mechanisms get modified. <br /></div>
