    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is altered in cancer.  One of the primary alterations found in cancer cells are the degree to which CpG islands and CpG island shores are methylated.  CpG islands are DNA regions of high CpG density and are found in ~60% of promoters.  These CpG islands are generally kept free of methylation independent of the gene's activity state.  When these CpG islands are methylated it results in suppression of the associated gene.  In cancer, CpG islands are frequently hypermethylated resulting in the suppression of the associated gene.  If the associated gene is a tumor suppressor then hypermethylation of the CpG island in the promoter region essentially "knocks out" the gene function resulting in a loss of suppressor function.  This can be counted as one of the hits of the required "two hits" of the Knudson hypothesis for cancer genesis.  Tumor suppressor hypermethylation is more frequent than mutations, varies by tumor type, progresses with time and is the primary driver for tumor suppressor hypermethylation driven tumors.<br /><br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is suppressive: it silences repetitive elements and participates in the formation of heterochromatin.  In cancer, these regions of methylation are found to be decreased i.e., they are hypomethylated regions.  This general loss of methylation results in a more open chromatin state resulting in active expression of repetitive elements. Active repetitive elements may "jump" into other chromosomal regions disrupting genes and/or forming fusion genes as well as enabling translocations.  The resultant alterations in gene function may promote transformation and the eventual formation of cancer.  In tumors driven by chromosomal instability depletion of DNA methylation enhances tumorigenesis.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of imprinting is a common early event and is often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue.  In this example, on the paternal allele the imprint control region is methylated. This methylation blocks binding by the CTCF protein.  Without CTCF binding, DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter region silencing the expression of a long ncRNA.  The lack of this long ncRNA allows the downstream enhancers to have access to Igf2 resulting in its activation and expression.  In the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and CTCF binds to it preventing methylation of the H19 promoter region.  As a result, the long ncRNA is expressed.  It blocks access of downstream enhancers to the Igf2 site effectively silencing its expression.  In Wilm's tumor imprinting is lost due to hypermethylation of the ICR on both the maternal and paternal alleles causing expression of both the maternal and paternal Igf2 genes resulting in a double dose of the Igf2 growth promoter. In this case, it is this double dose of a growth promoter that drives tumorigenesis. Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and/or overexpression of growth promoting genes contributing to tumorigenesis.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an FDA approved hypomethylating agent used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).  Decitabine ( 5-aza-2'-deoxycitidine) belongs to the DNMT inhibitor class of drugs.  It is a cytidine analog that inhibits DNA methyltransferase causing DNA hypomethylation.  Decitabine's anti-neoplastic effects are secondary to its incorporation into DNA and subsequent inhibition of DNA methyltransferase causing hypomethylation.  Hypomethylation may result in the restoration of function of tumor suppressor genes previously silenced by DNA hypermethylation.  In tumors driven by loss of tumor suppressor genes, the restoration of tumor suppressor functions such as cellular differentiation, braking cellular proliferation, inducing senescence and apoptosis contribute to the arrest of the cancer. It may also exert direct cytotoxic effects by forming covalent bonds to DNMTs in rapidly dividing cells.  It is cell cycle specific acting principally in the S phase of the cell cycle.  Nonproliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome beyond the period of drug treatment because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and in some cases it may be transgenerationally inheritable although clear evidence is lacking in humans. One should avoid treating patients with these drugs during periods of development when epigenetic marks are being reset/reprogrammed.  These periods of epigenetic reprogramming are known as sensitive periods.  There are 2 major sensitive periods during development: the first during pre-implantation/early 
implantation and the second during primordial germ cell/gamete 
development.  Interfering with/altering the reprogramming of epigenetic marks such as methylation during these periods will impact development and as such it is inadvisable.  Treating patients with DNA methylation altering drugs 
during sensitive periods may lead to a number of complications including
 loss of imprinting, disrupted cellular differentiation, loss 
of/decrease in fertility and loss of fetal viability.<br /></div>
