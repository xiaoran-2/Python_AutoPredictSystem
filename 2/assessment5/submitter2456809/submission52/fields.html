    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, DNA methylation means silencing of the promotor.<br />In cancer cells, CpG island of the "tumor supressor gene"  are methylated. So, the cancer is not supressed.</p><p>The cancer become more malignant, the more CpG island methylation. CpG island methylation progresses from early stage to end-stage.</p><p></p><p>Intergenic region and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells. </p><p>It is hypomethylated in cancer cells.</p><p>Intergenic region and repetitive elements are originated from transposon.  Transposons are retrovirus origin.  Those translocates spontanously, if not methylated.  Repetitive elements have much similarity about their sequence. It might cause translocation  of the Chromosomes. DNA methylation blocks those translocations.</p><p></p><p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 &amp; ICF gene are methylated in paternal gene. It blocks Enhancer to bind H19 gene. ICF gene could not bind CTCF. So, the enhancers can bind Igf2 gene and activates Igf2. Igf2 is expressed.</p><p>In maternal allel,  ICF and H19 are not methylated.  CTCF can bind ICF.  CTCF blocks enhancer to bind Igf2. So, the Igf2 are not expressed. Instead the enhancer can bind H19 allel, so H19 is expressed.</p><p>In Wilms tumour, maternal allel is methylated, and this means the samecondition of paternal pattern. It is called bipaternal pattern.</p><p>In Wilms tumor, Igf2 allel is not supressed in maternal allels, so Igf2 product is doubled (over expression).  Igf2 is promotes cell proliferation, so induce cell proliferation.  H19 allels are supressed bilaterally. CTCF does not bind. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA methyl transferase inhibitor.</p><p>Decitabine blockes DNA methylation.  Tumor supressor genes are often supressed by CpG island methylation. When you prescribe Decitabine, CpG islands are not methylated after mitosis. So, it recovers tumour supressor activity. Daughter or grand-daughter cells thereafter will not be methylated any more.　It  switched off epigenetic markers of the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As mentioned above, once you changed epigenetic marks of the tumour cells by some drugs,  this condition is inherited to the daghter and grand-daughter cells. DNA methylation change have enduring effects thus.</p><p>Sensitive period of the epigenetics are<br />1. Early development stage after fertilization, until epiblast.<br />2. Germ cell development stage. (Oocytegenesis or spermatogenesis)</p><p>Most DNA methylation marks are erased during these stages.</p><p>In early development stage, imprinted genes are preserved methylation. Imprinting genes are important for placental  and brain development.  So, if you treat with  demethylating drugs,  it cause serious damage for brain and placenta.</p><p>During germ cell harvest, it is also hypomethylated. If you disturve these development, it causes malformation or cancer of next generations.</p><p><br /></p></div>
