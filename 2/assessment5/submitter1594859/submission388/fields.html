    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands in a gene promoter are usually unmethylated, methylation would silence the gene expression. In cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated, which may result for example in permanent silencing of tumor suppressor genes, and this leads to survival of a cancer cell.<br />Intergenic regions and repetitve elements are normally methylated and inactive. They are hypomethylated in cancer cells, which makes them accessible to recombination and replication enzymes, and it ends up with increased genomic instability (disruption of genes due to recombination, or insertion, or deletion).<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Hypermethylation of ICRs is often associated with loss of imprinting. As a result, either both the maternal and the paternal alleles are expressed, or they are both silenced.<br />Igf2 is a growth promoting gene. Here, the ICR is the binding site for insulator protein CTCF. On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and allows binding of CTCF. Bound CTCF prevents contact between Igf2 promoter and the downstream enhancer. The enhancer binds to H19 instead. As a result, H19 is expressed and Igf2 is not.<br />On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, and CTCF cannot bind. The enhancer is able to bind to Igf2 promoter, which leads to its expression. <br />In Wilm's tumor the ICR on both paternal and maternal chromosomes is methylated, leading to overexpression of Igf2. And since Igf2 codes for a growth promoting factor, its overexpression results in uncontrolled cell growth, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of de novo methyltransferase inhibitors. It is a nucleoside analogue, and is incorporated into DNA upon DNA replication. As a part of DNA, decitabine binds irreversibly to DNMT and inactivates it. Because cancer cells divide rapidly, they incorporate higher amounts of decitabine in their DNA, and are therefore more affected than normal cells. So one could say, decitabine is relatively specific to cancer cells. If DNMTs are inactive in cancer cells, the DNA becomes less methylated with every cell division, and probably the expression of tumor suppressor genes, previously silenced through DNA methylation, can be restored.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark, it is mitotically heritable, so any changes in DNA methylation are maintained in subsequent generations of cells (due to enzymes like DNMT1).<br />In sensitive periods of development epigenetic reprogramming occurs, epigenetic marks are mainly cleared and reset (DNA methylation as well). At that point environmental conditions the organism is exposed to can influence the way epigenetic marks are being reset (that's why it's called a sensitive period). There are two general sensitive periods, early embryonic development and germ cell development. The latter is of interest, because if a young patient is treated with epigenetic drugs that alter DNA methylation during this sensitive period, it can result in stable alteration of patient's germ cell epigenetic state, which could lead to some inherited damages in offspring.<br /></div>
