    <h1>Submission 545 from Anon (session_user_id: f7a71e10f6aa61eb088fb9931b811d5ee02ca0a1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">-  As DNA methylation is mitotic heritable, alterations in DNA methylation status is passed on to daughter and granddaughter cells. Thus reversion of tumour-progressing DNA methylation in cancer cells by treament with a DNA-demethylating agent, is also passed on to the daughter and granddaughter cells. <br /><br />- A sensitive period is a period during which epigenetic reprogramming takes place, i.e. epigenetic marks are cleared and resetted. <br /><br />- Sensitive periods occur during primordial germ cell development and early development. <br /><br />- It is inadvisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods as this highly will interfer with the correct clearing and reprogramming of epigenetic marks. If the reprogramming of the epigenetic marks goes wrong these mistakes are passed on to daughter and granddaughter cells. Women should not be treated while being pregnant as this can change her epigenetic marks as well as alter the epigenetic marks in the embryo and the embryo's germ cells. Also, the long term effects on germ cells upon treament with DNA-demethylating agents in younger patients should also be considered as mistakes in germ cell specific epigenetic marks are passed on to their children. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">- The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression. CpG islands at promoter regions tend to be unmethylated in normal cells. <br /><br />- In normal cells CpG islands at promoter regions are generally unmethylated (hypomethylated). In cancer cells, locus specific CpG islands in promoter regions of growth restriction genes are being methylated, and the methylation progressess with time and development into cancer cells. <br /><br />- The methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions of growth restriction genes (tumour supressor genes) in cancer cells gives rise to silencing of gene expression from the particular gene. The silencing of gene expression from tumour suppressor genes stimulates cell growth and progression into cancer cells. <br /><br />- In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated (hypermethylated) in order to control/silence their expression. Silencing of cryptic transcription start sites and splice sites as well as repetitive elements ensure genomic stability by preventing transposition, transcriptional interference and illigitimate recombination. <br /><br />- In cancer cells, an overall hypomethylation (demethylated) of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is observed. <br /><br />- Lack of methylation of cryptic transcription sites and splice sites can give rise to disrupted gene expression. Actively expressed repetivite elements can produce new repetitive elements that can insert into other places in the genome by transposition. This insertion can disrupt the expression from genes located at the insertion site giving rise to truncated gene products. Also, the enhancer and promoter regions of the repetitive elements can stimulate the expression from nearby located genes. Illigitimate recombination between repetitive elements can also occur.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/igf2 cluster consists of the Igf2 gene, an imprint control region (ICR), the H19 gene and upstream enhancers.<br /><br />- The paternal allel is methylated at the ICR and the H19 promoter region. The methylation at the H19 promoter silences the H19 gene expression. Uptream enhancer can now regulate the expression of the Igf2 gene and Igf2 is expressed.<br /><br />- The maternal allel is not methylated at the ICR, which makes it possible for the ICR to bind to insulator protein CTCF. CTCF-binding at the ICR blocks the action of upstream enhancers on the gene expression from Igf2 - and Igf2 gene expression is now silenced. Instead, the H19 gene is expressed.<br /><br />- In Wilm's tumour, both the maternal and the paternal allel are methylated at the ICR and H19 promoter region, therefore both behave as paternal allels. <br /><br />- As methylation of the ICR blocks binding to the insulator protein CTCF, the Igf2 gene is expressed from both the maternal and the paternal allels, i.e. a double dose of Igf2 is observed. As Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, the double dose of Igf2 stimulates cell growth. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">-The epigenetic inhibitor Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents.<br /><br />- Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase-inhibitor (DNMTi), and DNMT-inhibitors are nucleoside analogues that are incorporated into DNA during replication. When DNA methyltransferases subsequently bind to these analogues in order to copy methylation to daughter strands, the DNMT-protein is irreversible bound to the analogue.<br /><br />- As Decitabine is incorporated into DNA during replication, the action of this DNMTi requires cell division. A key feature of cancer cells is rapid cell division, so cancer cells will experience less DNA methyltransferase activity as DNMTs are irreversible bound to inhibitors upon treatment with Decitabine. If hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoters of growth restriction genes is present in the specific cancer type, treatment with Decitabine can reverse this hypermethylation-related gene silencing by preventing DNA methylation and thereby suppress tumour growth.</div>
