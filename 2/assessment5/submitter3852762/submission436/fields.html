    <div class="field-value"><span>Most DNA methylation is essential for normal development, and it palsy a
very important role in a number of key processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome
inactivation and suppression of repetitive elements transcription and
transposition. DNA methylation and histone modification patterns are altered in
cancers.  Approximately 70% of genes
possess promoter-associated CpG islands that mostly remain unmethylated in
normal cells unlike the remainder of the genome, which tends to be heavily
methylated such as the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Maintenance
of an unmethylated promoter CpG island positively contributes to a high
transcriptional potential and is associated with active histone modifications
including histone H3 and H4 acetylation and methylation at H3K4.<i> </i><i>In </i>cancer, cells
exhibit dense hypermethylation of up to 10% of CpG islands as well as
hypomethylation of bulk chromatin including intergenic regions and repetitive
elements. The mechanism involved is not clear. A densely methylated CpG island
is capable of driving chromatin compaction and repressing gene expression in
association with repressive modifications including H3K9me2/3, H3K27me3, and/or
H4K20me3. On the other hand, hypomethylation of intergenic consequently leads
to activation of transposable elements which contributes to genomic instability
observed in cancer cells. So too is the repetitive element. Genomic instability may result from Illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes (c.f. <i>A</i>vy and <i>Axin</i>fu alleles).<span></span></span><p></p><span></span><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>IGF2/H19 cluster are involved in
growth regulation. Adjacent to these genes is a region known as imprinting
center 1 (ICR1) which controls the parent-specific genomic imprinting of the H19
and IGF2 genes. In most tissues, IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele while
that of the maternal allele is silent and the reverse is true with H19 which is
only expressed from the maternal allele. This implies in normal cells, there is
hypermethylation of the IGF2 gene in the maternal and hypermethylation of the
H19 gene in the paternal allele. This phenomenon is known genomic imprinting. In
Wilms tumours there is loss of imprinting (LOI) linked to specific alterations
in the methylation patterns of both IGF2 and H19 genes. These methylation
changes affect the maternally inherited IGF2 and H19 genes such that there is
hypermethylation at H19 and hypomethylation at IGF2. Concomitant with these
methylation changes is a reversal in the normal pattern of gene expression such
that the maternally inherited H19 and alleles are silenced and activated
respectively. Expression of both maternal and paternal IGF2 genes (biallelic
expression) will increase the amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 that cells
can produce thereby stimulating proliferation, and increased risk of tumour.</p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a member of a new
class of drugs known as DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) that
demethylate DNA.  Methylation of DNA is a major mechanism that regulates
gene expression in cells.  When there is an increase in DNA methylation
this can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes"
that regulate cell division and growth.  When suppressor genes are
blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. 
</p><p>Decitabine's anticancer effects are
believed to be twofold.   Firstly, it works is by demethylation
or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By this process of
demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus
restoring control over cell growth. </p><p>Decitabine is an antimetabolites.  When the cells incorporate
these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of
targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death
of rapidly dividing cancer cells. </p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs may alter epigenetic homeostasis by direct or indirect
mechanisms. Direct effects may be caused by drugs which affect chromatin
architecture or DNA methylation. For example the antihypertensive hydralazine
inhibits DNA methylation. An example of an indirectly acting drug is
isotretinoin, which has transcription factor activity. A two-tier mechanism has
been postulated for indirect effects in which acute exposure to a drug
influences signaling pathways that may lead to an alteration of transcription
factor activity at gene promoters. This stimulation results in the altered
expression of receptors, signaling molecules, and other proteins necessary to
alter genetic regulatory circuits. With more chronic exposure, cells adapt by
an unknown process that results in more permanent modifications to DNA
methylation and chromatin structure, leading to enduring alteration of a given
epigenetic network. Therefore, any epigenetic side-effect caused by a drug may
persist after the drug is discontinued. Early life is usually the sensitive period
(during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic
mechanisms) for these alterations. DNA methylation effects might be extremely
teratogenic during embryogenesis and might have potential carcinogenic effects.
Therefore it is not advisable to treat patients during these periods considering
the effects on the germ cells.</p><span>
