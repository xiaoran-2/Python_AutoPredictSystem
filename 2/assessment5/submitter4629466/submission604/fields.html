    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation, as repressive epigenetic mark, is commonly set on CpG islands to silence their promoters of particular genes. That happens in the case of cancer when CpG islands that are not methylated in healthy cells become methylated in high density (hypermetylated) and thus silenced (inactive). The genes with abnormally hypermetylated CpG islands in cancer usually carry information for tumor suppressor proteins that act on preventing tumor growth and spreading through body, like providing programmed cell death for abnormal mutated cells, repairing their damaged genetic material and control cell division in general. Their function in disabled in cancer cells, so they became invasive for organism. Cancer diseases, that appeared as the consequences of this epigenetic disruption are well described  in scientific literature, for example silencing of BRCA1 allele in breast cancer which normally suppresses tumor growth.
They are also intergenic regions and repetitive elements in human genome which contain unnecessary genes (popularly called genetic junk). Their disrupt genome and need to be silenced by DNA methylation, which is the characteristic of normal cells. I consider repetitive elements more problematic because they have cryptic promoters with genes that code for proteins that make them copy themselves in multiple copies and insert anywhere in genome causing disruption of functional genes, such as tumor supressors, that leads to their inactivation. In the opposite of the case described above, they must be silenced because of their infunctionality, but in cancer they are not methylated and inactivated. Their transcription is allowed, so they, as mentioned above, cause genome disruption (mutations) that make somatic cells cancerous.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinted genes in general have on active copy (from one parent) while other is silenced epigenetically. On the paternal chromosome , H19 gene is metylated (silenced) so Igf2 gene cannot be repressed by the binding of CTCF repressive protein (which is inactive then)  and enhancer factors can improve Igf2 expression. In contrast, on maternal cgromosome Igf2 is inactivated because of expression CTCF protein  which enables the expression of H19 gene. Enhacer factors also have positive effect on them.<br />In Wilm's tumour, maternal gene copy is deleted (containing Igf2 repressive genes) or has active Igf2 gene or inactive CTCF protein (which is normal only on parental chromosome) so parental Igf2 gene is duplicated which causes overexpression i.e. over production of Igf2 protein which causes overgrowth of somatic tissues. <br />Similarly, in cancers, Igf2 acts as oncogene causing abnormal cell division if it is duplicated as a result of its activation on maternal chromosome or duplication of paternal chromosome. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabin is epigenetic drug which belongs to DNA demetylators (inhibits DNA metylation). It affects on hypermetylated genes by removing repressive metyl marks from particular genes (i.e. acting like TET protein) and provides their activity. That genes are usually tumor supressors which have the essential information for controling abnormal cells (repair DNA damage, regulation number and speed of cell division, inducing programmed cell death for abnormal mutated cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic drugs usually work in DNA demetylating manner by removing excessive DNA metylation marks and prevent their positioning on the genome places where they shoud not be. Perhaps they affect the protein factors (like TET, protein or DNA demetylase) that remove repressive metyl marks. In sensitive period of development (erasing and reseting epigenetic marks on genom), epigenom is susceptible to agents casing alternations (epimutations) that can disrupt regular genetic expression of particular genetic locus. It happens in early embryonic development (differentiation) and primordial germ cell formation. I would neither recommend treating younger patients (in reproductive age) with such drugs because they can affect their gametes (even though sensitive period is over) by causing epimutations that can be passed on their descendants. <br /></div>
