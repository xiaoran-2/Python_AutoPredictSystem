    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Lack of methylation of the maternal imprint control region allows CTCF (insulator element) to bind to the maternal ICR creating a physical barrier blocking the distal enhancers and preventing their access to the IGF2 promoter region.In this case enhancers will act on H19 and IGF2 will be silent..Paternal allele CTCF binding is blocked by methylation of the IGF2/H19 ICR allowing enhancers to act on the IGF2 promoter resulting in normal expression of IGF2.In Wilm's tumor with loss of imprinting on the maternal allele.we have methylation of ICR and expression of IGF2.just like in paternal allele.So both alleles express IGF2 gene.IGF2 is growth promoting gene (most of the imprinting genes are involved in growth) and IGF2 overexpression  is associated with Wilms tumor.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is demethylating agent,cytidine analog which inhibits DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1).DNMT1 shows a high preference for hemimethylated CG sites after DNA replication and its required for restoring the original DNA methylation pattern.It bind decitabine in irreversibly manner.in the daughter strand after replication.DNA methyltransferase activity is proliferation dependent.Cancer cells are more sensitive to decitabine because they are dividing more rapidly than other cells in the body.Inhibiting DNMT1 is known to reverse the hypermethylation,leading to reactivation of the tumor suppressor genes.DNMT inhibitors are not selective and we don't know about possible effect on other dividing cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is associated with chromatin structure.Euchromatin regions of the DNA which are linked to the actively transcribed genes contains hypomethylated DNA and in the condensed,inactive heterochromatin DNA is hypermethylated.Human genes promoter regions contain CpG rich regions which is known as CpG islands.CpG islands are normally unmethylated in active genes.Methylation of gene promoters interferes with the binding of certain transcription factors and in the end that leads to the chromatin configuration which silence the gene.In normal cells DNA methylation plays important role in cellular differentiation and development because different CG sites are methylated in different tissue and in silencing the expression of imprinted and inactive X chromosome genes.In cancer cells CpG islands of some tumor suppressor and DNA repair genes are hypermethylated.Inactivation of these genes promote tumor growth.In normal cell methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions prevents genomic instability.Transposable elements cannot be activated in methylated environment.In cancer cells global hypomethylation triggers genomic instability,abnormal transcription initiations,illegitimate recombination and activation of transposons which lead to gene disruption.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable but in absence of DNMT activity it results in hypomethylation in the daughter cells and eventually to reactivation of silenced gene expression.Normal cells are likely to survive hypomethylation whereas cancer cells tend to be killed or stop dividing.We should consider treating younger patients with drugs which alter epigenetic machinery especially in sensitive period of developing germ cells.<br /></div>
