    <div class="field-value"><p>Regardless of the impending mutational
hazard, DNA methylation i.e. simple addition of a single methyl (CH3-) group to
cytosine at position 5 of CpG is crucial for life. Special DNA methyltransferases
(DNMT1, 3a and 3b) establish and maintain DNA methylation required for proper
embryogenesis and development, sustenance of chromosomal stability, telomere
length, and predetermined gene expression states in mammals predominantly. CpG islands are usually
protected from DNA methylation but incidental occurrence of the DNA methylation
at CpG islands constitutes the normal gene function of gene
silencing (inactive epigenetic mark) like X-chromosome inactivation in females,
developmental transcriptional regulation, genomic imprinting and
tissue-specific expression of a gene. DNA methylation at the CpG leads to
epigenetic silencing of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, DNA repair genes,
apoptosis mediators, nuclear receptors, transcription factors, cell adhesion
molecules, etc. which contributes to cancer. Normally within
the intergenic regions, one of the main roles of DNA methylation is to repress
the expression of potentially harmful genetic elements. In normal cells CpG islands (CGI) are
hypomethylated whereas intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements
exhibit hypermethylation. DNA methylation patterns undergo complex
changes in cancer and contrastingly CGI is hypermethylated in tumor but the repetitive
sequences, introns and inner exons display hypomethylation. For the CpG
islands, this leads to problems, as tumor suppressor genes, which are
detrimental in regulation of the cell cycle, are disrupted. DNA methylation
thus leads to uncontrolled proliferation of the cells, avoiding the growth
signals, failure of natural mechanism of cell death (apoptosis) to prevail,
formation of secondary tumors, angiogenesis. For the intergenic regions and
repetitive elements, normally hypermethylation at these sites is associated
with greater genomic stability, but hypomethylation during cancer gives rise to
copying errors such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in
the chromosomes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In an H19/Igf2 cluster which is located and closely linked
to Chromosome 11 and is controlled by enhancer blocking, generally methylation
of the paternal allele is noticed at this Imprint Controlled region (ICR).  It can be declared paternally imprinted as
the DNA methylation imprint is on the paternal chromosome and there is no
methylation on the maternal allele.  Unmethylated CTCF will therefore bind to the
insulator protein and H19 is the long non-coding RNA produced as a result only
on the maternal strand.  Enhancers act on
H19 but the expression is prevented due to Igf2 being silence on the maternal
allele. Due to methyl marks on the ICR the CTCF does not bind to paternal
allele, which results in the silencing of the H19 gene as the enhancers
contrastingly target Igf2 expression. A normal cell would have equal dosage of
both H19 from the maternal allele and Igf2 from paternal allele. Pertaining to loss of imprinting, ICR becomes
hypermethylated, and both strands appear to be of paternal nature and hence are
expressed in that manner. Thus the cluster gets a double dose of
growth-promoting Igf2 and is devoid of H19. This contributes to Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors
called DNMTi (DNA Methyltransferase inhibitors). These enzymatic inhibitors target the
enzymatic regulators, which are attributed by the establishment and withdrawal
of an epigenetic mark. The epigenetic inhibitors target the active site of the
enzymes  i.e. enzymes are either trapped
or blocked. Small molecules can block the catalytic pocket of free DNMT
proteins effectively. DNMTi’s can be portrayed as a nucleoside analogue. Chemical
reversal of gene silencing is the fundamental of the Decitabine’s division
dependent mechanism. Its effect on replicating cells is inhibition of cell
synthesis and inducing cell arrest. Decitabine administered in low doses works by
inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, reversing the methylation and leading to
reactivation of silenced genes. Decitabine by its hypomethylating action induces a chemical
reaction thus damaging the DNA in a cell conferring an anti-tumor effect. The
damage of DNA inturn inhibits protein synthesis and leads to cell death.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The lasting effects of drugs that alter DNA methylated
regions beyond the period of treatment are possible. The ensuing effects are
due to the methyl marks, which are preserved by mitotic cell division by DNA
methyltransferase enzymes. Sensitive periods can be described as altered
environments that impact epigenetic makeup.  Developmental sensitive periods are that of the
period of primordial germ development to production of gametes (mature oocyte
and sperm) and the pre-implantation and early post implantation period constitute
the other. Active remodeling or reprogramming of the genome occurs during this
period i.e. establishing and withdrawal of epigenetic marks. It would be
inadvisable to treat patients and administer these epigenetic drugs at the time
of pregnancy that also includes the period of the formation of the egg and
sperms that are fertilized.  This is due
to the fact that extensive genomic reprogramming occurs during early embryonic development
and could lead to transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.</p></div>
