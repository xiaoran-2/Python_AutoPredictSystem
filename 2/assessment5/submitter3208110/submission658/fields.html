    <div class="field-value">The CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) islands are regions with at least 200 base pairs, and a GC percentage that is greater than 50%, in human and other mammalian genomes, CpG islands are typically 300-3,000 base pairs in length, and have been found in or near approximately 40% of promoters of mammalian genes. <br />Normally, the methylation at CpG islands leds to inhibit the gene expresion.<br />There is a lot of evidence of implications of CpG methylation and its correlation in cancer develoapment. Peter Jones et al reported that the hypermethylation at CpG regions in the promoters of Tumor Suppressor Genes, are strongly associated with some types of cancer in humans.<br />In the other hand, the  hypomethylation of CpG sites in  oncogenes are related to Cancer.<br />The hypomethylation of the oncogenes, promotes the over expresion of these genes, allowing the develoapment of the carcinogenic potencial of the tumoral cells.[1]<br /><br />Changes in methylation are associated with the regulation of gene transcription, embryonic development, differentiation and carcinogenesis, in normal cells the intergenic region and the repetitive elements are methylated [2].<br />The methylation of the of the intergenic region has a very important role in the genomic stability. <br />When the intergenic regions or the repetitive elements are hypomethylated, could occur a illegitimate recombination between that repetitive elemnts, or this elements could suffer transposition. <br />These events generate chromosomal inestability, which enhance tumorigenesis potencial of cells [3].<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />(1) Nature Genetics 21, 163 - 167 (1999)<br />(2) <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/08887543" title="Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/08887543">Genomic</a>s, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/08887543/99/1" title="Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/08887543/99/1">Volume 99, Issue 1</a>, January 2012, Pages 10–17<br />(3) Plos one 6(12):e28141 (2011)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <div class="field-value"><div>In humans, IGF2 and H19, are imprinted and monoallelically expressed (oppositely imprinted). <br />The IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele while H19 is expressed only from the maternal allele.<br />IGF2 is an embryonal growth factor and H19 is a gene for a long noncoding RNA [1]. <br /><span>Usually, the paternal copy of H19 is methylated and silent while the maternal copy is hypomethylated or unmethylated and expressed in the offspring cell.<br /></span>In the other hand, ICR of  IGF2 is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele that allows the expression of IGF2 only of the paternal allele and the H19 only on the maternal allele.<br />In Wilm's tumour, in the maternal allele, both the ICR of H19/IGF2, and the H19 region are methylated, that allows the expresion of the IGT2 of the both alleles, the over expression of this gene enhance the growing fo the tumoural cells [2].<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />1.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>

    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a cytidine analog, it belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents, it can inhibit the  the DNA methyltransferase enzyme. <br />Decitabine and azacitidine (Vidaza) are used to treat <span>myelodysplastic syndromes, and acute myeloid leukaemia. <br />Both drugs can hypomethylate the DNA by the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, Decitabine only works on DNA, meanwhile Azacitidine works in DNA and RNA.<br />The anti-tumor effect is due to that drugs can incorporate to the DNA and avoid the methylation and the aberrantly silencing of tumor supressor genes, which, after the drug intake can be expressed and stop the tumor growing.<br /><br /><br />CANCER April 15, 2006 / Volume 106 / Number 8<br /></span>The Economist. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" title="Link: http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">Cancer's epicentre</a>. (2012, 7th April). <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since the DNA methylation is a hereditary modification, the  use of drugs which alter the epigenetic state of tumors, can have enduring effects that let people with certain cancer types, take the anticancer drugs for a limited period of time, but with long term benefits.<br />One of the requirements to assure the therapy success is to use that chemotherapeutic agents in the adequate moment of the tumor development. That moment is called "sensitive period" which is a period of time in which the tumour is more susceptible to environmental signals. For example in the normal development  of a human been, there is 2 important sensitive period: the preinplantation development and germ cell development. <br />Since the effect of the hypomethylating agents or other epigenetic modifiers drugs depends of the tumor's development period, in some patients with tumours in a no sensitive period of development that drugs could not be such effective as in patients with tumours in a sensitive period.  <br /><br /><br />Hum Genet (2012) 131:1565–1589<br />The Economist. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">Cancer's epicentre</a>. (2012, 7th April). <br /></div>
