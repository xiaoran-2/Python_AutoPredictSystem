    <div class="field-value">Cancer is a complex disease that can have many causes.  Some of those causes are genetic and others are epigenetic. One of the most important epigenetic causes is the DNA methylation abnormalities. It is also one of the better understood. These DNA methylation abnormalities can be locus specific (at CpG islands) or genome-wide.
In a normal cell, the CpG islands (usually found in the promoters of tumor suppressors) are not methylated and so the genes are expressing the tumor suppressors. This also happens in the CpG islands shores (2kb neighbouring  CpG islands), they are usually not methylated in normal cells.
In a cancer cell, these CpG islands and shores are hypermethylated, which leads to gene silencing. As many of these CpG islands are in the promoters of tumor suppressors, these genes are not expressed and the growth rate of the cell is not regulated.
Regarding to the DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, in a normal cell we find those regions methylated and therefore the genomic stability is maintained as there can’t be recombination between repeats, they are inactive and can’t transpose and the cryptic promoters are silenced.
In a cancer cell these intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This causes genomic instability, because now the repetitive elements are active, they can copy themselves and move through the genome. Cryptic promoters are active too and this means that some genes that are normally silenced are now active (activation of oncogenes).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer and one example is the H19/Igf2 cluster. In this cluster we find the Igf2 gene, an imprinted control region, the promoter of a long non coding RNA called H19 and finally a few enhancers.
In normal cells, this cluster is paternally imprinted. The paternal allele is methylated at the ICR. This methylation of the ICR spreads to the promoter of H19. Because of the methylation, a protein called CTCF can’t bind to the ICR and this allows the enhancers to act on Igf2. Igf2 is expressed. The maternal allele, on the other hand, is not methylated at the ICR, so CTCF binds the ICR and insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers that are now going to act on H19, so in this case Igf2 is not being expressed but H19 is.
In cancer cells, as for example in Wilm’s tumor, we find that there is a hypermethylation of ICR. Both alleles, the maternal and paternal, are methylated at ICR, which causes that in both cases the Igf2 gene is expressed. As Igf2 is a growth promoter, the cells will grow without regulation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes that can progress to acute myelogenous leukaemia. It is a drug that can affect the epigenetic state of a cell. Specifically, it is a DNA-demethylating agent that acts inhibiting the DNA methyltranferases. Decitabine is a cytidine analog (http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01262) that incorporates into DNA and binds DNA methyltransferases irreversibly. This reduces the level of free DNA methyltranferases and causes hypomethylation of the DNA and so genomic instability. Decitabine has an anti-tumour effect because it is replication dependent. This is because it is incorporated into DNA while the cell is replicating. In a tumour, the cell’s growth rate is much higher than in normal cells, and so the decitabine has a bigger effect in this kind of cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome even when the patient isn’t taking drugs anymore because epigenetic marks can be heritable and need to be actively removed. If they are not removed, even though the administration of the drug is stopped, the effects will last. 
The sensitive periods are periods of intense epigenetic reprogramming and are the primordial germ cell development and the pre-implantation period of early development. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because these drugs alter the epigenetic state. There are lots of genes that are imprinted, that need to be imprinted, the repeats need to be silenced, etc. and the administration of these drugs during these periods could result in activating repeats or cryptic promoters that need to be silenced and this could lead to cell death.</div>
