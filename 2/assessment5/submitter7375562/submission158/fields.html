    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, there tends to be a higher degree of global hypermethylation with corresponding hypomethylation of CpG islands. Just the opposite can be observed in cancer cells: global hypomethylation with hypermethylated CpG islands. In the latter scenario, the silencing of CpG islands via DNA methylation may inactive critical tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br />Loss of imprinting can also trigger certain types of cancer. For example, hypermethylation of H19 on the maternal allele can result in overexpression of Igf2, a growth-promoting gene that is normally expressed only from the paternal allele. The result is Wilm's tumor, a cancer of the kidney.<br /><br />Lastly, hypomethylation of the normally heterochromatic intergenic regions and repetitive elements can destabilize the chromosome, resulting in deletions, insertions, and/or reciprocal translocations. In some cases, the abnormal placement of a repeat can activate or disrupt neighboring genes. Activation of an oncogene or disruption of a tumor suppressor gene may result in cancer. Alternatively, a translocation can result in the fusion of two genes that are only deleterious if expressed in sequence. For example, a translocation between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 can generate BCR-ABL, a gene linked to chronic myeloid leukemia. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, Igf2 is paternally imprinted (it is only expressed from the paternal allele). On the paternal allele, H19, a gene that is preferentially transcribed if left unmethylated, is methylated. Since H19 is methylated, enhancers instead promote expression of Igf2. <br /><br />If H19 is methylated on <i>both </i>the maternal and paternal alleles, Igf2 expression will increase by twofold. Igf2 is a growth factor, and thus the result is uncontrolled cell growth and ultimately Wilm's tumor. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. Administration of small doses of decitabine reduce DNA methylation by irreversibly binding - and thus inhibiting - DNA-bound DNA methyltransferases. By inhibiting DNA methyltransferases, decitabine prevents methylation-mediated silencing of tumor suppressor genes in all daughter cells.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. If a drug alters an enzyme responsible for laying down or removing epigenetic marks, such as an HDAC or DNMT, then all cells in that lineage will be affected. For example, a pan HDACi will prevent histone deacetylation in a cancer cell. When that cell divides, there will also be limited HDAC activity in its progency. The cancer cell lineage will be permanently altered so that histones will have the normal pattern of acetyl markings rather than being deacetylated as they were in the progenitor cell.  <br /><br />A sensitive period of development is a time in which epigenetic marks are being actively laid down or removed. This occurs during early embryonic development and especially in the development of primordial germ cells. Altering epigenetic activity during this period could have catastrophic effects on the next generation. Imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation are two areas of particular concern, as these two processes rely on the activity of DNMTs and HDACs (among other enzymes).  <br /></div>
