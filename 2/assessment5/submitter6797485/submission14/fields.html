    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:

    <div class="field-value">The degree of DNA methylation in CpG islands in promoter regions determines the expression of the subsequent genes. <br />Normally, CpG island are protected from methylation. Methylation means silencing of gene expression. <br />There are 2 ways how me-CpG leads to silencing of gene expression:<br />1) it can form repressive chromatins structures<br />2) it can avoid binding of transcription factors.<br />In normal cells CpG islands usually are hypomethylated wheras hypermethylation of the CpG islands is associated with cancer. In this case a tumor-suppressor gene is silenced via the methylated promoter region.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and Repetitive elements normally are methylated, this maintains genomic stability. Methylation helps preventing transposition and illegitimate recombination of DNA fragments. In cancer cells deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations are observed, because unmethylated Intergenic regions and Repetitive elements are unprotected. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (Dacogen) is an anti-cancer drug used in chemotherapy and can be classified in 2 categories: <br />1) DNA-demethylation agent <br />Gene expression
            in cells is regulated by DNA methylation.The activity of suppressor genes influences cell division and
            growth. When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division processes get out of control which promotes cancer. Increased DNA methylation leads to blockage of demethylation/interferences of DNA methylation. By this demethylation process, the normal function of the tumor suppressor genes
            is regained and control over cell growth is restored.
        <br />2) Antimetabolite<br />Decitabine is a synthetical nucleosid and acts as analogon of cytidin. As Decitabine is very similar to cytidin, it is metabolised in the cell replication process and shows its cytotoxic effect in rapidly duplicating cancer. Cell division is disturbed which leads to death of the cancer cell.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation processes should not be adminstered to younger or pregnant patients. Epigenetic marks could be altered permanently in the following sensitive periods:<br />1) younger patients: early life-development <br />2) pregnant women: Early embryonic reprogramming and primordial germ cell development<br /><br />The following mechanisms have to be considered<br />- Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through gametes.<br />- Environmental influence on epigenetic control during sensitive periods of exposure (mitotic heritability)<br />- Incomplete epigenetic reprogramming<br /><br /></div>
