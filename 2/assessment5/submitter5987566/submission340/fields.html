    <div class="field-value">Abberant epigenetic control can infulence all of the hallmarks of 
cancer, and some of them are the evasion of the growth suppressors and 
genome instability. One specific epigenetic modification is DNA methylation. In comparison to normal cells, the malignant cells
                     demonstrate major disruptions in their DNA methylation patterns. These
disruptions/alterations of epigenetic patterns could arise
stochastically due to loss of fidelity or mutation of epigenetic enzymes.  In <b>normal</b> cells, DNA methylation at CpG islands (which are usually <i>unmethylated</i>) is associated with silencing (inactivation) of gene expression. In <b>cancer</b> cells, we can observe the DNA <i>hypermethylation</i> of CpG islands of underlying genes (tumour suppressor genes), which are then silenced. On the other hand, in <b>normal</b> cells, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements (which are usually <i>methylated</i>) is associated with maintaining genomic stability. In <b>cancer</b> cells, we can observe the DNA <i>hypomethylation</i> of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Such hypomethylation leads to genomic instability, which include illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Also, in <b>cancer</b> cells we can observe <i>hypomethylation</i> of CpG poor promoters, which are less common and can result in activation of genes (oncogenes). So, to conclude, in <b>cancer</b>, we see <i>hypomethylation genome-wide</i>, but <i>hypermethylation of tumour suppressors</i>. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer and is in fact often seen in pre-neoplastic tissues. In<b> normal</b> cells, on the <b><i>paternal</i></b><i> </i>allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is<i> methylated</i> which blocks the binding of an insulator protein, CTCF. Without, CTCF DNA methylation spreads to <i>H19</i> promoter and silences it, and the enhancers can access (and <i>activate</i>) the <i>Igf2</i>. On the<i> maternal </i>allele, the ICR is <i>unmethylated</i>, on which then the CTCF can bind. That prevents the enhancers from activating <i>Igf2</i> (<i>not active</i>), but they are free to act on <i>H19</i> and enhance its expression. In <b>Wilm's tumour</b>, we can see the <i>hypermethylation</i> of ICR and the overexpression of <i>Igf2</i>, meaning that on the maternal allele we also have the expression of <i>Igf2</i>. <em>Igf2</em> contributes to cancer due to his major role, that of growth promotion.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine,
FDA approved and sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, is used to treat myelodysplastic
syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. This drug affects the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) which<b> </b>catalyze the transfer of a methyl group to DNA,<b> </b>so the class this drug belongs to is called <strong>DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs)</strong>. It is a nucleoside analogue, that <em>irreversibly binds DNMTs</em> after they are incorporated into DNA and is replication dependent. This results in consequent hypomethylation of DNA, which is hypermethylated in cancer cells. Also, since it is replication dependent, the cancer cells will be more severely affected, because they are replicating more. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation may be considered as a fundamental epigenetic barrier that guides differentiation, but also prevents regression into an undifferentiated 
state. But, DNA methylation marks (and all other epigenetic marks) must be removed between generations to restore totipotency and then laid down again. Such clearing and resetting, i.e. reprogramming, happens in two waves, during <i>primordial germ cell development</i> and <i>early development</i>. These two waves of epigenetic reprogramming are <em>sensitive periods</em>, i.e. these periods are sensitive to epigenetic disruptions. In the epigenetic reprogramming during germ cell development it is needed to remove the somatic marks and lay down 
the epigenetic signatures required for a particular germ cell. So, treating younger cancer patients during that sensitive period, i.e. during the germ cell development would be inadvisable, because of the possible effect of the drug on the epigenetic reprogramming.<br /></div>
