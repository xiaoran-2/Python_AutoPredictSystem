    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is one of the most common epigenetic alterations found in mammals and generally acts to repress gene activity. The distribution of methylation is not constant throughout the genome, however. Normally, the DNA of CpG islands is unmethylated, while that of repetitive elements and intergenic regions exhibits a great deal of methylation. This pattern is dramatically altered in cancer - CpG islands exhibit more methylation, while other parts of the genome are less methylated. This hypomethylation has long been recognized as an attribute of cancer cells.<br /><br />CpG islands, which are often located at promoters, are thought to be protected from methylation. Methylation of these areas causes the genes controlled by these promoters to be silenced. This would include genes that constrain cell growth and division, as well as those that regulate programmed cell death.  In fact, this type of alteration in the methylation of CpG islands (known as CIMP) is used as a diagnostic marker for colorectal (and to some degree other) forms of cancer<br /><br />Methylation of DNA in intergenic regions may serve to stabilize the genome, protecting it from undergoing chromosomal abnormalities such as deletions, duplications, insertions or translocations. In repetitive elements, methylation can preserve the genome from  illegitimate recombination. It can also serve to silence repeats, which can avoid transposition or interference. Another activity for methylation of intergenic regions arises from the fact that methylated cytosine can be converted into thymine relatively easily. Such mutation would also prevent transposition. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an anticancer drug that acts as a DNA demethylating agent. Although lower - than - normal levels of methylation are generally associated with the development of cancer, in some cases methylation may be positively associated with disease. In these instances, methylation is inhibiting the activity of a gene or genes that would normally regulate or suppress cell division and growth. Therefore, removal of methylation would allow cancer suppressive genes to be activated. This has been demonstrated for haematological malignancies.<br /><br />This drug acts act by inhibiting the action DNA methyltransferase (see <span><a title="Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine</a></span>). Since they are replication-dependent, the rapidly multiplying cancer cells are more affected by agents targeting this enzyme than are normal cells. They can be administered at lower doses than traditional chemotherapy agents and are generally well-tolerated by those taking them.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in normal imprinting patterns at the imprint control
regions (IRCs) can influence the development of cancer. One gene for which this
has been demonstrated is Igf2, which is located on chromosome 11 and has been shown to be associated with Wilm's tumor. <br /></p><p>The normal
situation is that, for the maternal chromosome, the ICR in the cluster
containing Igf2 is unmethylated and is thus able to bind a protein called 
CTCF.  The bound CTCF "insulates" Igf2 from the action of downstream enhancers. The enhances then act on H19 via a process known as chromatin looping, which serves to increase H19 expression.. Conversely, in this region on the paternal chromosome, the IRC is methylated so CTCF cannot protect Igf2 from the enhancers. Additionally, H19 is not active. Therefore, under the normal situation, Igf2 is only paternally-produced while H19 is only maternally-produced..<br /><br />
In Wilm's tumor, the paternal imprinting is lost - the maternal chromosome
exhibits the same state as the paternal chromosome. The consequence of this is an overproduction of Igf2, causing unchecked growth. Additionally, activity of Cdkn1c, which would normally regulate the cell cycle and inhibit growth, is blocked by imprinting disruption in the Kcnq1 cluster.<br /></p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">One of the key features of epigenetics is the concept of mitotic heritability - once a change has been made to a cell, all the daughter cells of that cell will express that change. Therefore, any drug that changed the methylation status of a tumor cell such that its fitness was reduced would demonstrate effectiveness even after the treatment period had concluded.<br /><br />Care should be taken that treatments administered to negatively impact the epigenome of the tumor do not have a similar impact on the patient.  There are stages during the development of an organism where it is critical that the correct epigenetic marks are laid down - the sensitive periods. Sensitive periods would include the early stages of embryo development and the period in which an organism is producing its primordial germ cells. These are stages that are intimately associated with development, rather that maintenance.  Treatments which negatively impact the setting of normal epigenetic marks could damage critical gene expression levels that would persist throughout the generations of the daughter cells affected.  Epigenetic changes to gametes could cause these effects to persist into the next generation.<br /></div>
