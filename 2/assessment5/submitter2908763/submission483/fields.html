    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation of DNA at CPG islands results in repression of expression of the surrounding genes, it is associated with gene silencing. In cancer, there is a general hypermethylation of the CPG islands in the genome, resulting in suppression expression of the surrounding genes. In many cases, this hypermethylation results in the silencing of tumour suppressor genes that were previously expressed, leading to the development of cancer.<br />Methylation of DNA at repetitive elements and intergenic regions is to suppress the expression of the surrounding DNA and genes. In cancer, there is a generalized hypomethylation of DNA at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This hypomethylation results in genomic instability and the expression of previously silenced genes, including oncogenes, leading to the development of cancer.       <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genetic imprinting is parent of origin-based silencing of one of the two alleles, leading to the expression of one of the alleles. On the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele has its imprint control region (ICR) hypermethylated and therefore the CTCF can not bind to it, and this allows the enhancers to aid the expression of the Igf2 gene on the paternal allele. On the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated and is bound by the CTCF, this will make the enhancers aid the expression of the H19 gene. <br />In Wilm's tumour, the ICRs on both maternal and paternal alleles are hypermethylated, making the enhancers to aid the expression of Igf2 from both alleles, while silencing the H19 gene on both alleles, leading to cancer.    <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an epigenetic drug belonging to the group DNA demethylating agents. These agents remove methyl groups on the DNA, causing hypomethylation. This property of causing a generalized hypomethylation in the DNA can be used in the treatment of cancers. Decitabine can be used to induce hypomethylation in the hypermethylated CPG islands, allowing the expression of tumour suppressor genes that will inhibit tumour growth and proliferation.   <br /><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation in the genome is mitotically heritable in the cells through the function of DNMT1. DNMT1 methylates newly transcribed DNA strands, maintaining DNA methylation. Epigenetic drugs that target DNMTs will prevent methylation of the new strands and there by diluting the DNA methylation in the genome of the cells and therefore allowing suppressed tumour suppressors to be expressed. <br />Sensitive period is the period during which the epigenetic marks are removed and then re-set again. Two sensitive periods have been identified: during pre-implantation (after fertilization) and during primordial germ-cell development (gamatogenesis). It is not advisable to treat patients during these periods because any epigenetic mark that is established or removed will be maintained in the patient, many of which would be detrimental to the normal development of the patient.   <br /></div>
