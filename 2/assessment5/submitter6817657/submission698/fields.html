    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the 'normal' cell, there is hypomethylation of the CpG islands, which allows downstream genes to be expressed.  In the cancer cell, there is an increase in methylation of the CpG islands.  This hypermethylation suppresses the expression of downstream genes.  If a downstream gene is a tumor suppressor, then this gene will NOT be expressed allowing a cancer cell to develop.<br /><br />Normally, the intergenic region an repetitive elements are methylated.  The methylation of these areas of the genome help to maintain the stability of the genome.  That is, it prevents the loss or gain of genetic material through deletions, insertions, or reciprocal translocations.  In a cancer cell, demethylation occurs within these regions.  By removing the methyl groups, these regions become unstable allowing for the loss and gain of genetic material.  Also, removal of the methyl groups allows the activation of repeats, which can be copied and moved, along with the activation of cryptic promoters and neighboring genes.  In addition, the removal of these methyl groups can result in the loss of imprinting, which can cause the deregulation of tissue specific genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the normal cell, the methylation pattern of the paternal and maternal allele for the ICR that controls Igf2 expression is different.  In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, which directs the enhancers to act on Igf2 causing its expression.  In the maternal allele, the ICR is NOT methylated, which directs the enhancers to act on H19 rather than on Igf2, resulting in the silencing of Igf2.  <br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, there is a loss of imprinting resulting in the methylation of the maternal ICR.  The methylation of the maternal ICR causes the enhancers to act on Igf2, thereby increasing the expression of Igf2.  The cell is now expressing Igf2 from both the paternal and maternal alleles greatly increasing the amount of growth factor in the cell.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA methyl transferase inhibitors (DNMTi).  This class of inhibitors prevents the methylation of DNA.  As described above in Questions 1 and 2, there is a change in the methylation patterns in cancer cells, with cancer cells tending towards a global increase in methylation.  Decitabine, which inhibits DNA methylation, may return a cancer towards it normal methylation status.  By reducing the methylation of the CpG islands and their shores, it may be possible to increase, that is, 'reactivate', the expression of tumor suppressor genes to 'normal' levels.   </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In general, epigenetic marks, especially DNA methylation, are mitotically inheritable.  That is, the epigenetic mark is passed from one cell generation to the next.  If the epigenetic marks in a cancer cell are altered through treatment with a compound such as Decitabine, these 'new' epigenetic marks will passed to the next generation cells, which had not been exposed to Decitabine.  A sensitive period, with regard to epigenetics, is considered to be the time period during which epigenetic marks are either made or cleared (reprogramming).  During embryonic development, a sensitive period occurs during the early stages through the development of the blastocyst and later during the development of the primordial germ cells.  A sensitive period also occurs during early adolescence (ages 8 - 12) when germ cells are maturing.  Treating a patient during a sensitive period would affect not only the tumor cells, but also a large number of non-tumor cells and tissues.  Since the epigenetic drugs affect the epigenetic marks, any changes in 'normal' cells and tissues could last for a lifetime.</div>
