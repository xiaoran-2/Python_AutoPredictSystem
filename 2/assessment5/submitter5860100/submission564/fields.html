    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster the paternal allele ICR is imprinted and methylated. The insulator protein CTCF can not bind to the methylated ICR and downstream enhancers are free to loop to the Igf2 gene and Igf2 is expressed in the paternal allele. Because of methylation spreading the H19 promoter is silenced and there is no H19 expression. The maternal allele ICR is not imprinted and is not methylated. It is therefore bound by CTCF which blocks the Igf2 site from downstream enhancers. Igf2 is not expressed by the maternal allele. In addition, the enhancers can loop to the H19 promoter and H19 is expressed in the maternal allele. In Wilm's tumor there is hypermethylation and loss of imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster with expression of both maternal and paternal alleles. There is therefore overexpression of Igf2 and proliferation of growth enhanced tumor development. If you disrupt imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster by hypermethylation you will have loss of imprinting. Both the paternal and maternal Igf2 alleles will be expressed giving a double dose of Igf2 which is a growth promoter. It will act as a oncogene and promote cancer growth and contribute to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation which allows expression of associated genes. It is thought that over half of genes in humans use CpG islands as promoters to initiate transcription. In cancer CpG island promoter sites become hypermethylated which silences the corresponding gene. This inhibits expression and transcription of the gene because the CpG island promoter region is silenced. The hypermethylation of CpG islands can lead to silencing of tumor suppressor genes which leads to shutting  off the cells mechanism for preventing cancer. Genes controlling DNA repair mechanisms, cell cycle, and apoptosis can be silenced which will contribute to cancer. P53 a cell-cycle inhibitor is often disrupted by hypermethylation. These epigenetic mark changes are copied by DNMT1 and passed on to the replicated daughter cells. These increasing aberrant changes to the epigenome contributes to cancer.  In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements usually are methylation.  This is to keep these areas silenced so they do not cause instability and possible mutations. In cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated.  This hypomethylation can lead these areas to become active and able to be expressed when they should be silenced.  This can lead to activation of repetitive element DNA and also loss of imprinting. The disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can lead to deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations. Transposing of repetitive elements into other genes can wrongly activate genes or disrupt the coding regions of normal genes. Hypomethylation of repeats can lead to oncogene activation. The above events can lead to widespread instability in the epigenome and genome with possible mutations in DNA sequences.  All of which would contribute to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitors. They are small molecule inhibitor's that target epigenetic enzymes. Decitabine is a Nucleoside analog. Decitabine targets DNMT(DNA Methyltransferase) and inhibits the enzyme. They work by being incorporated into the DNA as an analog instead of the normal nucleoside during replication. When DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand it is irreversibly bound and can not be released. The cells have to be replicating and the methylation will be diluted out. Cancer cells multiply rapidly so these demethylations would dominate with multiple replications. Because of hypermethylation in tumors it would work by demethylating different CpG  islands allowing them to promote their associated genes. This would be especially true for tumor suppressor genes which would be able to work against the tumor. It works well against Myelodysplastic syndrome and is synergistic with standard chemo.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have an enduring effect in the epigenome because alterations can be maintained and can be passed down to daughter cells. DNMT1 is used as a maintenance methyltransferase and can recognize and methylate hemimethylated CpG's.  The DNA methylation patterns on the parent strand are copied to the daughter strands during DNA replication in mitosis. The epigenetic marks are mitotically stable and heritable and are therefore enduring.  Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming and active remodeling of epigenetic marks. During these periods the epigenome is susceptible to aberrant incorrect marks being laid down where they should not be. The preimplantation period in early fetal development is a sensitive period because there is removal of methyl marks for reprograming. Also, primordial germ cell development is a sensitive period. The somatic epigenetic marks are removed and specific marks for germ cell chromatin have to be laid down. It would be inadvisable to treat younger patients during the sensitive period of germ cell development. Reprograming and imprinting in germ cells could be disrupted and passed on to their children. Also, it would be inadvisable to treat women who could become pregnant because there is epigenetic reprograming in early fetal development.</div>
