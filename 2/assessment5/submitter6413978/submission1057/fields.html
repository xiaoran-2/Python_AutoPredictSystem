    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is found in 70-80%CpG islands. Changes in DNA methylation include genome wide loss and local hyper methylation, both of which can contribute to cancer in different ways.<br />-hypermethylation of promotors of tumor suppressor genes or CpG island shores leads to their inactivation causing tumorigenesis.<br />-likewise hypomethylation of CpG islands in inter genie regions or repeats leads to genomic instability and increased risk of cancer<br />Normally, DNA methylation at intergenic and repetitive elements prevent them from forming transposons, which can jump and insert into various parts of DNA. This can potentially disrupt a tumor suppressor gene or activate an oncogene, when in their vicinity, and can lead to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally expressed and maternally imprinted.<br />DNA methylation at ICR of H19/igf2 cluster  is enhancer blocking, I.e blocks CTCF binding which causes DNA methylation to spread to H19 promotor and silence it. Now enhancer scan access and activate igf2. This can happen only in paternal allele in normal circumstances. In maternal allele, CTCF can bind to ICR, preventing access of enhancers to igf2, thereby causing its lack of expression of igf2. This is called imprinting.<br />when this imprinting process is maternal allele is disrupted, it behaves similar to paternal allele, which results in nbeckwith Weismann syndrome. Since Igf2 is growth promoting, ie behaves like oncogene and double expression can lead to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Azacitidine and decitabine belong to a class of epicene tic inhibitors called DNA demethylating agents. They are mainly used to treat MDS, a precursor of AML, which occurs in elderly.<br />Decitabine causes decreased methylation of the hyper methylated regions of DNA (CpG clusters near promotors of tumor suppressor genes) and since DNA methylation and demethylation are stable mitotically heritable states, the daughter cells have hypo methylated cells. This is abiding by the concept that perhaps hypomethylation causes restoration of tumor suppressor activity, thereby preventing potential development/progression to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes are mitotically inheritable and passed on through cell division<span> to daughter and granddaughter cells until further changes occur. Therefore,epigenetic therapies aim at modifying cells which prevent cancer growth but does not actively kill cells. <br /></span>Sensitive periods are periods during the growth of an individual when the cells are extremely sensitive to epigenetic modifications. <br />Early embryonic period and gamete phase are considered to be sensitive periods as all epigenetic marks on genome, in general(with exceptions of imprinted genes etc.) would be erased and reformed later. Once present, they are mitotically heritable through the life of organism.<br />treating patients during sensitive periods can have long lasting undesirable effects on the various cells of body by inadvertent methylation or hypomethylation, which causes genomic instability and cancer in short or long term.</div>
