    <div class="field-value">The DNA methylation process is the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine DNA nucleotides. It usually occurs in 5' groups of cytosines of CpG dinucleotides which are clustered into CpG islands nearby genes promoters. Normally these regions are unmethylated, one of the reasons can be that methylcytosines are prone to deamination to T (thymine) DNA nucleotides, (it could be a mutation problem).The location of CpGIs in the promoters allows the control of activation and silencing gene expression. <br />Methylation is associated with gene silencing. Because of this, in cancer, CpGIs are frequently hypermethylated, especially, in promoters of tumour suppressor genes. It has often seen in tumours, even though it varies by tumour type, therefore, it can be considered one of the hits in the Knudson Hypothesis.<br />On the other hand, the promoter regions of the oncogenes are poor methylated in normal cells, if they loose those marks it can result in the activation of those genes which are often growth control genes. <br />The methylation process is mitotically heritable and if the combination of both facts: silencing of tumour suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes is added, it can result in the enhancement of tumorigenesis. <br /><br />However, other places in the genome such as intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated in order to maintain genomic integrity. These marks avoid the transposition of the Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) and the possibility of transcriptional interference from strong promoters, besides they can prevent the illegitimate recombination. But, in cancer, the methylation marks are lost in these regions,and the genomic stability is compromised it has seen in cancer cells chromosomes with different problems like deletions of some parts, reciprocal translocations and insertions because of the transposition of these repetitive elements, it can activate critic promoters and genes which should be silenced.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/igf2 cluster is located in the chromosome 11.Both genes are involved in the growth control of cells. There is a differential epigenomic imprinting between the two heritable alleles. In the paternal allele the ICR region is methylated and it is spread to the H19 promoter, because of this, the CTCF protein which is an insulator protein cannot join the ICR and the enhancers located downstream H19 gene can only access to Igf2 gene allowing its expression. However, in the maternal allele occurs the way around. The ICR region is unmethylated which allows the union of CTCF protein, this union blocks the action of the downstream enhancers on Igf2 expression and they only can actuate on H19 gene expression. <br />Moreover, It has been found in Wilm's tumour which is a childhood kidney tumour, a loss of imprinting in this cluster in pre-neoplastic tissue. In these cells the maternal allele behaves as the paternal allele, that is, the ICR region is now hypermethylated blocking the union of CTCF factor and allowing the action of the enhancers on Igf2 gene, this duplicates the Igf2 dosis permitting the free growth and division of the cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is classified as a DNA-demethylating agent and it is used in myelodysplastic syndromes treatment. Specifically is a DNMT1 inhibitor and chemically is a nucleoside analog which means it can be incorporated into DNA when it is being replicate. When DNMT1 actuates over the new DNA strand to maintain the methylated patron, it joins the Decitabine nucleoside irreversibly and the novo methylation does not occur. <br />This therapy only can have its effect if the cell is dividing in that moment, luckily, it is a typical feature of cancer cells. The blockage of the novo methylation process prevents the mitotic heritability of this mark in the daughter cells, and it would allow getting back the normal cell epiphenotype.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Aside from genomic alterations, there are also epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation which can determine the outcome of the cell. The methylation in the DNA specific regions as CpGIs and ICRs acts as a silence mark which controls the expression of the genes and maintains the normal function of the cell. The alteration of these marks can contribute to an uncontrolled state and to the start of a tumour process. <br /><br />In the development of an organism exists what is called sensitive periods where the epigenetic reprogramming occurs and the epigenetic marks are established rather than maintained. These periods are the early embryo development and the primordial germ cells development. In the first one exists DNA demethylation before the blastocyst formation, then are reestablished the epigenetic marks tissue specific and maintained mitotically in the somatic cells. Besides, the imprinted genes must remain silenced in their parent-of-origin state until the next period where the imprinted marks are removed and reestablished depending on the sex of the individual in the germ cells. For this reasons, the alteration of DNA methylation during these periods can affect not only the person who is receiving the treatment, but her descendants too.  </div>
