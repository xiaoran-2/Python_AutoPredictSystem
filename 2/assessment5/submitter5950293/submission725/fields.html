    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic
marks in the genome can lead to silencing or expression of a gene.
With mitosis these marks are inherited by the cell and thus each cell
type expresses only the genes necessary for maintaining the function
of this particular cell type e. g. during differentiation the gene
for hemoglobin is active in red blood cells, for myoglobin in muscles
cells.  In the genome of mammals the dinucleotide CpG is almost
exclusively methylated and this occurs symmetrically in the
complement DNA strands. Two enzymes DNMT 3a and DNMT3b lay down de
novo methylation of the DNA, whilst DNMT1 is responsible for
maintaining the methyl groups during mitosis. There are CpG rich
regions in the genome, clusters, called CpG islands,  often in the
promotor region of genes; In normal tissue CpG islands tend to be
unmethylated and 5mC, which is  not part of CpG islands is
genome-wide methylated. Methylation of these epigenetic marks in the
genome can lead to silencing or expression of a gene.</p><p> 
During the development of cancer
more and more CpG islands get methylated. If the promotor region of
tumour suppressor is methylated in cancer, they are silenced. Tumour
suppressor genes can no longer fulfill their function, enabling
cancer to proceed.</p><p>

</p><p>So
in cancer  CpG islands become hypermethylated and genome-wide
methylation of 5mC decreases: The methylation of the genome in
intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements diminishes with
the progressing of cancer. The DNA methylation of these regions
(intergenic regions and repetitive elements) is required for the
stability of the genome and normal development repetitive elements stay methylated.   Hypomethylation in repetitive  elements
leads to genomic instability and cancer can follow.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>e.g.
Hypermethylation of ICR, Igf2 overexpression in Wilm’s tumour 
</p>
<p>In
the imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster the maternal allele is
silenced, the paternal allele is expressed.</p>
<p>In
the
paternal allele the ICR is methylated. CTCF cannot bind, then
methylation spreads to the promotor region of H19. The downstream
enhancers are not blocked and can activate Igf2.</p>
<p>
In
the maternal allele the Imprint control region is not methylated,
enabling the CTCF to bind. CTCF is
an insulator protein: it insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers,
which activate the expression of
H19. In case there is no imprinting, e.g. a hypermethylation at the
ICR (Wilm´s tumour) , the insulator protein cannot bind to the ICR, we have two
paternally expressed alleles. The enhancers are not blocked like it
would normally happen in the maternal allele and the Igf2 is
overexpressed in Wilm`s tumour. Growth promoting genes are
overexpressed leading to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>
Decitabine
belongs to DNA-demethylating agents, to the class of DNMT inhibitors,
that are  DNA methyl transferase inhibitors. Decitabine changes
methylation pattern by decreasing the number of methyl residues of
the DNA by inhibiting the enzyme DNMT; it can have an effect on the
methylation of the CpG islands by demethylating them, as during the
development of cancer more and more get methylated. In the promotor
region of tumour suppressor genes which can be methylated in cancer,
thus silencing the tumour supressor genes. Tumour suppressor genes
can no longer fulfill their function, enabling cancer to proceed.
Decitabine might block the  DNMTs from methylating  the promotor
region of tumour suppressor genes, thus they can work as tumor
supressor genes. Cancer can be stopped by removing the
hypermethylation   of the CpG islands in tumour suppressor genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA-methylation
pattern is inheritated by each somatic cell during mitosis. The
methylation pattern of each DNA strand is complemented (CpG
dinucleotides on one strand, GpC dinucleotide on the other strand).</p>
<p>During
a sensitive period epigenetic marks are established, e.g. during
early devopment (embryogenesis) and during primordial germ cell
development; in these sensitive periods epigenetic marks are cleared
and reprogrammed. Epigenetic reprogramming and genomic imprinting of either the maternal or paternal gene occurs. If a drug that alters methylation is given in such
a period it can do harm to the persons´s germ cells or during early
embryo development. Thus imprinting of genes might be disturbed during primordial germ cell development. Failure in the imprinting of genes can be lethal.</p></div>
