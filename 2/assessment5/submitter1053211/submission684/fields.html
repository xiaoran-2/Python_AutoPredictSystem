    <h1>Submission 684 from Anon (session_user_id: 115f381ec6ca681dcf2ca70f84aa1e2ade539ccc)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, it can be used to prevent the excess accumulation of methyl groups and thus prevent the  overmethylation of DNA. As certain cancers result from overmethylation, and thus silencing, of genes involved in tumor suppression, Decitabine can act to restore proper expression of these tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. In cancer cells, promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated (dependent on tumor subtypes) and increases over time, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene, which in the case of cancer, tend to be the promoters of cancer suppressor genes. Intragenic regions and  repetitive sequences tend to be methylated in normal DNA whereby it helps maintain genomic stability via intragenic regions and silencing of cryptic promoters and/or splice sites found in repetitive sequences. In cancer, unmethylation, or hypomethylation occurs in these regions caused by passive and active demethylation. This demethylation results in a loss of genome integrity and stability. In particular loss of methylation at repetitive elements allows for transposition events, expression from their promoters which can come on and stay on, thus expressing genes that normally shold be silent and allow for illegimate recombination between repeats in the genome. This can lead to chromosome deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele, methylation allows for enhancers to act on Igf2 and allow expression. On the maternal allele, normally a lack of methylation allows the protein CTCF to bind to the non-methylated region and block enhancer effect on Igf2, thus blocking its expression. So normally, Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele and not the maternal one. The imprinting of this cluster can be disrupted by mutations or deletions which causes the maternal allele to act like the paternal one. Or in a situation where Uniparental disomy occurs and two copies of the paternal chromosomes (11) are inherited or in rare cases, something causes a epigenetic disruption and thus loss of imprinting. As Igf2 is a growth promoter during fetal and childhood development, it's overexpression results in uncontrolled division of certain cells, in particular those of the kidney.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since epigenomic marks, such as DNA methylation, are carried over during cell division, any alterations caused by a drug treatment to the epigenome of a cell, will be passed on. There are periods when treating a patient with such drugs should be avoided and are referred to as sensitive periods. These are events where active remodeling of the epigenome occurs (these are primordial germ cell development to the production of mature egg and sperm, as well as pre- and post implantation periods, gametes-fertilized egg-blastocyst-epiblast). So during these period of actively removing and laying down new epigenetic marks, drugs would cause unwanted alterations to the epigenome.</div>
