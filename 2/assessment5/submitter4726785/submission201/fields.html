    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cell DNA methylation at  CpG islands are hypomethylated, &amp; the intergenic rgions, repetitive elements are hypermethylated. In cancer cell DNA methylation of CpG islands hypermethylated and in intergenic regions, repetitive elements are hypomethylated.Transcriptional repression, loss of TSG(tumor supressor gene) expression becomes cancer and rapid tumerogenesis. In other regions normally hypermethylated at these sites are associated with greater genomic stability, so hypomethylation during cancer leads to copying errors such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the chromosomes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal  cell methylation occurs around the H19/Igf2 locus of the paternal allele at the ICR(Imprint control regions), and no methylation for the maternal allele. the CTCF complex(it is a Transcriptional repressor protien) binds to the allele on the maternal strand and the down stream enhancers act on H19 as a result. The CTCF complex doesnt bind to the paternal allele due to the methyl marks, which leads to silencing of the H19 gene as the enhancers instead drive expression of Igf2. Thus, in a regular cell you observe a normal dose of both H19 from maternal strand, and Igf2 from paternal strand. However, when this ICR becomes hypermethylated, both strands appear to be of paternal origin and get expressed as such . So  the system gets a double dose(growth-promoting) Igf2 (as well as no dose of H19). This associated with Wilm's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine beongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. Decitabine  contributes to hypomethylation of DNA. This useful in treating MDS(myelodysplastic syndrome).which is a precursor of AML ( acute myelogenic leaukemia). In this case of Decitabine , the anti-tumor effect has been linked to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor supressor gens, induced by the hypomethylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a special  form of regulation to target in treatment beacuase it can be changed , and enduring effects are ensured as the DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis. How ever these global interventions may interfere with ordinary functioning of the system, especially during critical periods-- periods of time where extensive epigenetic reprograming occurs.  it would not be used or treated  to pregnant mothers (including a few months before conception) as a lot of reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the formation of gametes(male and female)</div>
