    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><div>In normal conditions, cells don't usually show methylation in CpG islands. In other genomic contexts, instead, as for example repetitive elements, introns and intergenic regions, genome is generally methylated. </div><div>In a cancer cell, in opposition to normal conditions, it can be see a switch of these methylation conditions, as CpG islands appear more methylated than in a non cancer cell (CGI hypermethilation), and the other regions named above show hypomethilation.</div><div>The methylation of CpG islands can be a crucial event to develop tumor, due to their localization, for example in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes.</div><div>The epigenetic silencing of these genes can contribute to develop a positive selection of cells harboring this state, because they can divide more rapidly than normal cells or have a major resistance to death, expanding therefore mitotically more then normal cells.</div><div>In addition, the hypomethilation of some repetitive elements and intergenic regions found in cancer cells can contribute to genomic instability, and it was found progressing with tumor progression. Genomic instability can be due, for example, to reciprocal recombination between repeats that align and recombine. To avoid this event, these regions are usually highlhy methylated, so not available as open chromatin because packaged. In a cancer cell, alignment and reciprocal recombination is possible due to hypomethylation of these regions.</div><div>In addition, some transposable elements, usually methylated in a normal conditions, in cancer cells can be reactivated and transpose from one genomic region to another, then causing for example gene interruption, and more in general genomic instability.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The gene cluster H19/Igf2 belongs to an imprinted control region (ICR),  namely a DNA sequence differentially methylated on the two parental allele. This cluster contains the IGF2 gene and the H19 sequence, and in addition binding sites for the insulator protein CTCF. The<span> DNA coding for the long noncoding RNA <i>H19</i> is methylated only on the paternal allele. </span>Methylation of the paternal Imprinted control region avoid the binding to the CTCF protein to the binding sites, then avoiding CTCF to insulates Igf2 from the enhancers sequences located in the region. As consequences, enhancers can act to Igf2 activating its expression, and DNA methylation spread over the H19 promoter, silencing its transcription. In the unmethylated maternal ICR, CTCF elements can bind to theirs unmethylated binding sites in the region and act as insulators on Igf2 gene from the enhancers located downstream the H19 sequence. The Igf2 is then no longer active, and enhancers act on H19, permitting its expression.In Wilm's tumor, a loss of imprinting (LOI) occurs in the IGF2/H19 cluster, resulting in a maternal chromosome epigenetically similar to the paternal chromosome, harboring methylation on H19 promoter and IGF2 expression. The over expression of IGF2 causes then exacerbated cell growth.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, and it is now used to treat myelodisplastic syndrome progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. This molecule, being a nucleoside analog, is incorporated in DNA sequence during its replication. When DNA methyltransferase reach the DNA position where the molecule is incorporated, it is irreversible linked and cannot act anymore. DNA methyltransferase act in daughter cells to reproduce methylation state identical to that of mother cell, so it is particularly active in highly dividing cells, as in tumors. <p>The myelodysplastic syndrome appear dependent on CpG island hypermethylation, so the inhibition of methylation via decitabine is a opportune way to block the tumor.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Molecules acting as DNA methylatransferase inhibitors, for example Decitabine, are able to incorporate in DNA sequence during its replication. This action permit to daughter cells to receive the same molecule from mother cell, then expanding the effect of the drug over the period of treatment. </p><p>It should be considered to avoid treatment with these drugs in specific periods of development of the human life, recognized as “sensitive periods” where  the epigenetic machinery needs to work to reorganize the epigenetic reprogramming, by clearing the epigenetic marks. In this context, the two sensitive periods of development of germ cells and early embryonic development should be avoided.</p>
<p>Treatment of patients with molecules able to alterate DNA methylation should interfere with reorganization of methylation during these sensitive periods, leading to an aberrant methylation pattern.</p></div>
