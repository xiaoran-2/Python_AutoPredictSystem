    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are normally located at promoters of genes. The methylation of these CpG islands leads to the silencing of gene expression of the genes downstream of the promoter region. Normally, these CpG islands are unmethylated,  however if certain CpG islands upstream of for example tumor supressor genes are methylated, this can contribute to the cell developing into a cancer cell. In contrast, some CpG islands upstream of oncogenes, that are normally methylated, can become hypomethylated and thus lead to activation of gene expression of the oncogene.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements, in contrast to CpG islands, are generally methylated. Methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements have been proposed to contribute to genomic integrity. For example for repetitive elements, methylation can help with the silencing of these repeats to prevent transposition and also to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters.<br />In cancers, some of these intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, which leads to genomic instability, by allowing recombination between repeats, by activating repeats and transpositions, and by activating cryptic promoters and disrupting neighbouring genes. However, some regions can also by hypermethylated, leading to supression of tumor supressor genes, thus allowing the cell to develop into a cancer cell.<br /><br />In summary, different types of cancer requires different kinds of methylation patterns, however, generally, genome-wide hypomethylation tends to occur, as well as hypermethylation of CpG islands.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster contains an imprint control region (ICR) that is un-methylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele, meaning that it is paternally imprinted. On the maternal allele, the ICR is un-methylated and is bound by an insulator protein called CTCF, that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Furthermore, since the ICR is un-methylated, a downstream non-coding RNA is expressed, H19, that leads to expression of the pre-mentioned enhancers. Since Igf2 is insulated, it is not expressed from the maternal allele.<br />In contrast, on the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, which means that CTCF can not bind to the ICR and insulate Igf2. Since the enhancers expressed by H19 expression favor the binding of Igf2, these enhancers will then increase the expression of Igf2 instead of the non-coding RNA H19, leading to paternal expression of Igf2.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour patients, the paternal and maternal allele ICR in the H19/Igf2 cluster are both hypermethylated. This means that Igf2 expression is increased beyond normal levels, since there is now expression from both the maternal and paternal allele. Igf2 is growth promoting, thus overexpression of Igf2 can lead to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine works be de-methylating DNA, thus it can help with reducing the overmethylation DNA, that can cause some types of cancer. By de-methylating DNA and/or histones, tumor supressor genes that were otherwise epigenetically silenced, can now be activated. This de-methylation thus have an anti-tumour effect, as otherwise silenced tumor supressor genes, can now be expressed again.<br /><br />Actually, researchers have tried treating lung cancer patients with a combination of a histone-deacetylase and a DNA-demethylating agent, with great success. Furthermore, the patients that did not react to the treatment itself, showed good reactions to subsequent chemotherapeutic treatments, indicating that "epigenetic drugs" alter tumor cells in a lasting way that makes them more susceptible to standard treatments.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation patterns, are mitotically heritable. This means that cancer cells treated with for example de-methylating agents, will give rise to daughter cells with increasingly de-methylated DNA. This means that the epigenetic reprogramming caused by the drugs carries on to the next generation of cells, even though that the treatment itself have been stopped. <br /><br />However, there are so-called sensitive periods in epigenetic reprogramming, in which it would be unadvisable to treat cancer patients with epigenetic drugs. These periods are during germ cell development and embryonic development. These periods are sensitive because epigenetic reprogramming are occuring intrinsically in these periods, meaning that the treatment itself can interfere with normal epigenetic reprogramming. <br />Therefore it would be unadvisable to treat pregnant women for example, because their child will most likely not be able to undergo normal epigenetic programming, due to us interfering with epigenetic drugs. Since epigenetic reprogramming is such an important period in normal embryonic development, it would most likely lead to disease if this development was disturbed by treating with epigenetic drugs.<br /></div>
