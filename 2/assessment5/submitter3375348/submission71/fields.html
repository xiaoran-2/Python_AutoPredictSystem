    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are small regions of DNA that are very rich in linked cytosines and guanines and are commonly unmethylated. CpG islands typically occur in the promoter regions of genes, located at the 5' end of the genes. About half of all genes contain a CpG island in their promoter regions. The lack of methylation in CpG islands creates a more open chromatin structure, or euchromatin, allowing for active gene expression. The methylation of unmethylated CpG islands causes genes that are needed for proper cell growth control to be silenced and is a mechanism in the development of many types of cancer via the silencing of tumor suppressor genes or tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation. <br /><br />In contrast, the genome is commonly methylated in the intergenic regions, repetitive elements and even introns in normal cells. This creates a more densely packed chromatin structure, or heterochromatin, and genomic stability. However, in a cancer cell, these intergenic regions, repetitive elements and introns, are more likely to be unmethylated or hypomethylated, leading to genomic instability and aberrant DNA repair. In addition, hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters leads to the activation of oncogenes. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes in DNA methylation at imprint control regions (ICRs) can result in the either the loss of expression of growth restricting genes, or the overexpression of growth promoting genes. This is commonly seen in early pre-neoplastic tissue and a wide array of tumor types. <br /><br />At the H19/IGF2 cluster, the ICR is normally methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it is unmethylated, the insulator protein CTCF binds its insulator element, and the enhancers in this case will act on H19. The expression of IGF2 will be silent for the maternal allele. Because the paternal allele is methylated, the enhancers can act on IGF2 because CTCF is not binding to inhibit this, and IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele. However, with loss of imprinting, you have methylation of H19 and expression of IGF2 on the maternal allele as well. This gives a double dose of IGF2 compared to what you see in a normal cell. <br /><br />Loss of imprinting of the H19/IGF2 domain is a common feature of Wilms tumour. Hypermethylation of H19 can lead to the overexpression of IGF2, a growth promoting gene, which contributes to cancer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an anti-cancer drug that is classified as a DNA-demethylating agent. It works by demethylating or interfering with the methylation of DNA and restoring the function of tumor suppressor genes, thus restoring control of cell growth. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Even though DNA methylation is involved in normal development, aging and 
gene regulation, <em>altered</em> methylation patterns have been linked to 
disease. Reprogramming the epigenetic machinery with drugs can alter the activity or expression of critical genes and therefore even short-term treatment can have long-term effects on patients. It is generally believed that early life - prenatal, infancy and childhood - is a period in which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of
 epigenetic mechanisms. Three developmental 
periods - preconception, preimplantation and gastrulation - appear to be 
particularly sensitive. In younger patients, with or without cancer, the effects of epigenetic drugs on germ cells need to be considered. <br /><br /><br /></div>
