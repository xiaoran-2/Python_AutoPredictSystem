    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a reversible modification of stretches of DNA on CpG islands. CpG islands are formed by a cytosine nucleotide followed by guanine nucleotide where the cytosine can be methylated to recruit DNA binding proteins which only recognize the methylated confirmation such as MeCP proteins (Lecture 1-5). These remodel the chromatin in the region by making it more tightly packaged (Heterochromatin) and transcriptionally silence the gene. CpG islands are mainly protected from methylation in normal tissues, and their methylation implies silencing. In cancer cells, CpG islands of tumour suppressors are hypermethylated and consequently silenced. Tumour suppressors block cell division in the absence of growth factors or lead to apoptosis in the presence of DNA damage, and their loss leads to uncontrolled tissue growth. Loss of tumour suppressors offers a proliferative and evolutionary advantage to cancer cells carrying such (epi-)mutations. This is a stable contributor to cancer progression as DNA methylation is maintained during cell divisions just as mutations.<br /><br />Methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements mark them and prevent the formation of transposons mutagenically inserting them in other sections of the genome, leading to genome instability due to illegitimate recombinations. Furthermore, unmethylated  intergenic regions and repetitive elements can interfere with normal transcription promoter region activity or lead to the transcription of stretches of DNA  which are not transcribed in normal conditions . <br />In cancer cells, the genome in general is hypomethylated, and there is genomic instability also due to the loss of apoptotic safeguards. Both hypomethylation and genome instability are strong hallmarks of cancer seen in a wide spectrum of tissues. Genome instability leads increased diversity within the tumour, and to evolutionary optimization of growth/metastasis potential as well as treatment resistance. As such, genome instability caused by hypomethylation amplifies the potency of the tumour.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 is an oncogene with proliferative activity. Its normal dosage is therefore regulated to prevent neoplasms. In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprinted control region is methylated in the paternal allele and blocks the recruitment of an insulator protein, CTCF which insulates Igf2 from its enhancer. Thus, in the paternal allele Igf2 is enhanced for transcription. Furthermore, the neighboring H19 gene is methylated by methylation spreading from the control region and is transcriptionally silenced. In the maternal allele, the imprinted control region is unmethlyated and binds to the insulator protein CTCF. Consequently, the enhancer region cannot promote the Igf2 transcription and methylation cannot spread to the H19 region. Thus, Igf2 is silenced whereas H19 is expressed. In the case of the Wilm's tumour, both alleles of the H19/Igf2 cluster are hypermethylated leading to a double dose of Igf2 expression by the mechanism explained above leading to increased growth potential.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating small molecule which is a cytidine analog. It incorporates into the DNA in place of Cytosine and prevents DNA Methyltransferase activity, effectively leading to DNA hypomethlyation. In cancer types where the hypermethylation of a particular tumour suppressor is a major driver, this can re-enable growth suppression and apoptotic potential. Though the hypomethylation hallmark of cancer is not mitigated by the mechanism of this drug, the re-activation of tumour suppressor genes can be sufficient in treating the tumour. However, if the cancer type is not driven by CpG island methylation of tumour suppressors, such a therapy would be counter-productive due to further increased DNA hypomethylation and resulting genomic instability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the presence of normal DNA methyltransferase activity, DNA methylation profiles are mitotically maintained in successive cell divisions. Thus, a hypermethylated region which is demethylated by therapy, will maintain its resulting hypomethylation in its future generations. <br />Epigenetic control is sensitive to environmental factors in early embryonic development and during the development/differentiation of germ cells such as the ovum and sperms.<br />While cancer patients are long past the stage of early embryonic epigenetic sensitivity to environmental factors, as adults they still produce germ cells and can reproduce. Any drugs that alter the genome-wide methylation characteristics of a patient at a time where the patient intends to have a child, can have unpredictable and possibly lethal consequences for fetal development. Consequently, it is inadvisable to treat patients intending to have a baby during the period of epigenetic treatment. </div>
