    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">-normally CpG islands are present in 60% of promoters of genes and they are kept usually unmethylated. as this unmethylation status allows gene expression.<br />-in cancer cells CpG islands are hypermethylated leading to suppression of gene activation.<br />-DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to suppression of tumor suppressor genes which leads to cancer by promoting cellular growth.<br />-normally intergenic and repetitive elements are methyalated to maintain genomic stability<br />-in cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated<br />-this hypomethylation causes genomic instability resulting in illegitimate recombinations between repeats , activation of repeats and transposition, also activation of cryptic promoter and disruption to neighboring genes as in agouty and axin allele,.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">-parental allele is methylated in the imprint control region (ICR) preventing CTCF from binding to it . (CTCF is an insulator protein , insulating Igf2 from downstream enhancers thus preventing its expression.) without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence it and enhancers then can access Igf2 to activate its expression.therefore , Igf2 is paternally expressed.<br />- maternal allele is not methylated at the ICR  thus CTCF binds to it, insulating Igf2 from down stream enhancers, also no methylation occurs to the promoter of H19 and thus enhancers acts on H19 only ...leading to suppression of Igf2 expression. therefore, Igf2 is maternally imprinted.<br />- in wilm's tumor:both maternal and paternal ICRs are methylated thus Igf2 is expressed from both alleles.<br />-in cancer: both maternal and paternal ICRs are methylated thus Igf2 is expressed from both alleles rather than paternal monoallelic expression in normal individuals , leading to overexpression of Igf2 and wilm's tumor occurs. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">- it is DNA demethylating agent (DNMT inhibitor). nucleoside analogue.<br />-it causes DNA demethylation<br />-at low doses, it irreversibly binds to DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA(as they are nucleoside analogue), thus they are replication dependent .<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">-altering DNA methylation can have serious side effects as it affect epigenetic control ( if given systematically) of all other tissues. especially in sensitive periods.As they don't kill cells they rather change its epigenetic marks arresting its growth, these effects may extend to other non neoplastic cells and may last beyond treatment .<br />-sensitive periods are those periods important for laying down the epigenetic marks and removing them, where any change in the environment would have huge impact on the DNA epigenetics.<br />- these are the periods of epigenetic reprogramming: primordial germ cell formation and post-implantation (early embryonic development).<br />- in young age , germ cells are not mature and it is a sensitive period where epigenetic reprogramming occurs; removing and reseting of epigenetic marks and imprinting resetting occurs. any disruption in this process can lead to severe outcomes and syndrome in next generation.</div>
