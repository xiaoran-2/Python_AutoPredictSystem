    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, the usual function of DNA methylation, is to silence (via methyl marks), the repetitive elements. (Many of them are transposons that must be silenced, if not, they can jump in the middle of a gene and disrupt its function), and the intergenic regions.<br /><br />On the contrary, CpG islands are unmethylated because they lay down before the functional genes, and they need to be free and active, so that their genes can produce the proteins.<br /><br />In cancer we can observe a  genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, mainly in the repetitive regions, CpG poor promoters (allowing proto-oncogenes to be transformed in oncogenes), and in ICRs, allowing loss of imprinting. Interestingly, there's hypermethylation in the CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. Because all of these changes, repetitive regions like transposons, are able to replicate themselves and disrupt the genome, disabling normal genes. The unmethylation of proto-oncogenes, transform them in oncogenes, giving the cancerous cells the power to grow and divide forever. This is aggravated by the methylation of the tumor suppressor genes, which are unable to produce the proteins that could stop this crazy growing and dividing.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting disorders can contribute to several syndromes and cancer tumors. In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the maternal allele has a free, unmethylated ICR, which binds CTCF. This allows H19 gene to be activated, and its action consists in stoping  some enhancers from activating Igf2 (a growth factor gene).<br /><br />In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, so H19 can not be produced, so, there's no problem to the enhancers to go and activate the growth factor Igf2.<br /><br />All we have normally one paternal allele and one maternal allele, but when disruption comes over these alleles, one maternal allele is lost, and gain of one or more paternal allele is gained, and as a consequence there's overproduction of Igf2, which promotes uncontrolled growing, predisposing also to embryonic tumors like Willms tumor of the kidney. This is called Beckwith Widemann Syndrome.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. It's an hypomethylation agent. It works switching off the DNA methyltransferase. In cancer cells DNA methyltransferase is responsible for silencing tumor suppressor genes via methyl marks. During cell division, Decitabine irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferase, after they are incorporated to DNA, so that the inherited pattern of methylation and silencing in tumor suppressor genes is stopped, and the tumor suppressor proteins can be generated and able to destroy the cancer cells.  Decitabine acts in dividing cells. and as far as the cancer cells are really fast dividing, they are the most affected by this drug, whereas the normal cells are less affected.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, the methylation pattern is copied from a cell to its daughters cells via DNA methyltransferase, but in cancer cells, the abnormal methylations pattern allows transposons and intergenic regions to be expressed, and also the proto-oncogenes are over-exppressed, whereas the tumor suppressor genes are silenced, and this abnormal pattern is also inherited via DNA methyltransferase.<br /><br />As far as the methylation marks are inherited, when an epigenetic drug is administered, all the daughter cells will have the new epigenetic marks, even when the treatment has been stopped, and the oncogenes will not longer be overexppressed, and also the tumor suppressor genes will be free and able to produce proteins that fight with cancer cells even after the treatment.<br /><br />There are periods when it would be unadvisable to use epigenetic drugs. These sensitive periods are the preimplantation embryonic period, the primordial germ cell formation, (that is to say, during gestation), and the maturation of germ cells (during adolescence). During these sensitive periods the epigenetic marks are erased and resetted, so, disrupting this process with a drug would end up in a disaster for the embryo's epigenome in a pregnant woman or in the future children of an adolescent.</div>
