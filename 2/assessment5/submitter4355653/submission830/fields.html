    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. CpG islands are normally free of methylation.<br />2. They are hypermethylated.<br />3. Methylation silences the promotors of the tumour suppressing genes, they become repressed and this facilitates tumour development.<br />4. Normally they are methylated.<br />5. They lose methylation.<br />6. <span>Hypomethylation can stimulate initiation of transcription, use of alternative promoter, co-transcriptional splicing, and production of intragenic noncoding RNA transcripts.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. In the paternal allele several cites near H19 are methylated, lgf2 is expressed.<br />2. In the maternal allele those cites are not methylated, and lgf2 is suppressed.<br />3. Maternal allele acquires the paternal type of methylation (gets methylated) - lgf2 is expressed, H19 is suppressed.<br />4. Lost Igf2 imprinting causes abnormal hypermethylation of H19, which leads to its reduced expression and enhanced cell growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. It belongs to the DNA-demethylators, able to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.<br />2. It decreases the level of methylation.<br />3. It incorporates into DNA strands and inhibits DNA methyltransferase</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. Acquired epigenetic changes are being passed to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are erased. After that they do not return; the cells remain alive.<br />2. It is a period when the organism is especially susceptible to the environmentally induced epigenetic changes.<br />3. Sensitive periods when a patient can physically be treated (sensitive periods of embryo development do not count here) include early infancy, childhood, and adolescence.<br />4. It leads to the disruption of the normal epigenetic development, which can lead to further defects of methylation patterns and can cause diseases in the future (because epigenetic changes are being passed to the daughter cells during the cell division).</div>
