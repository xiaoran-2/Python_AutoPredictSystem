    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation of CpG islands is normally a silencing mechanism. In cancer CpG islands undergo hypermethylation, becoming methylated where they normally would not be. If, for example, a transcription factor is used to repress a gene that is active in cancer (oncogene), then methylation of the relevant CpG island will silence this repression and allow expression of the oncogene.  CpG island hypermethylation may also contribute to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br />Methylation at intergenic regions and repetive elements prevents gene activation and aids in forming heterochromatin, which in turns prevents DNA recombination, particularly of repetitive elements. i.e. methylation assists in genetic stability. In cancer, these intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated, leading to heterochromatin becoming more open in structure, like euchromatin, and more susceptible to recombination, leading to genetic instability. This instability in the form of gene deletions, recombination and insertions disturbs the normal functioning of genes, such as deleting essential functions or turning on genes that would otherwise be repressed. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, an imprinting control repeat (ICR) is located downstream of insulin-like growth factor 2 (<i>igf2</i>) and upstream of the H19 coding region. Two enhancer sequences are encoded just upstream of H19 and which can bind to the <i>igf2</i> promoter and to the H19 promoter. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, while on the maternal allele it is unmethylated. The unmethylated state, allows binding of the CTCF insulator protein and prevents access of the enhancer proteins to the <i>igf2</i> promoter. As a result, the enhancer proteins increase the transcription of H19, a long non-coding RNA while Igf2 expression is turned off.<br /><br />On the paternal allele, CTFC cannot bind to the methylated ICR and the enhancer proteins preferentially bind to the <i>igf2 </i>promtoter, causing increased expression. Methylation of the ICR spreads along the DNA to H19, further decreasing its chances of transcription.<br /><br />Greater than normal expression of Igf2, as in Beckwith-Weiderman syndrome, can lead to cancer. In Wilms tumor (kidney tumor), methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele does not occur, leading to loss of imprinting and Igf2 is expressed from both alleles causing cellular overgrowth and tumor formation. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylase. Hypermethylation of CpG islands is a hallmark of cancer and increases the longer the disease is present. Hypermethylation can for example cause the silencing of tumor suppressors or the activation of oncogenes through silencing of their repressors. Decitabine is a cytidine analog and is incorporated in to the DNA of dividing cells. It irreversibly binds to DNA methyl transferases, preventing methylation. Since DNA replication must occur during cell division, Decitabine will be preferentially incorporated in rapidly dividing tumor cells and at the correct dosage, presumably returns methylation levels to near normal. This in turn will reduce the tumor promoting effects of hypermethylation and incorrect methylation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, such that within different cell lines the same pattern of methylation is maintained. Incorrect patterns of DNA methylation, altered through aberrant DNA methyl transferase action, is therefore also mitotically heritable and has a lasting effect on whichever tissue is involved. <br /><br />A sensitive period is the time span where epigenetic marks are wiped out and reset. These sensitive periods occur during primordial germ cell development in the fetus and during the pre-implantation period (i.e. 1 cell stage to blastocyst). <br /><br />Treatment with epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods would prevent the fundamental epigenetic patterns from being established. For example drugs inhibiting DNA methyltransferases could disrupt the de-novo transfer of methyl groups that establishes gene expression patterns that are then maintained by maintenance methyltransferases. Methyltransferase inhibitors, given at the pre-implantation stage could lead to improper tissue development in the fetus and drugs given during the primordial germ cell development could lead to infertility through incorrect methylation patterns in the egg or sperm. <br /></div>
