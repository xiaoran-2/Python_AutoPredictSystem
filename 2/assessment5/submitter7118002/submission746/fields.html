    <h1>Submission 746 from Anon (session_user_id: 24a793488c14f1d68ff21c09a044ac06e7eeeb36)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Decitabine</strong> sold under the commercial name of Dacogen by a japanese company  Eisai, belongs to the class of <strong>DNA- Demethylating agent or hypomethylating agent</strong>, and primarily functions by <strong>inhibting the action of DNA methyltransferases enzyme</strong> responsible for methyl group transfer to DNA  strands. This DNMT inhibitor is an <strong>analogue of cytidine-pyrimidine </strong>and <strong>gets incorporated into DNA  </strong>and <strong>binds with the DNMT</strong> leading to the depletion of the enzyme which results in inhibtion of hyper methylation which will stimulate the activity of the tumor supression gene, thereby controlling growth. By the formation of this covalent adduct, they attack certain components in the rapidly dividing cells thereby killing them(acts as antimetabolite) without affecting the normal cells and at very low doses and is capable of <strong>modulating 4-20 genes</strong> responsible for cancer.They're primarily treated  for <strong>MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome)</strong> precursor to myelomic leukima.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the normal cell, the<strong> CpG islands </strong>present in the promoters of the tumour suppressor genes are <strong>hypo-methylated</strong> which renders it active in controlling growth and hence tumour. whereas In the <strong>cancer cells , the CpG islands are hyper-methylated </strong>and the percentage of these <strong>increase with increase in the age</strong>, which shows the <strong>increasing risk of cancer at older ages</strong> as these are usually present in promoters of genes especially tumour suppressor genes. The level of the hyper-methylation of the CpG island increases with the  progression of the cancer. This <strong>DNA hyper-methylation can lead to</strong> the activation of not only the silencing of the tumour suppressor genes but also the <strong>inactivation of  various cellular pathways like the DNA repair, cell cycle and apoptosis, cell adherence and detoxification etc. </strong>all of which play an important role in the maintenance of the normal state of the cell.<br /><br />In the normal cells , the intergenic regions and the repititive elements are highly methylated which <strong>may interfere with the transcription and translation process  or may not allow the expression cryptic promoters</strong> which may lead to the production of the RNA's or certain protein that stimulate tumours. whereas in the <strong>cancer cells</strong>, it is the vice versa wherein in there is hypo-methylation of the elements, which may <strong>activate the cryptic promoters which may lead to abberations or they may be insertions or deletions due to genomic instability </strong>as adequate methylation is necessary to prevent degradation the chromosome.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 cluster a set of alleles that are always expressed reciprocally and <strong>they share enhancers present downstream</strong>. Ins normal case, in the<strong> paternal allele the H19 gene and the Imprint control gene  ( ICR )</strong>  upstream to the H19 gene are <strong>hypermethylated </strong>which <strong>silences the H19 gene </strong>and allows the<strong> Igf2 gene to be stimulated by the enhancers</strong> thereby allowing expression of growth, while on the <strong>maternal allele</strong> a insulating protein called <strong>CTCF binds to the ICR</strong> and  prevents the expression of the<strong> Igf2 gene</strong> so that<strong> H19 gene is expressed </strong>and its expression is enhanced by the enhancers.<br /><br />In the case of will's tumor , there is <strong>hypermethylation on the ICR</strong> and the <strong>downstream H19 gene</strong> which results in the enhancers inducing and enhancing the expression of the Igf2 gene ie there is <strong>biallelic expression</strong> which results in uncontrolled growth ultimately leading to tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a <strong>mitotically heritable process</strong>, which means that the silencing or activation  of the genes caused by the DNA methylation  is <strong>transferred from one  generation to another</strong> which explains the genetic basis of the tumour as most of the <strong>silencing occurs in the case of the tumour suppressor genes and the activation occurs with respect to the proto-oncogenes. </strong>However for every epigenetic mechanism they are completely wiped out during the sensitive period for laying of new epigenitic marks consistent with the conversion of the the<strong> highly specialised cells to primitive embryonic stages including the removal of X-inactivation</strong> and other processes.The sensitive period is usually during the two stages namely, during <strong>gametogenisis</strong>, where the marks are removed for laying of specialised epigenetic marks for specialised functions in sperm and ovum respectively, and the second is <strong>after the fertilization process, during the production of the embryonic cells for inducing the totipotency.</strong><br /><br />However treatment of these epigenetic drugs during the sensitive period is inadvisable as this is the period during which the old marks are wiped out in which case <strong>the drugs which have been targeted for those marks would become ineffective or they may cause changes in new epigenetic  marks.</strong></div>
