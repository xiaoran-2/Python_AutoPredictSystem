    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA
methylation at CpG islands is a mark that encodes for X inactivation,
imprinting. There are two kinds of CpG methylated islands, the ones described
above but another kind of CpG Island that is found in promoters is unmethylated
so that genes can be expressed. When methylation of CpG islands occurs in
cancer particularly in the promoter there is a disruptive regulation of gene
expression which leads to malignancy. Due to DNA methylation at CpG in
promoters contributes to gene expression when this is the other way these genes
are repressed and unable to control cell homeostasis. </p><p>

</p><p><span>The normal function of DNA methylation of intergenic regions is to prevent
genome instability, by avoiding illegitimate recombination between repeats and
events of transposition.  There are
several transposons in the intergenic regions and its suppression depends on
its methylation. In cancer there is a disruption of DNA regulation, and it is
commonly described as a hypomethylated state of the genome. When this occurs
the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated so that they
are not fully suppressed. This has a consequence in the genome instability, for
instance, Illegitimate recombination can occur also transposition and more
dangerous a translocation of a part of a chromosome to another. This has a
great impact in cancer because they accumulate mutations and also promotes the
expression of certain growth factors that maintain malignancy. </span></p><p><span>It can happen that due to a chromosomal translocation; some genes are
not being suppressed speaking of an oncogene for instance. Therefore this promotes
tumour growth. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The cluster H19/Igf2 contains the Igf2 gene folloed by an imprinted
center region and the H19 gene with enhancers. In the paternal allele the ICR
is methylated so that CTCF protein cannot bind besides H19 promoter is methylated,
and the enhancers can act on Igf2 so that it is expressed and H19 does not. In the
maternal allele neither the ICR nor H19 gene are methylated so that CTCF can
bind to the ICR and this blocks enhancers activation of Igf2 therefore inhibiting
its expression but in turn activating H19 expression.</p>

<p><span>While in normal cells the methylation of ICR is differential, in WIlm´s
Tumour, both ICRs are hypermethylated so that both H19 genes are suppressed and
both Igf2 genes are activated and constantly transcribed. Because ICR and H19
are methylated CTCF cannot bind to the ICR and prevent Igf2 expression. There
are several clusters that regulate growth, if this disrupting event occurs in a
cell it can modify the expression of growth restricting genes, and on the other
hand cause an overexpression of growth promoting genes. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span> The </span><span>5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine is a drug that inhibits DNA methyltranferases, because
of that it can be used against cancer, at low doses it has been reported that
it can induce hypomethylation of DNA this results in the re activation of
several genes that were suppressed by methylation such as tumour suppressor
genes. Because of its function and structure it has been proposed that the
Decitabine’s mechanism of action Is via its incorporation into DNA when
replications occurs, since Decitabine is similar in structure to cytosine
methyl-transferases can bind to it and form a covalent binding that in turns
prevent further synthesis and cell division. Because Decitabine can integrates
to DNA in replication and blocking further synthesis and cell division it has
an effect as a cytotoxicity agent that kills cells with high rate division. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The epigenome is a balance between methylated genes and unmethylated
genes along with several other epigenetics marks. Because this epigenetics
marks are mitotically heritable they can have a great impact on gene expression
in daughter cells. Altering the methylation of DNA in cancer cells can somehow
make them more susceptible to other chemotherapy treatments, that is because some
genes that were suppressed now are activated and contribute to the loss of
malignancy phenotype. Sensitive periods are states were DNA is very susceptible
to external signals that they have a great impact on DNA epigenome status. During
development there are two sensitive periods the firs it previous to implantation
where the entire DNA is unmethylated and there is no X chromosome inactivation
yet. The other period is in gonadal development. Treating patients during these
periods would bring problems because there would be a disruptive methylation of
DNA that would result in loss of imprinting genes and X chromosome inactivation.several syndromes are related with a disruption in DNA methylation so that it is important to avoid treatments with epigenetic drugs in sensitive periods.  </span></p></div>
