    <div class="field-value"><div>In cancer normal methylation levels tend to decrease as the cancer progresses; however CpG islands are hypermethylated. These differences in methylation are known as "marks cancer" and are used to know which stage cancer patient lies. <br /><br /></div><div>In a normal situation the CpG islands are hypomethylated, that is usually not methylated; while repetitive elements, intragenic regions and introns are hypermethylated. En cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated and intergenic regions, repetitive elements and introns appearing the hypomethylated. Therefore, one can say that there is a reciprocal exchange regarding DNA methylation<br /><br /><div>DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands is an epigenetic mutation consisting promoters silencing of tumor suppressor genes. This DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation and it is much more common. CpG island hypermethylation is different depending on the tumor, that is, different regions are methylated, no cancer has the same methylated CpG islands.<br /><br /></div><div>DNA methylation is a reversible process, which allows the therapeutic action with good results for patients. Currently considered one of the hits of the Knudson hypothesis, that is, cancer does not appear for a single event, but it should give a series of events begins to tumorigenesis, including inactivation of tumor suppressor genes , activation of oncogenes...<br />The use of biomarkers for detecting the DNA hypermethylation is clinically favored, as it is very sensitive<br /><br /><div>DNA hypomethylation leads to genomic instability in which deletions, insertions and translocations which ends in an illegitimate recombination occurs. Repeated elements are able to make copies of themselves and "jump" to other regions of the genome, which can activate neighboring genes are oncogenes. </div><div>Hypomethylation of repeated elements produces different effects depending on where it occurs. Hypomethylation was the first epigenetic abnormality was discovered. Occurs early and progresses as the cancer progresses and is different in different types of cancer.</div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In cancer cells is a loss of imprinting both hypermethylation and hypomethylation by, or is not expressed a single allele, paternal or maternal, or both but not expressed or is expressed none.</div><div><br /></div><div>An example of this is the loss H19/Igf2 cluster printing, when it is a normal cell, the maternal allele the CTCF, wherein the isolation member is attached, which allows the joining and H19 enhancer is not methylated while expressing that Igf2 is silenced; while the paternal allele is methylated CTCF and H19, therefore, the enhancer is the Igf2 allowing its expression.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>In the case of tumor cells both in the maternal allele in paternal H19 and CTCF are methylated and therefore bind to the Igf2 enhancers, which is a double dose of Igf2, thereby, increasing the expression of gene promoters growth.</div><div><br /></div><div>Loss of imprinting cluster Igf2/H19 is property of Wilm's tumor. This tumor is a neoplasm of the kidney and the second most common type of abdominal cancer in children. Although the loss of imprinting occurs in a large number of different tumor types.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is a very early event and usually appears in preneoplastic tissues, that is, loss of imprinting appears even before the tumor develops</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine is sold as Dacogen by Eisai a company Japanese. It is a member of a new class of drugs known as "demethylating" agents of DNA. An increase in DNA methylation can cause blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes", so that cell division is no longer regulated and allows or promotes cancer.</div><div><br /></div><div>Decitabine is believed that has dual anticancer effect. One approach is by demethylation process by which the normal tumor suppressor genes function, so that the control of cell growth is restored is restored.</div><div><br /></div><div>Moreover, Decitabine belongs to the category of chemotherapy drugs called antimetabolites. Antimetabolic are very similar to normal substances in the cell. When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of target cells within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes the death of cancer cells that divide rapidly</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The metilacón DNA is an epigenetic process and epigenetic changes, unlike other forms of gene regulation like transcription factors, are transmitted from generation to generation, that is, at each cell division are transmitted from the mother cell to cell daughter, until these changes are actively erased, and they no longer appear. Therefore, epigenetic changes could be made terapas would stop the growth of cancer without killing all cells.</div><div>Epigenetic changes in the so-called sensitive periods are stages of development in which the active remodeling occurs, by which epigenetic marks are eliminated and others are set in different locations of the genome. There are two main periods are the development of germ cells to mature production of gametes and the preimplantation period and the post-implantation period termprana.</div><div>Knowing this about sensitive periods would not be advisable to treat patients, and that epigenetic changes that produce the drugs will be deleted and others were created.</div></div>
