    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer originates from the activation of oncogenes or inactivation of
tumour suppressors, which can be caused by genetic or epigenetic abnormalities.
Epigenetic abnormalities are mainly by demethylation (i.e. hypomethylation) of
intergenic regions and repetitive elements, or hypermethylation of CpG islands.</p>

<p><span><span>CpG
islands are normally protected
from methylation, and function as promoters of genes (where transcription
starts).</span> When methylation DOES
occur at CpG island, it causes silencing of the gene. CpG islands are
often involved with growth or tumour suppressing, so if these regions because
methylated (and thus silenced) it could leads to overgrowth of cells: cancer. </span></p>

<p><span>Intergenic regions and
repetitive elements, on the other hand, are normally methylated genome-wide. Their
function is to secure the integrity of the gene, in order to avoid deletions,
translocations, insertions and duplications. Repetitive elements are genes that
cut-and-paste or copy-and-paste somewhere in the genome. Methylation helps to
silence these repetitive elements or prevent transposition and prevent
illegitimate recombination. If these regions are demethylated, the rate of
avoid deletions, translocations, insertions and duplication will increase,
which increases enhances tumorigenesis. </span></p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/lgf2 is a cluster of growth
restriction genes, which is controlled by enhancer blocking. The CTCF insulator
protein is unmethylated on the maternal allele, which means H19 is free to
enhance expression and Igf2 is silenced. On the paternal allele, DNA
methylation at the imprinted control region blocks binding of CTCF, which means
DNA methylation spreads (and silences) H19, due to which enhancers can access
(and activate) lgf2.</p>

<p><span>Hypermethylation at imprinted control
regions will lead to loss of expression. 
So alterations in DNA methylation at the H19/lgf2 imprinted control gene
cluster (hyper-or hypo methylation) can result in loss of expression of growth
restriction genes, or over-expression of growth promoting genes. </span></p>

<p>It can lead to cancer when
methylation occurs at CTCF on the maternal allele (as is normally only the case
for the paternal allele), which leads to silencing of H19 and the activation of
lgf2 by enhancers upstream. Growth will be enhanced, which leads to Wilm’s
tumour. </p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dnmt1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) is a
hypomethylator, which recognises hemi-methylated DNA and restores methylation
on both strands. By this means it maintains methyltransferase of genes after
cell division. Deletion of this Dnmt1 inhibitor in specific tissues will
increase genomic instability, which leads to cancer. </p>

<p><span>Decitabine
is a Dnmt1 inhibitor, which hypomethylates genes by incorporating in the DNA
strand during replication and transcription, inhibiting Dnmt1. It is a chemical
analogue of cytidine, which inhibits methyltransferase, causing demethylation
in that sequence. It c<span>an
be used to recover CpG island hypermethylation, thereby killing cancer cell growth.
Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), including anemia
and leukemia.  </span></span></p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Cancer
can be treated with epigenetic drugs. The idea is that small molecules attach
to epigenetic markers and inhibit their function, reversing epigenetic
alterations that caused cancer in the first place. The drugs can best target
enzymatic epigenetic regulators, since they are reached the easiest. Epigenetic alterations are mitotically heritable,
meaning they are passed on during cell division to daughter and
granddaughter cells, it leads to lifelong
change in behavior. Once erased, they do not return.</span></p>

<p>One
risk is the lack of specificity, which could mean it have long term effect on
normal cells. Older patients seem to respond very well, but younger patients
must be careful because they might still have children and their gametes could
have been affected by epigenetic treatment. During embryogenesis/gametogenesis and
early development, epigenetic marks are established (i.e. resetting of DNA methylation,
histone marks, and x inactivation), which is called the sensitive period.
Logically, epigenetic treatment during the sensitive period might change
natural epigenetic control, which is inadvisable. </p><span>
