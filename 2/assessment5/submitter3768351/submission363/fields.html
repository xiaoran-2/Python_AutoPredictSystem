    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p><ul><li>CpG islands are often
located at promoter of genes. So the normal function of DNA methylation
at CpG islands is silencing of gene expression, which is realized by either formation
of a repressive chromatin structure or by prohibiting transcription factor
binding.  Usually in normal cells the CpG
islands are not methylated.</li><li>In contrast with normal cells, the CpG islands in cancer
are usually hyper-methylated. In some cancer such as colorectal cancer or gliomas, we can find CpG islands of a set of genes hyper-methylated.<br /></li><li>In cancer, DNA methylation serves as an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumor suppressor genes. According to genome-wide
DNA methylation studies, the identity
of hyper-methylated CGIs varies
by tumor type. And CGI methylation also progresses with time.<br /></li><li>The normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to
maintain genomic integrity. 
Specifically, DNA methylation in intergenic regions can silence cryptic
transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites.  DNA methylation in repetitive regions can (1)
silence repeats to prevent transposition (2) mutate repeats (meC to T) to
prevent transposition (3) silence repeat to avoid transcriptional interference
from strong promoters (4) methylate repeats to prevent illegitimate
recombination<br /></li><li>In cancer, the
intergenic region and repetitive elements are usually hypo-methylated.<br /></li><li>The
hypo-methylation in intergenic region and repetitive elements contributes to cancer by causing genomic instability in following ways: (1) Illegitimate recombination
between repeats (2) Activation of repeats and transposition (3) Activation of
cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes<br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In paternal allele, the ICR is methylated which blocks binding of CTCF. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter and silence its transcription, so that enhancers downstream can access lgf2 to active its expression.</li><li>In maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated. So lgf2 is insulated from downstream enhancers by CTCF protein and thus lgf2 is not expressed. The enhancers instead helps with the expression of H19.</li><li>In Wilm's tumor, the ICR on maternal allele is also methylated and thus lgf2 on this allele is also expressed.</li><li>Since both alleles are methylated, lgf2 is over-expressed in Wilm's tumor. Because lgf2 is an oncogene that promotes growth, this eventually contributes to cancer. </li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents, or DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.</li><li>Decitabine is a kind of nucleotide analogues which can irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA so that DNMTs are gradually depleted as replication goes on. In this way Decitabine leads to the decrease of DNA methylation.</li><li>As in many tumor and cancers, there are hyper-methylation in CpG islands which shut down tumor suppressor genes. So the use of Decitabine can reduce the level of hyper-methylation in these regions and reactive the tumor suppressor genes which leads to an anti-tumor effect.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable due to the role of DNA methyltransferases. Thus the alteration in DNA methylation will be maintained and have enduring effects on the epigenome.</li><li>Sensitive period means a period when changes in the environment (including drugs and diets) has the biggest effect on the epigenome.</li><li>There are two sensitive period (1) (primordial) germ cell development period (2) early development period </li><li>Treating patients during sensitive periods may lead to the consequence that the epigenetic changes brought by the drugs are maintained and has a long-lasting effect on the patients' epigenome, which could be harmful.</li></ul></div>
