    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands
reside in the promoter regions of particular genes and play a protective role by
remaining unmethylated, which allows expression of those genes.   In
cancers, however, disruption of the normal state in a cell allows hypermethylation
of the CpG islands in promoters of genes known as tumor suppressor genes in
that cell.  In a cancer state, genes involved
with tumor-associated processes such as cell division (mitosis), cell
differentiation and extracellular matrix remodeling (organ homeostasis), or
apoptosis (cell death) are repressed by methylation of the CpG islands in the
promoters.  After an insult to a cell
that would normally trigger death, in cancer the cell continues to live and
grow beyond normal limits.</p>

<p>Methylation
of the CpG islands prevents transcription of the gene by setting up a physical
barrier to the transcriptional assembly proteins needed to bind to the promoter
region.  Methylation also recruits
additional proteins which modify histone and chromatin causing formation of the
compacted heterochromatin to further prevent the gene from coming in contact
with transcriptional proteins.</p>

<p>Normally, intergenic
regions and repetitive elements are maintained in a methylated state within
cells. Intergenic regions
have the capacity to be transcribed in both directions as well as from either
strand, resulting in confounding
signals.  In a cancerous state, demethylation
of these regions results in uncontrolled DNA transcription.  Repetitive sequences make up a large proportion
of the mammalian genome.  They are
involved in many aspects of the chromosome. 
They are in centromeres and telomeres. 
They are the long terminal repeats that are used by viruses to insinuate
into the genome. And they are the transposable elements that can change position
within the genome.   Maintaining methylation of these regions keeps
them inactive.  Demethylation results in
global changes, increased mutation rates, and chromosome instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>A well-documented example of imprinting is
the H19/IGF2 cluster.  IGF2 is a growth
factor and is expressed from the paternal allele. H19 is transcribed from the
maternal allele.</span> <span> Both genes share common regulators of
expression, such as enhancers and insulator protein CTCF-binding sites.  CTCF determines which gene (H19 or IGF2) the
enhancer influences, and that decision is based on methylation of the imprint
control region (ICR). The ICR contains the CTCF-binding regions. </span></p>

<p><span> In
the paternal allele the ICR is methylated which prevents H19 from being
expressed.  The enhancers can work on
paternal IGF2 to allow transcription.  In
the maternal allele, however, the ICR is unmethylated so the CTCF insulator protein
can bind which prevents the enhancers from working on maternal IGF2. Maternal
H19 will be expressed.  </span></p>

<p><span>Wilm’s tumor occurs when the maternal
allele has the ICR methylation pattern of a paternal allele so that IGF2 is
expressed from both alleles.  This causes
increased cell growth. </span></p>

<p><span>Several other cancers are the result of dysregulation
of IGF2. Hypermethylation results in overexpression of IGF2. H19 may act as a
tumor suppressor such that, with inactivation of H19, IGF2 will over-express.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor used to treat
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).  These are
bone marrow disorders and patients are not able to make sufficient blood cells.
 Many genes are hypermethylated in MDS,
for example the tumor suppressor p15<i>INK4B</i><i>.</i><i> 
</i>Epigenetic
silencing of p15<i>INK4B
</i>is<i>
</i>common<i>
</i>in many blood disorders.</p>

<p>Decitabine works as a cytosine analogue, to incorporate into
DNA with cell division.  Demethylation of DNA and cell
differentiation allows normal expression of the tumor suppressor genes.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>We know that epigenetic changes are passed on to subsequent
generations.  Effects on an individual
(environmental toxins, disease, developmental insults) will alter DNA
methylation.  These alterations will be
present in the organism throughout its life, and the effects can be felt in
subsequent generations. </p>

<p>During early embryonic development and gamete development
are particularly sensitive periods for epigenetic changes because these are
times when stripping and relaying of epigenetic marks occur. Drugs, treatments,
or manipulations at these times can possibly, detrimentally, alter the natural
processes of clearing and re-applying the marks will then have lasting effects
on the organism.</p></div>
