    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation at CpG islands is
involved in regulating gene expression in X-chromosome inactivation, imprinting
and  cell-type-specific expression. Most CpG
islands are found in the promoter region of genes, and when unmethylated the
genes are expressed. In cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands can induce silencing
of tumor suppressor and DNA repair genes. </span>

</p><p><span>In normal cells, intergenic regions
and repetitive elements are hypermethylated and heterochromatized. When intergenic
regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated, they can misalign resulting
in illegitimate recombination and transposition. This contributes to genomic
instability, which is associated with cancer.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The imprint control region (ICR) is methylated
on the paternal allele leading to the expression of Igf2. While on the maternal
allele the ICR is un-methylated, and the insulator CTCF bind to the ICR, inhibiting
the expression of Igf2. In Wilm’s tumour the ICR is hypermethylated, so Igf2 is
expressed from both the paternal and maternal allele, giving a “double dose” of
Igf2. Since Igf2 is a growth factor, a “double dose” will enhance
tumorigenesis.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating
drug, which inhibit DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). Decitabine is a cytidine
analog, which are incorporated into the DNA during replication, afterwards DNMT
is irreversibly bound to the DNA. Tumour cells will be more affected, because they
divide more rapidly. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by reducing the hypermethylation
on tumours, which have hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumour suppressor
genes.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenomic modifications, like DNA
methylation, remain as cells divide and in some cases can be inherited through
the generations. This means that drugs that alter DNA methylation should not be
given to children<span><i>, </i>who are<i> </i></span>growing<span><i> </i>and<i>
</i></span>developing.
Likewise, the drugs should not be given adults planning pregnancy,
as the epigenetic reprogramming during early embryonic development and
primordial germ cell development are sensitive periods, in which DNA is de-methylated
and re-methylated.</span></p>
