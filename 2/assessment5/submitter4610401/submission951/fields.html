    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is one of several and the most understood mechanism for regulating gene expression. Regulation of gene expression is critically important for human health (and any organism's health) as not all genes should be active all the time and many other DNA elements such as repetitive elements for instance should remain silenced. DNA methylation occurs with greatest density at cytosine-guanine rich regions also called CpG islands. They are interspersed in the genome and when methylated result in hypo expression of neighboring genes. Epigenetically-controlled suppression of gene function is often used to silence oncogenes - genes that promote tumorigenesis. These oncogenes could act through one of several ways - as potent signals for proliferation and uncontrolled cell division, suppressors of signals that when activated lead to programmed cell death,  stimulators of angiogenesis, suppressors of DNA repair machinery, promoters of normal tissue invasion and/or blood vessel invasion. When DNA methylation is disrupted near oncogenes malignant cell transformation often occurs and cancer develops. <br /><br />On the other hand the non-CpG regions in tumor tissue tend to be hypomethylated. These regions are rich in repetitive elements which when hypomethylated and exposed are more prone to reciprocal translocations, insertions and deletions which can disrupt DNA structure and cause genetic defects leading to the rise of cancerous tissue or to increased malignancy of the existing tumor. These regions are also where CpG poor promoters are found. Hypomethylation of these promoter regions tends to activate all associated genes (which are normally silenced). If the genes that are disrupted by repetitive elements or DNA recombination are tumor suppression genes or the genes activated by CpG poor promoters are oncogenes tumorigenesis is initiated.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 (H19/insulin-like growth factor 2) cluster is one example of parental imprinting in humans. In normal tissue on the maternally derived DNA strand the imprint control region (ICR) is hypomethylated and active. The  H19 gene is  hypomethylated and the downstream enhancers can effectively induce its expression. The upstream Igf2 which is also regulated by the same enhancers however remains inactive. On the paternal DNA strand the ICR is hypermethylated. The H19 gene is also hypermethylated and is not accessible to the downstream enhancers. They now can only activate Igf2. When the maternal DNA strand's epigenome is converted to paternal pattern both copies of Igf2 are expressed. This derangement results in Beckwith-Wiedeman syndrome (BWS) and Wilms tumor. BWS is a disorder associated with multiple childhood malignancies and congenital defects. Children with Beckwith-Wiedeman syndrome are &gt;600 times more likely to develop certain childhood cancers compared to their healthy counterparts.  Wilms tumor - a rare childhood kidney tumor, is the direct result from inactivating mutation in the WT1 gene with resultant loss of maternal imprinting of H19/Igf2. This effect is seen in the kidney which is derived from the mesenchyme - the fetal tissue type that is affected selectively by this mechanism.  <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug developed by Eisai for the treatment of myeloproliferative disorders such as lymphomas and leukemias. The mechanism of action of decitabine is through DNA demethylation. It thus is most efficacious for treatment of cancers that are the result from CpG island hypermethylation and ensuing suppression of any tumor suppressor genes residing in the vicinity of these islands. Tumor suppressor genes prevent uncontrolled cell division, prevent cancer cell invasion of neighboring tissues and blood vessels and promote the natural susceptibility of the cell to programmed cell death when needed. Decitabine and other similar drugs suppress tumorigenesis by rescuing tumor suppressor genes. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks are heritable and are passed from the cell to the daughter cells. Epigenetic marks are established in utero during the blastocyst stage and are set and stable in every tissue for the lifespan of the individual. One exception to this rule is the germline. Since only one copy of DNA is carried in the germline so that after fertilization the fertilized egg has the normal amount of DNA and one copy of each chromosome from each parent, the epigenetic marks are wiped clean in the germ line. This is to prevent the same imprinting on both chromosomes which often leads to devastating genetic and developmental disoders or unviable embrio. The blastocyst stage and the germline development are known as epigenetically sensitive periods. After the epigenetic marks are set in the early development stage they are fixed for the lifetime of the individual unless an insult to the tissue results in epigenetic derangement as often seen in cancers. Given what we know about the epigenome - namely that it is stable and propagated through to all daughter cells, many potent drugs that affect the epigenome of cancer tissue are being actively developed as disease modifying treatments.<br /></div>
