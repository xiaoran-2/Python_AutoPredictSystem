    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the
normal the genome wide methylation is maintain at higher levels to maintain
genome stability alternatively the CpG islands are kept at low levels of
methylation as their function is involved in gene silencing and therefore are
protected. In relation to the cancer cells there is a hyper methylation of CpG
islands and a consequential suppression of tumour suppressor genes. The hyper
methylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores results in the silencing of
tumour suppressor genes and allows the genetic instability to increase and the
cancer cell to flourish without opposition.</p>

<p>The
normal DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements prevents
genomic instability by protecting these regions from transcription and subsequent
mutations due to their ability to copy, cut and paste themselves in the genome.
The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypo-methylated in cancer
and as a result, there is a subsequent increase in mutations. The consequence
of hypo-methylation is genomic instability allowing repetitive elements and
intergenic regions to be transcribed; resulting in abnormal karyotypes such as
insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocations.</p>



<p>In
summary the DNA hypo methylation cause mutations that as a consequence will
result in either a gain or loss of function attribute that will enable the
cancer to establish the “Hallmarks of cancer”. Furthermore, the hyper methylation
of CpG islands and shores result in silencing of tumour suppressor genes and in
co-ordination both these change allow for cancer genesis with the suppression
of controls will facilitate proliferation, invasion and metastasis<i>.</i></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In the
paternal allele there is no binding of the CTCF insulator protein due to
methylation of the ICR blocking its binding, this spreads to H19 promoter and it results in it's silencing. Finally this allows
the enhancers to access Igf2 with a concomitant over expression.  Alternatively the maternal allele lacks
methylation at the ICR and therefore the CTCF complex, binds, allows for the
expression of H19 and blocks the activity of enhancers on Igf2 preventing its
expression. </span></p>

<p>In Wilm’s
tumour there is hyper methylation of the ICR therefore both allele are same as
the paternal allele. There is a consequential over expression of Igf2, which is
associated with growth and development in various tissue types, and as a result,
there is an increase in cell proliferation. The changes in methylation can
result in loss of imprinting and as such in reference to H19/Igf2 there will be
a loss of growth control genes and an increase the activity of growth promotion.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a class of DNMT inhibitor, this
inhibitor will prevent the methylation of the daughter strand, as DNMT is
specific for hemi methylated DNA and its function is to attach the corresponding parental methyl group
on the daughter strand. Decitabine, actively enters the nucleus, incorporates into
the DNA and then irreversibly binds to DNMT. This drug if used at low dose can
reduce DNA methylation and allow for an increase in tumour suppressor expression.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
alteration of DNA methylation will have a long lasting impact as they are
mitotically heritable, therefore this change will be passed from the parental strand onto to daughter strand and
so forth and removed indefinitely. Therefore, it will continue after the
treatment has ceased. An example would be de methylation that resulted in the
expression of a tumour suppressor; this would continue in each generation
therefore it would be a treatment and a preventative. </p>

<p>Sensitive
periods are times when the cell are most vulnerable to epigenome disruptions
and occur during resetting periods such as primordial germ cell development and
pre-implantation. Treating patients during sensitive periods is not advisable
because it would change epigenetic marks in the germ cell and it in itself would
result in imprinting disorders, mutations and cancerogenesis.</p>

<p><span>In
summary therapy targeting epigenetics is favourable because these changes are
reversible unlike mutations although they are closely related but it should be approached cautiously as there
could be  detrimental global effects.</span></p>
