    <h1>Submission 616 from Anon (session_user_id: 093d49ebb390ede914d7c4c5748f1e149b323b98)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands are generally unmethylated (although this is locus specific), however in cancer, these areas become hyper-methylated; frequently working to silence tumour suppressor genes. These changes are mitotically heritable and can contribute to the cells being able to reproduce more quickly than healthy cells resulting in a cancerous mass.<br />In contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in the genome are generally methylated, which works to silence the regions and stops transposable elements from relocating through the genome. In cancer, genome wide hypomethylation works to remove these markers and these regions become active. This results in more genomic instability and higher rates of inappropriate recombination, resulting in more "damaged" or "non-functional" genes, further adding to the disease state of the cell mass.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In non-cancerous cells, the paternal Igf2 allele is unmethylated, and the maternal is. The maternal strand's production of Igf2 is silenced, allowing the production of cdknic, a tumour suppressor. In cancer, this region can become hypomethylated, which causes the maternal strand to act as the paternal, resulting in an increase in Igf2 and a decrease in cdknic, this increase in Igf2 may cause the tumour to have increased rapid growth and the decrease in cdknic may further contribute to the disease state.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylator, meaning it reduces the amount of DNA methylation across the genome. In cases where tumours are reliant on hypermethylation at CpG islands, the use of this type of drug could better the prognosis for effected individuals by removing the silencing on many affected tumour suppressor genes and work to return the genome to a pre-cancerous epigenetic state<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have a lasting effect as such changes are mitotically heritable and, if the inappropriate methylation leading to the cancerous state is removed during the replication of these cells by the drug treatment, the correct form of the methylation will then be passed on rather than the cancerous state, resulting in the stoppage of tumour growth and development. Using these drugs in sensitive periods, i.e. when the epigenome is being erased or reprogrammed, such as clearing of the epigenome in gametes or early development, could result in further inappropriate markers and a long-lasting incorrect epigenomic state as once set, these markers would be maintained throughout the organism's life. <br />Further, globally influencing epigenomic markers during early childhood may be inadvisable as these changes may not be limited to the cancerous cells and could influence the production of proteins and hormones required for normal development.<br /></div>
