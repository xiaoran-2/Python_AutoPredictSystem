    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, a nucleoside analogue, is a DNA-demethylating drug, approved by the FDA to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which potentially progress to acute myelogenous leukaemia, or AML. Decitabine acts as an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases and it therefore generally reduces the methylation level of DNA. Although its mechanism of action remains unclear, it is expected that it can reduce aberrant hypermethylation of CpG islands by passive demethylation, i.e. its inhibitory effect prevents epigenetic marks to be replicated during mitosis. In contrast to the genome-wide hypomethylation usually found in cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated in cancerous cells, thus leading to silencing of tumor suppressor genes and therefore promoting cancer. In summary, decatibine is thought to revert hypermethylation, particularly in replicating cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">It is becoming increasingly clear that epigenetic marks, in particular DNA methylation, are frequently altered in cancerous processes. For instance, CpG islands, which are often found in gene promoters and enhancers, are normally found unmethylated. In contrast, cancer is often characterized by hypermethylation of CpG islands and so-called CpG shores (regions of a few Kbs surrounding CpG islands). Importantly, many of the genes involved are tumor suppressor genes. Because methylation of promoters is usually linked to reduced gene expression, hypermethylated CpG islands can lead to deregulation of cancer suppression and hence to cell proliferation. The latter implies that these epimutations are quickly selected.

Conversely, high levels of methylation are normally found at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, where methylation prevents spurious recombination and transposition. Unlike CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are commonly hypomethylated in cancer cells. As a consequence, repeats are activated and abnormal recombination between them occurs, often introducing deletions, insertions and translocations and generally leading to genomic instability. Consistent with this view, deletion of methyl transferases, such as Dnmt1, has been shown to increase genome instability in mouse models. Similarly, mutations in human DNMT3B lead to an ICF syndrome, also characterised by genomic instability. A consequence of such abnormal epigenetic control is the activation of cryptic promoters and the disruption of neighbouring genes, all of which contribute to tumorigenic processes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism that differentially controls gene expression of maternal and paternal alleles. For instance, in the H19/Igf2 gene cluster, expression of Igf2 requires access to a downstream enhancer. However, when the CTCF blocking protein binds a cluster site between the Igf2 gene and the enhancer, the latter becomes inaccessible and Igf2 is not expressed. In addition, transcription of H19 can proceed towards the enhancer, thus providing a second blocking mechanism.

In the paternal allele, normal imprinting leads to methylation of the CTCF binding site, preventing CTCF binding and enabling the enhancer to reach Ifg2. Furthermore, methylation extends to the H19 promoter, which cannot be transcribed. Therefore the Ifg2 gene is expressed.

In the maternal allele, on the other hand, the CTCF binding site is hypomethylated. Hence, CTCF can block the enhancer and Ifg2 is silenced. Moreover, the H19 promoter is also hypomethylated, allowing H19 transcription and further down-regulating Ifg2 expression.

In Wilm's tumor, H19/Ifg2 imprinting is disrupted so that the maternal allele is methylated following the paternal pattern. Consequently, Ifg2 is overexpressed in the tumor. Since Ifg2 is a growth restriction gene, imprinting disruption by hypermethylation of the H19/Ifg2 leads to tumorigenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, since during DNA replication hemimethylases are able to copy DNA methyl epigenetic marks from parent to child strands. Thus, drugs that alter methylation levels can have lasting effects on the epigenome of somatic cells. There exist sensitive periods when the whole epigenome, or large portions of it, are reset. During these periods, environmental changes, including drugs, have an effect on epigenetic control that can be passed on to the next generation. The two main sensitive periods of development are gametogenesis, when primordial germ cells are produced, and early preimplantation embryonic development. Treating patients during sensitive periods is not recommended because permanent effects on epigenetic control could passed to their offspring.</div>
