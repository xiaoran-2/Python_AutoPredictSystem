    <h1>Submission 810 from Anon (session_user_id: 1bc2c60698ac49f4fcbacb13fed97f353f6c1305)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylaton agent. Using this drug, we would see a genome wide decreased methylation. Cancer cells can arise from the methylation  of CpG islands associated with the promoters of  tumour supressor genes, silencing them. By reactivating these genes in a permanent fashion, as epigenetic characteristics are maintained through mitosis, we would have an effective way of fighting cancer. Although not risk free, as healthy cells share the same mechanisms, cancer cells would the most affected due to their abnormal proliferation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer, a genome-wide loss of DNA methylation and a regional gain ( as seen in CpG islands) is observed. CpG islands tend to be demethylated in normal cells. In cancer cells, methylation of these regions that are associated with gene promoters means silencing of possible tumour supressor genes. Repetitive sequences and remnants of retroviral insertions, such as LINEs an SINEs, are usually methylated in healthy cells to avoid unwanted transcription. However hypomethylation of these regions contribute to genome instability and these cells are therefore prone to develop into cancer cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprinted control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal. CTCF( an insulator protein) binds to the maternal ICR preventing Igf2 transcription by insulating Igf2 from the enhancers, promoting in this way the transcription of the long non coding RNA H19 instead. The paternal ICR being methylated, CTCF cannot bind, and therefore Igf2 is paternally expressed. If there is over expression of Igf2, a growth factor, the possibility of cancer arises. This can happen due to mutation at the ICR region or at the CTCF gene disrupting protein binding, an alteration on the epigenetic state (aberrant methylation of the ICR) or an extra parental chromossome.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark, which is maintained even through cell division. Reprogramming of DNA methylation is the only time where these marks can be erased and reset. This event occurs during gametogenesis and early embryo development. As one would imagine, these periods are "sensitive" because they establish the very specific epigenome of the egg and sperm (that have unique cell characteristics), and of the embryo, that needs very specific commands for proper development. Altering in any way these epigenomes would result in faulty gametes and irregular embryo development.</div>
