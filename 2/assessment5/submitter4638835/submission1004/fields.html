    <div class="field-value">           DNA methylation is a epigenetic process by which cells control their gene expression. Methylation occurs at  5' cytosine residues of CpG islands which are a stretch of CG dinucleotides, by DNA methyl transferases (DNMT).Methylation also occurs at intergenic regions which belongs to non coding DNA and as well as  at repetitive sequences of DNA . These repetitive elements may be transposons, retrotransposons  that duplicate themselves and insert into random regions in DNA. These random insertions may cause deleterious effects such as deletions, translocations in the inserted gene which may alter the respective gene function or inactivate an active gene; thereby causing mutagenic effects.<br />                        Therefore DNA methylation at these regions inactivates these regions and hence might control uncontrolled cell growth. Methylation occurs at the promoters of CpG islands and hence blocking binding of transcription factors at the promoters. Normal function of methylation is to maintain genomic integrity and stability. It also prevents illegitimate recombination of DNA. Illegitimate recombination may be mutagenic and can lead to cancer.<br /> <br /> Mostly some of the CpG islands are in  promoters of Tumour suppressor genes (TSG). So hypermethylation of these islands blocks the  transcription of these genes causing loss of controlled cell divisions. These may occur at several promoter regions of TSG. As TSGs are important for normal cell growth and prevents uncontrolled cell divisions, loss of their function or their inactivation may ultimately lead to cancer.Hyper/hypo methylation of DNA have been known to cause malignancies. Alternations in DNA methylation at Imprint control regions results in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and causes overexpression of growth promoting genes which leads to cancer. eg- RB gene in retinoblastoma. In normal cell CpG islands are unmethylated and intergenic and repetitive regions are are methylated. But in cancer, CpG are hypermethylated and intergenic/ repetitive elements are unmethylated or hypomethylated.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alternations of DNA methylation at Imprint control (ICR) regions that is either hyper or hypomethylation causes overexpression of growth promoting genes which ultimately leads to cancer.<br />Example is Wilm's tumour which is cancer of the kidneys typically occuring in children. It is caused by loss of WT1 gene which is a tumour suppressor gene.<br /><br />H19 is long noncoding RNA.  Igf2 gene in humans is located on chromosome 11 which contains numerous imprinted genes and produces growth promoting hormones during gestation. H19/Igf2 shows parent -of -origin  specific monoallelic expression.H19 is expressed from maternal chromosome and Igf2 from paternal. The two genes share enhancer elements and expression of both genes depends on cis acting sequences upstream of H19 promoter. Enhancers activate H19 of maternal chromosome and Igf2 in paternal chromsome. <br /><br /><br />In normal cell, ICR is unmethylated in maternal allele and thus CTCF which is a protein involved in repressing the gene expression, binds to ICR and insulates it and H19 is expressed. In paternal copy, H19 promoter is hypermethlated so CTCF cannot bind to it and hence enhancers bind to Igf2 promoter and causes its expression.<br />In Wilms tumour, both the maternal and paternal copies of ICRs are methylated, thereby causing overexpession of Igf2 and hence causing tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> There are certain drugs which act as inhibitors of epigenetic events.  Decitabine is one such drug,  is a cytidine analog,  belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors. It is a hypomethylating /demethylating  agent. It inhibits DNA methylation.<br /><br />It is used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes where abnormally shaped blood cells are produced.<br /> <br />Tumour suppressor genes(TSG) are required for controlling cellular growth. Promoters of these TSGs have CpG islands which  mostly becomes methylated during DNA modification. Methylation inactivates these TSGs and thus loss of their function. Many of such events together leads to cancer.<br /><br />Decitabine being a hypomethylating agent, on administration demethylates such methylated CpG islands in promoter regions. On demethylation, transcription of TSGs takes place thereby preventing uncontrolled cellular division  and regulating cellular growth and preventing tumour. This helps normal production of blood cells. It also blocks  multiplication of cancer cells and thus has an anti tumour effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Accumulation of epigenetic and genetic mutations in cells causes cancer. Certain drugs can alter the epigenetic changes and effects and thus play a role in having an anti-tumour effect.  An example is Decitabine which is a hypomethylating agent which demethylates the hypermethylated promoters of Tumour suppressor genes and therefore restricts cellular growth and  also stops reproduction of cancer cells. DNA methylation  at the promoters of TSGs inactivates them and causes cancer. Differential methyation pattern at H19-Igf2 in maternal and paternal copies at Chromosome 11 also plays a significant role in normal cellular growth.<br /><br />DNA methylation with its stable and heritable nature has long lasting effects in development.<br /><br />Period where environment influences genetic make up is sensitive period. Periods of active remodelling of the genome where there is removal and laying of epigenetic marks at different places in the genome.<br /><br />Period of primordial germ cell development all the way through production of mature eggs and sperms is one sensitive period. Second sensitive period is the preimplantion period and early post implantation.<br />These periods are most sensitive to changes in the environment.<br /><br />If patients are treated during sensitive periods, then there will be long lasting effects in the genome. As these modifications are inherited, the effects of  environment i.e. drugs will be seen in future generations also.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
