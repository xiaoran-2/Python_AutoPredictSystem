    <h1>Submission 286 from Anon (session_user_id: 47e4f5a52c03ea9d50d6a97b6b6b8050b262cc71)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Cancers cells are associated with hypermethylated CpG islands (CGI) in gene promoters and CpG shores (2kb near CGI), while normal cell are asocaited with unmethylated CPI. </span></p><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent and it is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. It is a cytidine analog and in low doses it acts as an inhibitor for DNA-Methyltransferase. </span></p><p>









</p><p><span>So the anti-tumoral effect can be understood as restoring normal conditions in cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal somatic mammalian cells, CpG Islands (CGI) are 70-80% methylated. 60% of promoters have CGI and they are kept free of methylation. Methylation is associated with gene silencing and are responsable for phenomena such as imprinting genes, X inactivation and formation of heterochromatine. There are also transcription factors as CTCF which are sensible to 5mC that can regulated different genes to be exprese wether or not a specific region is methylated.</p>
<p>In a simplified manner we know that activating oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes can lead to cancer. And that can be achieved by genetic mutations or epigenetic disruption.</p>
<p>Several studies have shown that in cancer cells, globally 5mC is decreased but some particularly CGI are methylated. Studies shows that it is more frequently to have a tumor suppressor hypermethylated (silenced) than a mutation.</p>
<p><span>Main function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive element are associated with genomic stability, loosing this marks may end up in chromosome duplication, delation and reciprocal translocation. This is expressed as an abnormal karyotype. Imagine that a delation or a translocation can take out the reading frame. The way methylation may help in genomic stability is due to leading DNA in heterochoramtine state, so being more densely package it is less accessible to illegitimate recombination. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Imprinted Control Region (ICR) up-stream of lgf2 and down-stream of H19 it is heavily methylated at the paternal allele and unmethylated at the maternal allele. If it is unmethylated the CTCF protein witch is a transcription factor can bind to the DNA blocking the transcription of lgf2 while enchancecing H19 by allowing enchancers in DNA to loop back and act in H19 or lgf2 depending if CTCF is bind or not. So having this imprinting regions asures to have the right amount copies of each protein.</p>
<p><span>Some times this particularly ICR is methylated in both alleles, leading in no expression of H19 and over expression of lgf2. This particular abnormality it is known as Wilm’s tumor as it lead to a specific type of cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are pass through cell’s generation and that gives a lasting effect. That is the difference between acting epigeneticly rather than with transcription factors.</p>
<p>In some stages of development the epigenetic marks are actively being remodel and this is known as sensitive periods. This periods are during primordial germ cell development, pre implantation and early implantation.</p>
<p><span>As anyone may expect if you alter any parameter which could have effects on epigenetic marks, they may lead in abnormal cell development.</span></p></div>
