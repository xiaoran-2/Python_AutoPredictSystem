    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In a normal cell, CpG
islands are hypomethylated, while the intergenic and repetitive elements are
hypermethylated. In a cancer cell, these positions are switched, with
methylation more likely at the CpG islands and less likely elsewhere. The
methylation of CpG islands indicates silencing of that gene. The methylation at
CpG islands in cancer cells occur at tumor suppression location, silencing the
mechanism that suppression tumor growth. The hypomethylation at the intergenic
region can cause instability events like reciprocal translocations. The
hypomethylation causes open chromatin, which allows for the unnatural
recombination to occur. If repetitive areas of the genome are hypomethylated,
it can allow those areas to replicate themselves and insert into other places
in the genome. These increased levels of insertions, deletions and reciprocal
translocation is a hallmark of cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>


















</p><p><span>Another hallmark of cancer
cells is the lack of imprinting, so in these cases either the gene of both
parents or neither parents are expressed, rather than just the gene of one.
This may be the case because genes that are imprinted tend to be related to growth.
Unlike the change in methylation at CpG sites, either hyper- or hypomethylation
can occur in cancer cells, depending on the phenotype of that gene would be,
i.e. silencing a growth suppression gene. In the paternal allele, the ICR is
methylated and the enhancers are able to act on the Igf2. In the maternal
allele, the ICR is hypomethylated, allowing CTCF to bind and making the
enhancers act on H19 and not Igf2. In Wilm’s tumor, both maternal and parental
ICR are methylated, so both Igf2 are activating, effectively doubling the amount
of Igf2, which is a growth promoter.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that is taken
into the genome. Later, when the DNMT comes to bind to the gene to transfer
methylation sites onto the daughter strand, it is irreversibly attached to the
DNMTi, effectively ending the transfer of these sites. This can only happen in
dividing cells and since tumor cells are quickly dividing, this allows the
DNMTi’s effects to have a larger impact there. This causes a demethylation
effect on the tumor cells. While the method of action is largely unknown, it’s
possible that the DNMTi’s are affecting the hypermethylated CpG islands. The
now demethylated CpG islands are more like what is found in a normal cell.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The most important part of
DNA methylation is its ability to be passed mitotically. By altering the
methylation marks on the genome, these epigenetic markers can be passed through
the line of the cell. The effects of the drugs are not only occurring while
they are administered, but by changing epigenetic makeup they can have long
lasting effects. A sensitive period is a time period where the cell is particularly
fragile to environmental changes. This is generally a period of overall gene
instability. A specific time would be when the germ cells are developing. If a
drug that inhibits epigenetic markers was taken during this development, the
germ cell’s would have a very different epigenetic make-up than expected, which
could have unforeseen effects on the future offspring.</span><b></b></p></div>
