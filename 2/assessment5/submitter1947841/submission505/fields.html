    <div class="field-value">CpG methylation refers to the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine nucleotide when it is immediately followed by a guanine in the DNA sequence. Since methylation is inherited by daughter cells after mitosis ("mitotically heritable"), a single cell's lineage will inherit any changes in its methylation.<br />CpG islands, sections of DNA that are rich in cytosine-guanine sequences, are dense within gene-promoter sequences,, and are rarely methylated, as methylation usually results in inactivation of the gene.  In cancerous cells, these sequences are more often methylated, "hypermethylated", than in normal cells,and the subsequent gene is inactivated or silenced. When the silenced gene serves tumor-suppressing, growth-limiting, apoptosis-producing, or similar regulatory  function, and that activity is silenced, the unrestrained growth typical of malignancy can result.<br />Many CpG sequences found elsewhere in the genome are normally methylated and expression is prevented or limited; this includes  repetitive elements, intergenic areas, imprinted genes, and possible viral genomic remnants..  In cancerous cells, these methyl groups are often absent(--and the total number of methylated sites in the cell is lower than normal, even considering the hypermethylated CpG islands). When these non-CpG-island methyl groups are absent, uncontrolled  transcription and loss of tissue specificity result, also hallmarks of malignancy.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />The maternal allelle of H19/Igf2 is unmethylated, which allows binding by a protein (CTCF), that prevents activation of Igf2 by an enhancer ; those enhancers then promote expression at the initial, unmethylated H19 site<br />The paternal allele  does not allow the protein to bind to the activator site, and thus allows activation of  the Igf2 site, and the methylated H19 is silent. Igf2 is a growth promoter gene that can also funtion as an oncogene. If , after an epigenetic error, a mutation that causes loss of imprinting, or two copies of the paternal allele, are expressed, the increase in the growth promoting activity leads to growth stimulation, including tumors.<br />Another nearby gene  is linked to H19/Igf2:  the Cdkn 2c gene  is maternally expressed, as a growth suppresser.  (Because of its proximity, these 2 areas will be acquired as a unit.)<br />If , because of one of the above-mentioned errors, a person expresses 2 copies of both paternal alleles, a syndrome (Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome) is produced. Igf2 is a growth producing gene, an oncogene, and Cdkn 1c is a tumor suppressor gene, so the combination of the increased Igf2 expression and loss of Cdkn 1c results in increased childhood  tumors , including Wilm's tumors</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, currently approved by the FDA to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and and is also used for acute myeloid leukemia.  It inhibits DNA methyltransferase, leading to lower levels of DNA methylation which will result in lower levels of CpG island methylation in cell progeny, reactivating some of the tumor suppressor and growth limiting genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dr. Baylin used a combination of a histone deacetylase inhibitor and  a DNA demethylating agent, azacitadine, and found that in addition to slowing tumor growth in some tumors, some tumors seemed more responsive to subsequent chemotherapy. If DNA demethylation removes methyl groups that are blocking tumor suppressor gene expression, these methyl group changes will be mitotically heritable and expressed in the progeny of the cells exhibiting those changes.  However, certain periods of epigenomic sensitivity, (times in development when large-scale epigenetic reprogramming are occurring) should be avoided--  specifically the times in early pregnancy when the initial epigenetic marks are being set (preimplantation in the embryo when epigenomic marks are cleared and reset), and when the germ cells of the developing fetus (midgestation, when the imprinted maternal and paternal gene markers are removed and reset) need to be avoided to prevent epigenetic abnormalities in the child and grandchildren, respectively, of the patient. Additional periods of cell differentiation could also be sensitive to these epigenetic therapies.</div>
